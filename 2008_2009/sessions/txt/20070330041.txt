    Subd. 3. Inventory; judicial determination; appeal; disposition of seized property. (a)
Within ten days after the seizure of any alleged contraband, the person making the seizure shall
serve by certified mail an inventory of the property seized on the person from whom the seizure
was made, if known, and on any person known or believed to have any right, title, interest, or lien
in the property, at the last known address, and file a copy with the commissioner. The notice must
include an explanation of the right to demand a judicial forfeiture determination.
   (b) Within 60 days after the date of service of the inventory, which is the date of mailing, the

person from whom the property was seized or any person claiming an interest in the property may
file a demand for a judicial determination of the question as to whether the property was lawfully
subject to seizure and forfeiture. The demand must be in the form of a civil complaint and must be
filed with the court administrator in the county in which the seizure occurred, together with proof of
service of a copy of the complaint on the commissioner of revenue, and the standard filing fee for
civil actions unless the petitioner has the right to sue in forma pauperis under section 563.01. If the
value of the seized property is $7,500 or less, the claimant may file an action in conciliation court
for recovery of the property. If the value of the seized property is less than $500, the claimant does
not have to pay the conciliation court filing fee.
    (c) The complaint must be captioned in the name of the claimant as plaintiff and the seized
property as defendant, and must state with specificity the grounds on which the claimant alleges
the property was improperly seized and the plaintiff's interest in the property seized. No responsive
pleading is required of the commissioner, and no court fees may be charged for the commissioner's
appearance in the matter. The proceedings are governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure.
Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an action for the return of property seized under this
section may not be maintained by or on behalf of any person who has been served with an inventory
unless the person has complied with this subdivision. The court shall decide whether the alleged
contraband is contraband, as defined in subdivision 1. The court shall hear the action without a jury
and shall try and determine the issues of fact and law involved.

to be sold at public auction as provided by law.
The person making a sale, after deducting the expense of keeping the property, the fee for seizure,
and the costs of the sale, shall pay all liens according to their priority, which are established as
being bona fide and as existing without the lienor having any notice or knowledge that the property
was being used or was intended to be used for or in connection with the violation. The balance of
the proceeds must be paid 75 percent to the Department of Revenue for deposit as a supplement
to its operating fund or similar fund for official use, and 25 percent to the county attorney or other
prosecuting agency that handled the court proceeding, if there is one, for deposit as a supplement
to its operating fund or similar fund for prosecutorial purposes. If there is no prosecuting authority
involved in the forfeiture, the 25 percent of the proceeds otherwise designated for the prosecuting
authority must be deposited into the general fund.
    (e) If no demand for judicial determination is made, the property seized is considered forfeited
to the state by operation of law and may be disposed of by the commissioner as provided in the case
of a judgment of forfeiture.

                                      CALL OF THE SENATE

   Senator Betzold imposed a call of the Senate for the balance of the proceedings on S.F. No. 1024.
The Sergeant at Arms was instructed to bring in the absent members.
   Senator Gerlach moved to amend S.F. No. 1024 as follows:
   Page 294, after line 12, insert:
   "Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 297E.02, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
     Subd. 4. Pull-tab and tipboard tax. (a) A tax is imposed on the sale of each deal of pull-tabs and
tipboards sold by a distributor. The rate of the tax is 1

or tipboard deal. The sales tax imposed by chapter 297A on the sale of the pull-tabs and tipboards by
the distributor is imposed on the retail sales price less the tax imposed by this subdivision. The retail
sale of pull-tabs or tipboards by the organization is exempt from taxes imposed by chapter 297A
and is exempt from all local taxes and license fees except a fee authorized under section 349.16,
subdivision 8.
    (b) The liability for the tax imposed by this section is incurred when the pull-tabs and tipboards
are delivered by the distributor to the customer or to a common or contract carrier for delivery to
the customer, or when received by the customer's authorized representative at the distributor's place
of business, regardless of the distributor's method of accounting or the terms of the sale.
    The tax imposed by this subdivision is imposed on all sales of pull-tabs and tipboards, except
the following:
   (1) sales to the governing body of an Indian tribal organization for use on an Indian reservation;
   (2) sales to distributors licensed under the laws of another state or of a province of Canada, as
long as all statutory and regulatory requirements are met in the other state or province;
   (3) sales of promotional tickets as defined in section 349.12; and
    (4) pull-tabs and tipboards sold to an organization that sells pull-tabs and tipboards under
the exemption from licensing in section 349.166, subdivision 2. A distributor shall require an
organization conducting exempt gambling to show proof of its exempt status before making a
tax-exempt sale of pull-tabs or tipboards to the organization. A distributor shall identify, on all
reports submitted to the commissioner, all sales of pull-tabs and tipboards that are exempt from
tax under this subdivision.
   (c) A distributor having a liability of $120,000 or more during a fiscal year ending June 30 must
remit all liabilities in the subsequent calendar year by electronic means.

    (d) Any customer who purchases deals of pull-tabs or tipboards from a distributor may file an
annual claim for a refund or credit of taxes paid pursuant to this subdivision for unsold pull-tab
and tipboard tickets. The claim must be filed with the commissioner on a form prescribed by the
commissioner by March 20 of the year following the calendar year for which the refund is claimed.
The refund must be filed as part of the customer's February monthly return. The refund or credit is
equal to 1­­7
           .­­1.5 percent of the face value of the unsold pull-tab or tipboard tickets, provided that
the refund or credit will be 1­­7

The refund claimed will be applied as a credit against tax owing under this chapter on the February
monthly return. If the refund claimed exceeds the tax owing on the February monthly return, that
amount will be refunded. The amount refunded will bear interest pursuant to section 270C.405 from
90 days after the claim is filed.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for pull-tab and tipboard tickets left unsold on
deals purchased after July 1, 2007."

   (2) the facility develops policies, procedures, and plans required under section 245A.65;
    (3) the facility documents an assessment of the 18- or 19-year-old person's risk of victimizing
children residing in the facility, and develops necessary risk reduction measures, including sleeping
arrangements, to minimize any risk of harm to children; and
    (4) notwithstanding the license holder's target population age range, whenever persons age 18 or
19 years old are receiving residential services, the age difference among residents may not exceed
five years.
   (c) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the license holder from seeking other variances under
subdivision 9.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245A.04, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 14. Policies and procedures for program administration required and enforceable. (a)
The license holder shall develop program policies and procedures necessary to maintain compliance
with licensing requirements under Minnesota Statutes and Minnesota Rules.
   (b) The license holder shall:
   (1) provide training to program staff related to their duties in implementing the program's policies
and procedures developed under paragraph (a);

   (3) monitor implementation of policies and procedures by program staff.
   (c) The license holder shall keep program policies and procedures readily accessible to staff
and index the policies and procedures with a table of contents or another method approved by the

   Subd. 15. Pandemic planning. Upon request, the license holder must cooperate with state
and local government disaster planning agencies working to prepare for or react to emergencies
presented by a pandemic outbreak.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245A.06, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Notice of conditional license; reconsideration of conditional license. If a license
is made conditional, the license holder must be notified of the order by certified mail or personal
service. If mailed, the notice must be mailed to the address shown on the application or the last
known address of the license holder. The notice must state the reasons the conditional license
was ordered and must inform the license holder of the right to request reconsideration of the
conditional license by the commissioner. The license holder may request reconsideration of the
1832                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [41ST DAY

order of conditional license by notifying the commissioner by certified mail or personal service.
The request must be made in writing. If sent by certified mail, the request must be postmarked and
sent to the commissioner within ten calendar days after the license holder received the order. If a
request is made by personal service, it must be received by the commissioner within ten calendar
days after the license holder received the order. The license holder may submit with the request
for reconsideration written argument or evidence in support of the request for reconsideration.
A timely request for reconsideration shall stay imposition of the terms of the conditional license
until the commissioner issues a decision on the request for reconsideration. If the commissioner
issues a dual order of conditional license under this section and an order to pay a fine under section
245A.07, subdivision 3, the license holder has a right to a contested case hearing under chapter 14
and Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612. The scope of the contested case hearing shall
include the fine and the conditional license. In this case, a reconsideration of the conditional license
will not be conducted under this section. If the license holder does not appeal the fine, the license
holder does not have a right to a contested case hearing and a reconsideration of the conditional
license must be conducted under this subdivision.
   The commissioner's disposition of a request for reconsideration is final and not subject to appeal
under chapter 14.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245A.07, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Immediate suspension expedited hearing. (a) Within five working days of receipt of
the license holder's timely appeal, the commissioner shall request assignment of an administrative
law judge. The request must include a proposed date, time, and place of a hearing. A hearing must
be conducted by an administrative law judge within 30 calendar days of the request for assignment,
unless an extension is requested by either party and granted by the administrative law judge for
good cause. The commissioner shall issue a notice of hearing by certified mail or personal service
at least ten working days before the hearing. The scope of the hearing shall be limited solely to
the issue of whether the temporary immediate suspension should remain in effect pending the
commissioner's final order under section 245A.08, regarding a licensing sanction issued under
subdivision 3 following the immediate suspension. The burden of proof in expedited hearings
under this subdivision shall be limited to the commissioner's demonstration that reasonable cause
exists to believe that the license holder's actions or failure to comply with applicable law or rule
poses, or if the actions of other individuals or conditions in the program poses an imminent risk of
harm to the health, safety, or rights of persons served by the program.
    (b) The administrative law judge shall issue findings of fact, conclusions, and a recommendation
within ten working days from the date of hearing. The parties shall have ten calendar days to
submit exceptions to the administrative law judge's report. The record shall close at the end of the
ten-day period for submission of exceptions. The commissioner's final order shall be issued within
ten working days from the close of the record. Within 90 calendar days after a final order affirming
an immediate suspension, the commissioner shall make a determination regarding whether a final
licensing sanction shall be issued under subdivision 3. The license holder shall continue to be
prohibited from operation of the program during this 90-day period.
    (c) When the final order under paragraph (b) affirms an immediate suspension, and a final
licensing sanction is issued under subdivision 3 and the license holder appeals that sanction,
the license holder continues to be prohibited from operation of the program pending a final
commissioner's order under section 245A.08, subdivision 5, regarding the final licensing sanction.

   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245A.07, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. License suspension, revocation, or fine. (a) The commissioner may suspend or revoke
a license, or impose a fine if a license holder fails to comply fully with applicable laws or rules, if a
license holder or, a controlling individual, an individual living in the household where the licensed
services are provided or is otherwise subject to a background study has a disqualification which
has not been set aside under section 245C.22, or if a license holder knowingly withholds relevant
information from or gives false or misleading information to the commissioner in connection with
an application for a license, in connection with the background study status of an individual, o       ­­
                                                                                                        r
during an investigation, or regarding compliance with applicable laws or rules. A license holder
who has had a license suspended, revoked, or has been ordered to pay a fine must be given notice of
the action by certified mail or personal service. If mailed, the notice must be mailed to the address
shown on the application or the last known address of the license holder. The notice must state the
reasons the license was suspended, revoked, or a fine was ordered.
    (b) If the license was suspended or revoked, the notice must inform the license holder of the right
to a contested case hearing under chapter 14 and Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612.
The license holder may appeal an order suspending or revoking a license. The appeal of an order
suspending or revoking a license must be made in writing by certified mail or personal service. If
mailed, the appeal must be postmarked and sent to the commissioner within ten calendar days after
the license holder receives notice that the license has been suspended or revoked. If a request is
made by personal service, it must be received by the commissioner within ten calendar days after
the license holder received the order. Except as provided in subdivision 2a, paragraph (c), a timely
appeal of an order suspending or revoking a license shall stay the suspension or revocation until the
commissioner issues a final order.
    (c)(1) If the license holder was ordered to pay a fine, the notice must inform the license holder of
the responsibility for payment of fines and the right to a contested case hearing under chapter 14 and
Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612. The appeal of an order to pay a fine must be made
in writing by certified mail or personal service. If mailed, the appeal must be postmarked and sent
to the commissioner within ten calendar days after the license holder receives notice that the fine
has been ordered. If a request is made by personal service, it must be received by the commissioner
within ten calendar days after the license holder received the order.
    (2) The license holder shall pay the fines assessed on or before the payment date specified. If
the license holder fails to fully comply with the order, the commissioner may issue a second fine
or suspend the license until the license holder complies. If the license holder receives state funds,
the state, county, or municipal agencies or departments responsible for administering the funds shall
withhold payments and recover any payments made while the license is suspended for failure to pay
a fine. A timely appeal shall stay payment of the fine until the commissioner issues a final order.
    (3) A license holder shall promptly notify the commissioner of human services, in writing, when
a violation specified in the order to forfeit a fine is corrected. If upon reinspection the commissioner
determines that a violation has not been corrected as indicated by the order to forfeit a fine, the
commissioner may issue a second fine. The commissioner shall notify the license holder by certified
mail or personal service that a second fine has been assessed. The license holder may appeal the
second fine as provided under this subdivision.
   (4) Fines shall be assessed as follows: the license holder shall forfeit $1,000 for each

determination of maltreatment of a child under section 626.556 or the maltreatment of a vulnerable
adult under section 626.557; the license holder shall forfeit $200 for each occurrence of a violation
of law or rule governing matters of health, safety, or supervision, including but not limited to the
provision of adequate staff-to-child or adult ratios, and failure to submit a background study; and
the license holder shall forfeit $100 for each occurrence of a violation of law or rule other than
those subject to a $1,000 or $200 fine above. For purposes of this section, "occurrence" means each
violation identified in the commissioner's fine order.
    (5) When a fine has been assessed, the license holder may not avoid payment by closing, selling,
or otherwise transferring the licensed program to a third party. In such an event, the license holder
will be personally liable for payment. In the case of a corporation, each controlling individual is
personally and jointly liable for payment.
      Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245A.07, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. Appeal of multiple sanctions. (a) When the license holder appeals more than one
licensing action or sanction that were simultaneously issued by the commissioner, the license holder
shall specify the actions or sanctions that are being appealed.
   (b) If there are different timelines prescribed in statutes for the licensing actions or sanctions
being appealed, the license holder must submit the appeal within the longest of those timelines
specified in statutes.
     (c) The appeal must be made in writing by certified mail or personal service. If mailed, the
appeal must be postmarked and sent to the commissioner within the prescribed timeline with the
first day beginning the day after the license holder receives the certified letter. If a request is made
by personal service, it must be received by the commissioner within the prescribed timeline with

sanctions simultaneously issued by the commissioner, the commissioner shall specify in the notice
to the license holder the timeline for appeal as specified under paragraph (b).
      Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245A.08, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
      Subd. 2a. Consolidated contested case hearings. (a) When a denial of a license under section
245A.05 or a licensing sanction under section 245A.07, subdivision 3, is based on a disqualification
for which reconsideration was requested and which was not set aside under section 245C.22, the
scope of the contested case hearing shall include the disqualification and the licensing sanction or
denial of a license, unless otherwise specified in this subdivision. When the licensing sanction or
denial of a license is based on a determination of maltreatment under section 626.556 or 626.557,
or a disqualification for serious or recurring maltreatment which was not set aside, the scope of
the contested case hearing shall include the maltreatment determination, disqualification, and the
licensing sanction or denial of a license, unless otherwise specified in this subdivision. In such
cases, a fair hearing under section 256.045 shall not be conducted as provided for in sections
245C.27, 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d. W                                                ­h­­

    (b) Except for family child care and child foster care, reconsideration of a maltreatment
determination under sections 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d, and
reconsideration of a disqualification under section 245C.22, shall not be conducted when:
    (1) a denial of a license under section 245A.05 or a licensing sanction under section 245A.07,
is based on a determination that the license holder is responsible for maltreatment or the
disqualification of a license holder is based on serious or recurring maltreatment;
    (2) the denial of a license or licensing sanction is issued at the same time as the maltreatment
determination or disqualification; and
    (3) the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination or disqualification, and denial of
a license or licensing sanction. In these cases, a fair hearing shall not be conducted under sections
245C.27, 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d. The scope of the contested case
hearing must include the maltreatment determination, disqualification, and denial of a license or
licensing sanction.
    Notwithstanding clauses (1) to (3), if the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination
or disqualification, but does not appeal the denial of a license or a licensing sanction, reconsideration
of the maltreatment determination shall be conducted under section 626.556, subdivision 10i, and
section 626.557, subdivision 9d, and reconsideration of the disqualification shall be conducted under
section 245C.22. In such cases, a fair hearing shall also be conducted as provided under sections
245C.27, 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d.
    (c) In consolidated contested case hearings regarding sanctions issued in family child care, child
foster care, family adult day services, and adult foster care, the county attorney shall defend the
commissioner's orders in accordance with section 245A.16, subdivision 4.
    ­
    (­) (d) The commissioner's final order under subdivision 5 is the final agency action on the issue
     c­
of maltreatment and disqualification, including for purposes of subsequent background studies under
chapter 245C and is the only administrative appeal of the final agency determination, specifically,
including a challenge to the accuracy and completeness of data under section 13.04.
    ­
    (d
     ­­) (e) When consolidated hearings under this subdivision involve a licensing sanction based on
a previous maltreatment determination for which the commissioner has issued a final order in an
appeal of that determination under section 256.045, or the individual failed to exercise the right to
appeal the previous maltreatment determination under section 626.556, subdivision 10i, or 626.557,
subdivision 9d, the commissioner's order is conclusive on the issue of maltreatment. In such cases,
the scope of the administrative law judge's review shall be limited to the disqualification and the
licensing sanction or denial of a license. In the case of a denial of a license or a licensing sanction
issued to a facility based on a maltreatment determination regarding an individual who is not the
license holder or a household member, the scope of the administrative law judge's review includes
the maltreatment determination.

     ) (f) The hearings of all parties may be consolidated into a single contested case hearing upon
consent of all parties and the administrative law judge, if:
   (1) a maltreatment determination or disqualification, which was not set aside under section
245C.22, is the basis for a denial of a license under section 245A.05 or a licensing sanction under

SYNDROME IN LICENSED PROGRAMS.
    When a license holder is placing an infant to sleep, the license holder must place the infant on the
infant's back, unless the license holder has documentation from the infant's physician directing an
alternative sleeping position for the infant, and must place the infant in a crib with a firm mattress.

or other soft products in the crib with the infant. Licensed child care providers must meet the crib
requirements under section 245A.146.

misdemeanor incident exposure involving a minor); 617.246 (use of minors in sexual performance
prohibited); or 617.247 (possession of pictorial representations of minors). An individual also is
disqualified under section 245C.14 regardless of how much time has passed since the involuntary
termination of the individual's parental rights under section 260C.301.
     (b) An individual's aiding and abetting, attempt, or conspiracy to commit any of the offenses
listed in paragraph (a), as each of these offenses is defined in Minnesota Statutes, permanently
disqualifies the individual under section 245C.14.
    (c) An individual's offense in any other state or country, where the elements of the offense are
substantially similar to any of the offenses listed in paragraph (a), permanently disqualifies the
individual under section 245C.14.
    (d) When a disqualification is based on a judicial determination other than a conviction, the
disqualification period begins from the date of the court order. When a disqualification is based on
an admission, the disqualification period begins from the date of an admission in court. When a
disqualification is based on a preponderance of evidence of a disqualifying act, the disqualification
date begins from the date of the dismissal, the date of discharge of the sentence imposed for a
conviction for a disqualifying crime of similar elements, or the date of the incident, whichever
occurs last.
    (e) If the individual studied commits one of the offenses listed in paragraph (a) that is specified
as a felony-level only offense, but the sentence or level of offense is a gross misdemeanor or
misdemeanor, the individual is disqualified, but the disqualification look-back period for the
offense is the period applicable to gross misdemeanor or misdemeanor offenses.

    (b) An individual is disqualified under section 245C.14 if less than seven years has passed since
a determination or disposition of the individual's:
    (1) failure to make required reports under section 626.556, subdivision 3, or 626.557, subdivision
3, for incidents in which: (i) the final disposition under section 626.556 or 626.557 was substantiated
maltreatment, and (ii) the maltreatment was recurring or serious; or
     (2) substantiated serious or recurring maltreatment of a minor under section 626.556, a
vulnerable adult under section 626.557, or serious or recurring maltreatment in any other state, the
elements of which are substantially similar to the elements of maltreatment under section 626.556
or 626.557 for which: (i) there is a preponderance of evidence that the maltreatment occurred, and
(ii) the subject was responsible for the maltreatment.
    (c) An individual is disqualified under section 245C.14 if less than seven years has passed since
the individual's aiding and abetting, attempt, or conspiracy to commit any of the offenses listed in
paragraphs (a) and (b), as each of these offenses is defined in Minnesota Statutes.

    (e) When a disqualification is based on a judicial determination other than a conviction, the
disqualification period begins from the date of the court order. When a disqualification is based on

disqualification is based on a preponderance of evidence of a disqualifying act, the disqualification
date begins from the date of the dismissal, the date of discharge of the sentence imposed for a
conviction for a disqualifying crime of similar elements, or the date of the incident, whichever
occurs last.

   Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.16, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Determining immediate risk of harm. (a) If the commissioner determines
that the individual studied has a disqualifying characteristic, the commissioner shall review the
information immediately available and make a determination as to the subject's immediate risk of
harm to persons served by the program where the individual studied will have direct contact with,
or access to, people receiving services.
   (b) The commissioner shall consider all relevant information available, including the following

factors in determining the immediate risk of harm:
   (1) the recency of the disqualifying characteristic;
   (2) the recency of discharge from probation for the crimes;
   (3) the number of disqualifying characteristics;
   (4) the intrusiveness or violence of the disqualifying characteristic;
   (5) the vulnerability of the victim involved in the disqualifying characteristic;
    (6) the similarity of the victim to the persons served by the program where the individual studied
will have direct contact; ­ an
                             ­d­
   (7) whether the individual has a disqualification from a previous background study that has not
been set aside.
              ­; and
    (8) if the individual has a disqualification which may not be set aside because it is a permanent
bar under section 245C.24, subdivision 1, the commissioner may order the immediate removal of the
individual from any position allowing direct contact with, or access to, persons receiving services
from the program.
    (c) This section does not apply when the subject of a background study is regulated by a
health-related licensing board as defined in chapter 214, and the subject is determined to be
responsible for substantiated maltreatment under section 626.556 or 626.557.
    (d) If the commissioner has reason to believe, based on arrest information or an active
maltreatment investigation, that an individual poses an imminent risk of harm to persons receiving
services, the commissioner may order that the person be continuously supervised or immediately
removed pending the conclusion of the maltreatment investigation or criminal proceedings.
   Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.17, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Disqualification notice sent to subject. (a) If the information in the study indicates the
individual is disqualified from direct contact with, or from access to, persons served by the program,
the commissioner shall disclose to the individual studied:
   (1) the information causing disqualification;
   (2) instructions on how to request a reconsideration of the disqualification;
    (3) an explanation of any restrictions on the commissioner's discretion to set aside the
disqualification under section 245C.24, when applicable to the individual;
    (4) a statement indicating that if the individual's disqualification is set aside or the facility is
granted a variance under section 245C.30, the individual's identity and the reason for the individual's
disqualification will become public data under section 245C.22, subdivision 7, when applicable to
the individual; and
   (5) the commissioner's determination of the individual's immediate risk of harm under section
245C.16.
   (b) If the commissioner determines under section 245C.16 that an individual poses an imminent

risk of harm to persons served by the program where the individual will have direct contact with, or
access to, people receiving services, the commissioner's notice must include an explanation of the
basis of this determination.
    (c) If the commissioner determines under section 245C.16 that an individual studied does
not pose a risk of harm that requires immediate removal, the individual shall be informed of the
conditions under which the agency that initiated the background study may allow the individual

contact with, or access to, people served by the program, the commissioner shall order the license
holder to immediately remove the individual studied from any position allowing direct contact with,
or access to, people served by the program.
    (c) If the commissioner determines under section 245C.16 that an individual studied poses a risk
of harm that requires continuous, direct supervision, the commissioner shall order the applicant,
license holder, or other entities as provided in this chapter to:

   (2) the Data Practices Act under chapter 13 provides for release of the information; or
   (3) the individual studied authorizes the release of the information.
   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.21, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Time frame for requesting reconsideration. (a) When the commissioner sends
an individual a notice of disqualification based on a finding under section 245C.16, subdivision
2, paragraph (a), clause (1) or (2), the disqualified individual must submit the request for a
reconsideration within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice of disqualification.
If mailed, the request for reconsideration must be postmarked and sent to the commissioner
within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice of disqualification. If a request for
reconsideration is made by personal service, it must be received by the commissioner within 30
calendar days after the individual's receipt of the notice of disqualification. Upon showing that the
information under subdivision 3 cannot be obtained within 30 days, the disqualified individual may
request additional time, not to exceed 30 days, to obtain the information.
     (b) When the commissioner sends an individual a notice of disqualification based on a finding
under section 245C.16, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause (3), the disqualified individual must
submit the request for reconsideration within 15 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the

determinations. The request must be submitted within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt
of the notice of disqualification. If mailed, the request for reconsideration must be postmarked
and sent to the commissioner within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice of

disqualification.
    (d) Except for family child care and child foster care, reconsideration of a maltreatment
determination under sections 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d, and
reconsideration of a disqualification under section 245C.22, shall not be conducted when:
    (1) a denial of a license under section 245A.05, or a licensing sanction under section
245A.07, is based on a determination that the license holder is responsible for maltreatment or the
disqualification of a license holder based on serious or recurring maltreatment;
    (2) the denial of a license or licensing sanction is issued at the same time as the maltreatment
determination or disqualification; and
    (3) the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination, disqualification, and denial of
a license or licensing sanction. In such cases, a fair hearing under section 256.045 must not be
conducted under sections 245C.27, 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d. Under
section 245A.08, subdivision 2a, the scope of the consolidated contested case hearing must include
the maltreatment determination, disqualification, and denial of a license or licensing sanction.
    Notwithstanding clauses (1) to (3), if the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination
or disqualification, but does not appeal the denial of a license or a licensing sanction, reconsideration
of the maltreatment determination shall be conducted under section 626.556, subdivision 10i, and
section 626.557, subdivision 9d, and reconsideration of the disqualification shall be conducted under
section 245C.22. In such cases, a fair hearing shall also be conducted as provided under sections

              t­o ­; information for reconsideration. (a) The disqualified individual requesting
reconsideration must submit information showing that:
   (1) the information the commissioner relied upon in determining the underlying conduct that
gave rise to the disqualification is incorrect;
   (2) for maltreatment, the information the commissioner relied upon in determining that
maltreatment was serious or recurring is incorrect; or
    (3) the subject of the study does not pose a risk of harm to any person served by the applicant,
license holder, or other entities as provided in this chapter, by addressing the information required
under section 245C.22, subdivision 4.
    (b) In order to determine the individual's risk of harm, the commissioner may require additional
information from the disqualified individual as part of the reconsideration process. If the individual
fails to provide the required information, the commissioner may deny the individual's request.
   Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.22, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Risk of harm; set aside. (a) The commissioner may set aside the disqualification if
the commissioner finds that the individual has submitted sufficient information to demonstrate that
the individual does not pose a risk of harm to any person served by the applicant, license holder, or

other entities as provided in this chapter.
    (b) In determining whether the individual has met the burden of proof by demonstrating the
individual does not pose a risk of harm, the commissioner shall consider:
   (1) the nature, severity, and consequences of the event or events that led to the disqualification;
   (2) whether there is more than one disqualifying event;
   (3) the age and vulnerability of the victim at the time of the event;
   (4) the harm suffered by the victim;
   (5) vulnerability of persons served by the program;
   (6) the similarity between the victim and persons served by the program;
   ­
   (6
    ­­) (7) the time elapsed without a repeat of the same or similar event;
   ­
   (7
    ­­) (8) documentation of successful completion by the individual studied of training or
rehabilitation pertinent to the event; and
   ­
   (8
    ­­) (9) any other information relevant to reconsideration.
     (c) If the individual requested reconsideration on the basis that the information relied upon
to disqualify the individual was incorrect or inaccurate and the commissioner determines that the
information relied upon to disqualify the individual is correct, the commissioner must also determine
if the individual poses a risk of harm to persons receiving services in accordance with paragraph (b).
   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.22, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Scope of set aside. If the commissioner sets aside a disqualification under this section,
the disqualified individual remains disqualified, but may hold a license and have direct contact with
or access to persons receiving services. The commissioner's set aside of a disqualification is limited
solely to the licensed program, applicant, or agency specified in the set aside notice under section
245C.23, unless otherwise specified in the notice. For personal care provider organizations, the
commissioner's set-aside may further be limited to a specific individual who is receiving services.
   Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.24, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Ten-year bar to set aside disqualification. (a) The commissioner may not set aside
the disqualification of an individual in connection with a license to provide family child care
for children, foster care for children in the provider's home, or foster care or day care services
for adults in the provider's home if: (1) less than ten years has passed since the discharge of the
sentence imposed, if any, for the offense; or (2) when disqualified based on a preponderance of
evidence determination under section 2   ­4 ­A

    (b) The commissioner may not set aside the disqualification of an individual if less than ten years
have passed since the individual's aiding and abetting, attempt, or conspiracy to commit any of the
offenses listed in paragraph (a) as each of these offenses is defined in Minnesota Statutes.
    (c) The commissioner may not set aside the disqualification of an individual if less than ten
years have passed since the discharge of the sentence imposed for an offense in any other state or
country, the elements of which are substantially similar to the elements of any of the offenses listed
in paragraph (a).
   Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.27, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Fair hearing when disqualification is not set aside. (a) If the commissioner
does not set aside a disqualification of an individual under section 245C.22 who is disqualified on
the basis of a preponderance of evidence that the individual committed an act or acts that meet the
definition of any of the crimes listed in section 245C.15; for a determination under section 626.556
or 626.557 of substantiated maltreatment that was serious or recurring under section 245C.15; or
for failure to make required reports under section 626.556, subdivision 3; or 626.557, subdivision
3, pursuant to section 245C.15, subdivision 4, paragraph (b), clause (1), the individual may request
a fair hearing under section 256.045, unless the disqualification is deemed conclusive under section
245C.29.
    (b) The fair hearing is the only administrative appeal of the final agency determination for
purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual. The disqualified individual does not have the
right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of data under section 13.04.
   (c) Except as provided under paragraph (e), if the individual was disqualified based on a
conviction or admission to any crimes listed in section 245C.15, subdivisions 1 to 4, or for a
1864                                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                           [41ST DAY

disqualification under section 256.98, subdivision 8, the reconsideration decision under section
245C.22 is the final agency determination for purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual
and is not subject to a hearing under section 256.045. If the individual was disqualified based on a
judicial determination, that determination is treated the same as a conviction for purposes of appeal.
    (d) This subdivision does not apply to a public employee's appeal of a disqualification under
section 245C.28, subdivision 3.
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (c), if the commissioner does not set aside a disqualification of
an individual who was disqualified based on both a preponderance of evidence and a conviction
or admission, the individual may request a fair hearing under section 256.045, unless the
disqualifications are deemed conclusive under section 245C.29. The scope of the hearing conducted
under section 256.045 with regard to the disqualification based on a conviction or admission shall
be limited solely to whether the individual poses a risk of harm, according to section 256.045,
subdivision 3b. In this case, the reconsideration decision under section 245C.22 is not the final
agency decision for purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual.
     Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.28, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. License holder. (a) If a maltreatment determination or a disqualification for which
reconsideration was requested and which was not set aside is the basis for a denial of a license under
section 245A.05 or a licensing sanction under section 245A.07, the license holder has the right to a
contested case hearing under chapter 14 and Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612. The
license holder must submit the appeal under section 245A.05 or 245A.07, subdivision 3.

provided for under section 245A.08, subdivision 2a, if the denial of a license or licensing sanction

for serious or recurring maltreatment which was not set-aside, the scope of the contested case
hearing must include:
     (1) the maltreatment determination, if the maltreatment is not conclusive under section 245C.29;
     (2) the disqualification, if the disqualification is not conclusive under section 245C.29; and
   (3) the licensing sanction or denial of a license. In such cases, a fair hearing must not
be conducted under section 256.045. If the disqualification was based on a determination of
substantiated serious or recurring maltreatment under section 626.556 or 626.557, the appeal must
be submitted under sections 245A.07, subdivision 3, and 626.556, subdivision 10i, or 626.557,

subdivision 9d.
    (d) Except for family child care and child foster care, reconsideration of a maltreatment
determination under sections 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d, and
reconsideration of a disqualification under section 245C.22, must not be conducted when:
    (1) a denial of a license under section 245A.05, or a licensing sanction under section
245A.07, is based on a determination that the license holder is responsible for maltreatment or the
disqualification of a license holder based on serious or recurring maltreatment;
    (2) the denial of a license or licensing sanction is issued at the same time as the maltreatment
determination or disqualification; and
    (3) the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination, disqualification, and denial of
a license or licensing sanction. In such cases a fair hearing under section 256.045 must not be
conducted under sections 245C.27, 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d. Under
section 245A.08, subdivision 2a, the scope of the consolidated contested case hearing must include
the maltreatment determination, disqualification, and denial of a license or licensing sanction.
    Notwithstanding clauses (1) to (3), if the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination
or disqualification, but does not appeal the denial of a license or a licensing sanction, reconsideration
of the maltreatment determination shall be conducted under section 626.556, subdivision 10i, and
section 626.557, subdivision 9d, and reconsideration of the disqualification shall be conducted under
section 245C.22. In such cases, a fair hearing shall also be conducted as provided under sections
245C.27, 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d.

degree), 609.345 (criminal sexual conduct in the fourth degree), or 609.3451 (criminal sexual

    (3) failure to provide for necessary supervision or child care arrangements appropriate for a child
after considering factors as the child's age, mental ability, physical condition, length of absence, or
environment, when the child is unable to care for the child's own basic needs or safety, or the basic
needs or safety of another child in their care;
   (4) failure to ensure that the child is educated as defined in sections 120A.22 and 260C.163,
subdivision 11, which does not include a parent's refusal to provide the parent's child with
sympathomimetic medications, consistent with section 125A.091, subdivision 5;
     (5) nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that a child is neglected solely because
the child's parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's care in good faith selects and
depends upon spiritual means or prayer for treatment or care of disease or remedial care of the child
in lieu of medical care; except that a parent, guardian, or caretaker, or a person mandated to report
pursuant to subdivision 3, has a duty to report if a lack of medical care may cause serious danger
to the child's health. This section does not impose upon persons, not otherwise legally responsible
for providing a child with necessary food, clothing, shelter, education, or medical care, a duty to
provide that care;
    (6) prenatal exposure to a controlled substance, as defined in section 253B.02, subdivision 2,

functioning of the child which may be demonstrated by a substantial and observable effect in the
child's behavior, emotional response, or cognition that is not within the normal range for the child's
age and stage of development, with due regard to the child's culture.
    (g) "Physical abuse" means any physical injury, mental injury, or threatened injury, inflicted by a
person responsible for the child's care on a child other than by accidental means, or any physical or

1870                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [41ST DAY

relevant to the occurrence of event.
   Sec. 46. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 626.556, subdivision 10e, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10e. Determinations. (a) The local welfare agency shall conclude the family assessment
or the investigation within 45 days of the receipt of a report. The conclusion of the assessment or
investigation may be extended to permit the completion of a criminal investigation or the receipt of
expert information requested within 45 days of the receipt of the report.
    (b) After conducting a family assessment, the local welfare agency shall determine whether
services are needed to address the safety of the child and other family members and the risk of
subsequent maltreatment.
     (c) After conducting an investigation, the local welfare agency shall make two determinations:
first, whether maltreatment has occurred; and second, whether child protective services are needed.
    (d) If the commissioner of education conducts an assessment or investigation, the commissioner
shall determine whether maltreatment occurred and what corrective or protective action was taken
by the school facility. If a determination is made that maltreatment has occurred, the commissioner
shall report to the employer, the school board, and any appropriate licensing entity the determination
that maltreatment occurred and what corrective or protective action was taken by the school facility.
In all other cases, the commissioner shall inform the school board or employer that a report was
received, the subject of the report, the date of the initial report, the category of maltreatment alleged
as defined in paragraph (f), the fact that maltreatment was not determined, and a summary of the
specific reasons for the determination.
    (e) When maltreatment is determined in an investigation involving a facility, the investigating
agency shall also determine whether the facility or individual was responsible, or whether both the
facility and the individual were responsible for the maltreatment using the mitigating factors in
paragraph (i). Determinations under this subdivision must be made based on a preponderance of the
evidence and are private data on individuals or nonpublic data as maintained by the commissioner
of education.
   (f) For the purposes of this subdivision, "maltreatment" means any of the following acts or
omissions:
   (1) physical abuse as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (g);
   (2) neglect as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (f);
   (3) sexual abuse as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (d);
   (4) mental injury as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (m); or
   (5) maltreatment of a child in a facility as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (i).
    (g) For the purposes of this subdivision, a determination that child protective services are
needed means that the local welfare agency has documented conditions during the assessment
or investigation sufficient to cause a child protection worker, as defined in section 626.559,
subdivision 1, to conclude that a child is at significant risk of maltreatment if protective intervention
is not provided and that the individuals responsible for the child's care have not taken or are not
likely to take actions to protect the child from maltreatment or risk of maltreatment.
41ST DAY]                                FRIDAY, MARCH 30, 2007                                                1871

    (h) This subdivision does not mean that maltreatment has occurred solely because the child's
parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's care in good faith selects and depends
upon spiritual means or prayer for treatment or care of disease or remedial care of the child, in lieu
of medical care. However, if lack of medical care may result in serious danger to the child's health,
the local welfare agency may ensure that necessary medical services are provided to the child.
   (i) When determining whether the facility or individual is the responsible party, or whether
both the facility and the individual are responsible for determined maltreatment in a facility, the
investigating agency shall consider at least the following mitigating factors:
    (1) whether the actions of the facility or the individual caregivers were according to, and followed
the terms of, an erroneous physician order, prescription, individual care plan, or directive; however,
this is not a mitigating factor when the facility or caregiver was responsible for the issuance of the
erroneous order, prescription, individual care plan, or directive or knew or should have known of
the errors and took no reasonable measures to correct the defect before administering care;
    (2) comparative responsibility between the facility, other caregivers, and requirements placed
upon an employee, including the facility's compliance with related regulatory standards and the
adequacy of facility policies and procedures, facility training, an individual's participation in the
training, the caregiver's supervision, and facility staffing levels and the scope of the individual
employee's authority and discretion; and
   (3) whether the facility or individual followed professional standards in exercising professional
judgment.
    (j) Individual counties may implement more detailed definitions or criteria that indicate which
allegations to investigate, as long as a county's policies are consistent with the definitions in
the statutes and rules and are approved by the county board. Each local welfare agency shall
periodically inform mandated reporters under subdivision 3 who work in the county of the
definitions of maltreatment in the statutes and rules and any additional definitions or criteria that
have been approved by the county board.

reconsideration is not applicable in family assessments since no determination concerning
maltreatment is made. For investigations, except as provided under paragraph (e), an individual or
facility that the commissioner of human services, a local social service agency, or the commissioner
of education determines has maltreated a child, an interested person acting on behalf of the
child, regardless of the determination, who contests the investigating agency's final determination
regarding maltreatment, may request the investigating agency to reconsider its final determination
regarding maltreatment. The request for reconsideration must be submitted in writing to the
investigating agency within 15 calendar days after receipt of notice of the final determination
regarding maltreatment or, if the request is made by an interested person who is not entitled to
notice, within 15 days after receipt of the notice by the parent or guardian of the child. If mailed,
the request for reconsideration must be postmarked and sent to the investigating agency within 15
calendar days of the individual's or facility's receipt of the final determination. If the request for
reconsideration is made by personal service, it must be received by the investigating agency within
15 calendar days after the individual's or facility's receipt of the final determination. Effective

January 1, 2002, an individual who was determined to have maltreated a child under this section and
who was disqualified on the basis of serious or recurring maltreatment under sections 245C.14 and
245C.15, may request reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification.
The request for reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification must
be submitted within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice of disqualification
under sections 245C.16 and 245C.17. If mailed, the request for reconsideration of the maltreatment
determination and the disqualification must be postmarked and sent to the investigating agency
within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the maltreatment determination and notice of
disqualification. If the request for reconsideration is made by personal service, it must be received
by the investigating agency within 30 calendar days after the individual's receipt of the notice of
disqualification.
    (b) Except as provided under paragraphs (e) and (f), if the investigating agency denies the request
or fails to act upon the request within 15 working days after receiving the request for reconsideration,
the person or facility entitled to a fair hearing under section 256.045 may submit to the commissioner
of human services or the commissioner of education a written request for a hearing under that
section. Section 256.045 also governs hearings requested to contest a final determination of the
commissioner of education. For reports involving maltreatment of a child in a facility, an interested
person acting on behalf of the child may request a review by the Child Maltreatment Review Panel
under section 256.022 if the investigating agency denies the request or fails to act upon the request
or if the interested person contests a reconsidered determination. The investigating agency shall
notify persons who request reconsideration of their rights under this paragraph. The request must
be submitted in writing to the review panel and a copy sent to the investigating agency within 30
calendar days of receipt of notice of a denial of a request for reconsideration or of a reconsidered
determination. The request must specifically identify the aspects of the agency determination with
which the person is dissatisfied.
    (c) If, as a result of a reconsideration or review, the investigating agency changes the final
determination of maltreatment, that agency shall notify the parties specified in subdivisions 10b,
10d, and 10f.
    (d) Except as provided under paragraph (f), if an individual or facility contests the investigating
agency's final determination regarding maltreatment by requesting a fair hearing under section
256.045, the commissioner of human services shall assure that the hearing is conducted and a
decision is reached within 90 days of receipt of the request for a hearing. The time for action on
the decision may be extended for as many days as the hearing is postponed or the record is held
open for the benefit of either party.
    (e) Effective January 1, 2002, if an individual was disqualified under sections 245C.14 and
245C.15, on the basis of a determination of maltreatment, which was serious or recurring, and
the individual has requested reconsideration of the maltreatment determination under paragraph
(a) and requested reconsideration of the disqualification under sections 245C.21 to 245C.27,
reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and reconsideration of the disqualification shall
be consolidated into a single reconsideration. If reconsideration of the maltreatment determination
is denied or the disqualification is not set aside under sections 245C.21 to 245C.27, the individual
may request a fair hearing under section 256.045. If an individual requests a fair hearing on the
maltreatment determination and the disqualification, the scope of the fair hearing shall include both
the maltreatment determination and the disqualification.

     (f) Effective January 1, 2002, if a maltreatment determination or a disqualification based on
serious or recurring maltreatment is the basis for a denial of a license under section 245A.05 or
a licensing sanction under section 245A.07, the license holder has the right to a contested case
hearing under chapter 14 and Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612. As provided for
under section 245A.08, subdivision 2a, the scope of the contested case hearing shall include
the maltreatment determination, disqualification, and licensing sanction or denial of a license.
In such cases, a fair hearing regarding the maltreatment determination and disqualification shall
not be conducted under p               ­­a­r­

for family child care and child foster care, reconsideration of a maltreatment determination as
provided under this subdivision, and reconsideration of a disqualification as provided under section
245C.22, shall also not be conducted when:
    (1) a denial of a license under section 245A.05 or a licensing sanction under section 245A.07,
is based on a determination that the license holder is responsible for maltreatment or the
disqualification of a license holder based on serious or recurring maltreatment;
    (2) the denial of a license or licensing sanction is issued at the same time as the maltreatment
determination or disqualification; and
    (3) the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination or disqualification, and denial of
a license or licensing sanction.
    Notwithstanding clauses (1) to (3), if the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination
or disqualification, but does not appeal the denial of a license or a licensing sanction, reconsideration
of the maltreatment determination shall be conducted under section 626.556, subdivision 10i, and
section 626.557, subdivision 9d, and reconsideration of the disqualification shall be conducted under
section 245C.22. In such cases, a fair hearing shall also be conducted as provided under sections
245C.27, 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d.
   If the disqualified subject is an individual other than the license holder and upon whom a
background study must be conducted under chapter 245C, the hearings of all parties may be
consolidated into a single contested case hearing upon consent of all parties and the administrative
law judge.
    (g) For purposes of this subdivision, "interested person acting on behalf of the child" means a
parent or legal guardian; stepparent; grandparent; guardian ad litem; adult stepbrother, stepsister, or
sibling; or adult aunt or uncle; unless the person has been determined to be the perpetrator of the
maltreatment.
     Sec. 48. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 626.557, subdivision 9c, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9c. Lead agency; notifications, dispositions, and determinations. (a) Upon request of
the reporter, the lead agency shall notify the reporter that it has received the report, and provide
information on the initial disposition of the report within five business days of receipt of the report,
provided that the notification will not endanger the vulnerable adult or hamper the investigation.
     (b) Upon conclusion of every investigation it conducts, the lead agency shall make a final

disposition as defined in section 626.5572, subdivision 8.
   (c) When determining whether the facility or individual is the responsible party for substantiated
maltreatment or whether both the facility and the individual are responsible for substantiated
maltreatment, the lead agency shall consider at least the following mitigating factors:
    (1) whether the actions of the facility or the individual caregivers were in accordance with, and
followed the terms of, an erroneous physician order, prescription, resident care plan, or directive.
This is not a mitigating factor when the facility or caregiver is responsible for the issuance of the
erroneous order, prescription, plan, or directive or knows or should have known of the errors and
took no reasonable measures to correct the defect before administering care;
    (2) the comparative responsibility between the facility, other caregivers, and requirements
placed upon the employee, including but not limited to, the facility's compliance with related
regulatory standards and factors such as the adequacy of facility policies and procedures, the
adequacy of facility training, the adequacy of an individual's participation in the training, the
adequacy of caregiver supervision, the adequacy of facility staffing levels, and a consideration of
the scope of the individual employee's authority; and
   (3) whether the facility or individual followed professional standards in exercising professional
judgment.
    (d) The lead agency shall complete its final disposition within 60 calendar days. If the lead agency
is unable to complete its final disposition within 60 calendar days, the lead agency shall notify the
following persons provided that the notification will not endanger the vulnerable adult or hamper the
investigation: (1) the vulnerable adult or the vulnerable adult's legal guardian, when known, if the
lead agency knows them to be aware of the investigation and (2) the facility, where applicable. The
notice shall contain the reason for the delay and the projected completion date. If the lead agency is
unable to complete its final disposition by a subsequent projected completion date, the lead agency
shall again notify the vulnerable adult or the vulnerable adult's legal guardian, when known if the
lead agency knows them to be aware of the investigation, and the facility, where applicable, of the
reason for the delay and the revised projected completion date provided that the notification will not
endanger the vulnerable adult or hamper the investigation. A lead agency's inability to complete the
final disposition within 60 calendar days or by any projected completion date does not invalidate
the final disposition.
    (e) Within ten calendar days of completing the final disposition, the lead agency shall provide a
copy of the public investigation memorandum under subdivision 12b, paragraph (b), clause (1),
when required to be completed under this section, to the following persons: (1) the vulnerable
adult, or the vulnerable adult's legal guardian, if known unless the lead agency knows that the
notification would endanger the well-being of the vulnerable adult; (2) the reporter, if the reporter
requested notification when making the report, provided this notification would not endanger the
well-being of the vulnerable adult; (3) the alleged perpetrator, if known; (4) the facility; and (5)
the ombudsman for older Minnesotans, or the ombudsman for mental health and developmental
disabilities, as appropriate.
    (f) The lead agency shall notify the vulnerable adult who is the subject of the report or the
vulnerable adult's legal guardian, if known, and any person or facility determined to have maltreated
a vulnerable adult, of their appeal or review rights under this section or section 256.021.

    (g) The lead agency shall routinely provide investigation memoranda for substantiated reports to
the appropriate licensing boards. These reports must include the names of substantiated perpetrators.
The lead agency may not provide investigative memoranda for inconclusive or false reports to
the appropriate licensing boards unless the lead agency's investigation gives reason to believe that
there may have been a violation of the applicable professional practice laws. If the investigation
memorandum is provided to a licensing board, the subject of the investigation memorandum shall
be notified and receive a summary of the investigative findings.
    (h) In order to avoid duplication, licensing boards shall consider the findings of the lead agency
in their investigations if they choose to investigate. This does not preclude licensing boards from
considering other information.
    (i) The lead agency must provide to the commissioner of human services its final dispositions,
including the names of all substantiated perpetrators. The commissioner of human services shall
establish records to retain the names of substantiated perpetrators.

provided under paragraph (e), any individual or facility which a lead agency determines has
maltreated a vulnerable adult, or the vulnerable adult or an interested person acting on behalf of the
vulnerable adult, regardless of the lead agency's determination, who contests the lead agency's final
disposition of an allegation of maltreatment, may request the lead agency to reconsider its final
disposition. The request for reconsideration must be submitted in writing to the lead agency within
15 calendar days after receipt of notice of final disposition or, if the request is made by an interested
person who is not entitled to notice, within 15 days after receipt of the notice by the vulnerable
adult or the vulnerable adult's legal guardian. If mailed, the request for reconsideration must be
postmarked and sent to the lead agency within 15 calendar days of the individual's or facility's
receipt of the final disposition. If the request for reconsideration is made by personal service, it
must be received by the lead agency within 15 calendar days of the individual's or facility's receipt
of the final disposition. An individual who was determined to have maltreated a vulnerable adult
under this section and who was disqualified on the basis of serious or recurring maltreatment under
sections 245C.14 and 245C.15, may request reconsideration of the maltreatment determination
and the disqualification. The request for reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the
disqualification must be submitted in writing within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt
of the notice of disqualification under sections 245C.16 and 245C.17. If mailed, the request for
reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification must be postmarked
and sent to the lead agency within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice
of disqualification. If the request for reconsideration is made by personal service, it must be
received by the lead agency within 30 calendar days after the individual's receipt of the notice of
disqualification.
    (b) Except as provided under paragraphs (e) and (f), if the lead agency denies the request or fails
to act upon the request within 15 working days after receiving the request for reconsideration, the
person or facility entitled to a fair hearing under section 256.045, may submit to the commissioner
of human services a written request for a hearing under that statute. The vulnerable adult, or an
interested person acting on behalf of the vulnerable adult, may request a review by the Vulnerable
Adult Maltreatment Review Panel under section 256.021 if the lead agency denies the request or

fails to act upon the request, or if the vulnerable adult or interested person contests a reconsidered
disposition. The lead agency shall notify persons who request reconsideration of their rights under
this paragraph. The request must be submitted in writing to the review panel and a copy sent to the
lead agency within 30 calendar days of receipt of notice of a denial of a request for reconsideration
or of a reconsidered disposition. The request must specifically identify the aspects of the agency
determination with which the person is dissatisfied.
   (c) If, as a result of a reconsideration or review, the lead agency changes the final disposition, it
shall notify the parties specified in subdivision 9c, paragraph (d).
    (d) For purposes of this subdivision, "interested person acting on behalf of the vulnerable adult"
means a person designated in writing by the vulnerable adult to act on behalf of the vulnerable
adult, or a legal guardian or conservator or other legal representative, a proxy or health care agent
appointed under chapter 145B or 145C, or an individual who is related to the vulnerable adult, as
defined in section 245A.02, subdivision 13.
    (e) If an individual was disqualified under sections 245C.14 and 245C.15, on the basis of a
determination of maltreatment, which was serious or recurring, and the individual has requested
reconsideration of the maltreatment determination under paragraph (a) and reconsideration of
the disqualification under sections 245C.21 to 245C.27, reconsideration of the maltreatment
determination and requested reconsideration of the disqualification shall be consolidated into a
single reconsideration. If reconsideration of the maltreatment determination is denied or if the
disqualification is not set aside under sections 245C.21 to 245C.27, the individual may request a
fair hearing under section 256.045. If an individual requests a fair hearing on the maltreatment
determination and the disqualification, the scope of the fair hearing shall include both the
maltreatment determination and the disqualification.
     (f) If a maltreatment determination or a disqualification based on serious or recurring
maltreatment is the basis for a denial of a license under section 245A.05 or a licensing sanction
under section 245A.07, the license holder has the right to a contested case hearing under chapter
14 and Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612. As provided for under section 245A.08,

disqualification, and licensing sanction or denial of a license. In such cases, a fair hearing ­                                                    sh

conducted when:
    (1) a denial of a license under section 245A.05, or a licensing sanction under section
245A.07, is based on a determination that the license holder is responsible for maltreatment or the
disqualification of a license holder based on serious or recurring maltreatment;
    (2) the denial of a license or licensing sanction is issued at the same time as the maltreatment
determination or disqualification; and
    (3) the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination or disqualification, and denial of
a license or licensing sanction.

    Notwithstanding clauses (1) to (3), if the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination
or disqualification, but does not appeal the denial of a license or a licensing sanction, reconsideration
of the maltreatment determination shall be conducted under section 626.556, subdivision 10i, and
section 626.557, subdivision 9d, and reconsideration of the disqualification shall be conducted under
section 245C.22. In such cases, a fair hearing shall also be conducted as provided under sections
245C.27, 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d.
   If the disqualified subject is an individual other than the license holder and upon whom a
background study must be conducted under chapter 245C, the hearings of all parties may be
consolidated into a single contested case hearing upon consent of all parties and the administrative
law judge.
    (g) Until August 1, 2002, an individual or facility that was determined by the commissioner of
human services or the commissioner of health to be responsible for neglect under section 626.5572,
subdivision 17, after October 1, 1995, and before August 1, 2001, that believes that the finding
of neglect does not meet an amended definition of neglect may request a reconsideration of the
determination of neglect. The commissioner of human services or the commissioner of health shall
mail a notice to the last known address of individuals who are eligible to seek this reconsideration.
The request for reconsideration must state how the established findings no longer meet the elements
of the definition of neglect. The commissioner shall review the request for reconsideration and make
a determination within 15 calendar days. The commissioner's decision on this reconsideration is the
final agency action.
   (1) For purposes of compliance with the data destruction schedule under subdivision 12b,
paragraph (d), when a finding of substantiated maltreatment has been changed as a result of a
reconsideration under this paragraph, the date of the original finding of a substantiated maltreatment
must be used to calculate the destruction date.
    (2) For purposes of any background studies under chapter 245C, when a determination of
substantiated maltreatment has been changed as a result of a reconsideration under this paragraph,
any prior disqualification of the individual under chapter 245C that was based on this determination
of maltreatment shall be rescinded, and for future background studies under chapter 245C the
commissioner must not use the previous determination of substantiated maltreatment as a basis for
disqualification or as a basis for referring the individual's maltreatment history to a health-related
licensing board under section 245C.31.
   Sec. 50. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 626.5572, subdivision 17, is amended to read:
   Subd. 17. Neglect. "Neglect" means:
    (a) The failure or omission by a caregiver to supply a vulnerable adult with care or services,
including but not limited to, food, clothing, shelter, health care, or supervision which is:
    (1) reasonable and necessary to obtain or maintain the vulnerable adult's physical or mental
health or safety, considering the physical and mental capacity or dysfunction of the vulnerable adult;
and
   (2) which is not the result of an accident or therapeutic conduct.
    (b) The absence or likelihood of absence of care or services, including but not limited to, food,
clothing, shelter, health care, or supervision necessary to maintain the physical and mental health
1878                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [41ST DAY

of the vulnerable adult which a reasonable person would deem essential to obtain or maintain
the vulnerable adult's health, safety, or comfort considering the physical or mental capacity or
dysfunction of the vulnerable adult.
   (c) For purposes of this section, a vulnerable adult is not neglected for the sole reason that:
    (1) the vulnerable adult or a person with authority to make health care decisions for the
vulnerable adult under sections 144.651, 144A.44, chapter 145B, 145C, or 252A, or sections
253B.03 or 524.5-101 to 524.5-502, refuses consent or withdraws consent, consistent with that
authority and within the boundary of reasonable medical practice, to any therapeutic conduct,
including any care, service, or procedure to diagnose, maintain, or treat the physical or mental
condition of the vulnerable adult, or, where permitted under law, to provide nutrition and hydration
parenterally or through intubation; this paragraph does not enlarge or diminish rights otherwise
held under law by:
   (i) a vulnerable adult or a person acting on behalf of a vulnerable adult, including an involved
family member, to consent to or refuse consent for therapeutic conduct; or
   (ii) a caregiver to offer or provide or refuse to offer or provide therapeutic conduct; or
    (2) the vulnerable adult, a person with authority to make health care decisions for the vulnerable
adult, or a caregiver in good faith selects and depends upon spiritual means or prayer for treatment
or care of disease or remedial care of the vulnerable adult in lieu of medical care, provided that this
is consistent with the prior practice or belief of the vulnerable adult or with the expressed intentions
of the vulnerable adult;
   (3) the vulnerable adult, who is not impaired in judgment or capacity by mental or emotional
dysfunction or undue influence, engages in consensual sexual contact with:
    (i) a person including a facility staff person when a consensual sexual personal relationship
existed prior to the caregiving relationship; or
    (ii) a personal care attendant, regardless of whether the consensual sexual personal relationship
existed prior to the caregiving relationship; or
   (4) an individual makes an error in the provision of therapeutic conduct to a vulnerable adult
which does not result in injury or harm which reasonably requires medical or mental health care; or
    (5) an individual makes an error in the provision of therapeutic conduct to a vulnerable adult
that results in injury or harm, which reasonably requires the care of a physician, and:
   (i) the necessary care is provided in a timely fashion as dictated by the condition of the vulnerable
adult;
    (ii) if after receiving care, the health status of the vulnerable adult can be reasonably expected, as
determined by the attending physician, to be restored to the vulnerable adult's preexisting condition;
   (iii) the error is not part of a pattern of errors by the individual;
   (iv) if in a facility, the error is immediately reported as required under section 626.557, and
recorded internally in the facility;
41ST DAY]                            FRIDAY, MARCH 30, 2007                                         1879

   (v) if in a facility, the facility identifies and takes corrective action and implements measures
designed to reduce the risk of further occurrence of this error and similar errors; and
    (vi) if in a facility, the actions required under items (iv) and (v) are sufficiently documented for
review and evaluation by the facility and any applicable licensing, certification, and ombudsman
agency.
   (d) Nothing in this definition requires a caregiver, if regulated, to provide services in excess of
those required by the caregiver's license, certification, registration, or other regulation.
    (e) If the findings of an investigation by a lead agency result in a determination of substantiated
maltreatment for the sole reason that the actions required of a facility under paragraph (c), clause (5),
item (iv), (v), or (vi), were not taken, then the facility is subject to a correction order. An individual
will not be found to have neglected or maltreated the vulnerable adult based solely on the facility's
not having taken the actions required under paragraph (c), clause (5), item (iv), (v), or (vi). This must
not alter the lead agency's determination of mitigating factors under section 626.557, subdivision
9c, paragraph (c).
   Sec. 51. REPEALER.
   (a) Minnesota Statutes 2006, sections 245A.023; 245A.14, subdivisions 7, 9, 9a, 12, and 13; and

   Sec. 2. [124D.332] PREKINDERGARTEN EDUCATION ACT.
    Subdivision 1. Allowance; establishment; purpose. A prekindergarten education allowance
finance system is established to provide choices for families of young children, close the
achievement gap in kindergarten through grade 12 public education, improve learning preparedness,
and promote healthy development and school readiness through quality early care and education
settings.
    Subd. 2. Eligibility; allowance amount. A parent or legal guardian of a child domiciled in this
state who will be at least age three and has not reached the age of five on August 31 is eligible
to receive a prekindergarten education allowance of $200 for each eligible child. In addition, the
prekindergarten education allowance for each eligible child must be increased according to the
following:

    As used in this section, "federal adjusted gross income" means the federal adjusted gross income
as defined in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 of the parent or legal guardian of the
child who has physical custody of the child for more than half the tax year. Federal adjusted gross
income is calculated for the purposes of this section as the tax year beginning two years before the
year in which the eligible parent or legal guardian is notified of the prekindergarten allowance. For
the purposes of this section a custodial parent's adjusted gross income includes the adjusted gross
income of the parent's spouse if the parent is considered to be married for income tax purposes under
section 7703 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
    Subd. 3. Commissioner of education duties. (a) The commissioner of education shall review
the data provided by the Department of Revenue under section 270C.135. By January 31, 2008,
and each subsequent year, the commissioner shall submit the prekindergarten education allowance
to each eligible recipient. The commissioner shall notify the parent or legal guardian of an eligible
child of the amount of the prekindergarten education allowance available. Notification must include
instructions on how to use the allowance to obtain eligible services and a list of approved providers
in the area.
    (b) The commissioner of education must align the data provided by the Department of Revenue
with the applications received according to subdivision 4 to ensure that persons eligible to receive
a prekindergarten education allowance are not counted more than once. In the event that an
eligible recipient is included in the Department of Revenue data and the alternative process under
subdivision 4, the commissioner shall use the data from the Department of Revenue for the
purposes of establishing prekindergarten education allowance eligibility and amount.
    (c) The commissioner shall establish a process to transfer the prekindergarten education
allowance to recipients. The department may utilize technology to transfer the prekindergarten
education allowance through e-mail or other methods to reduce costs. Recipients may not transfer
allowances to another person.
    (d) Each prekindergarten education allowance shall have the monetary value stated for each
eligible child. The prekindergarten allowance may not be used to purchase services until September
1 of the year in which the allowance is issued following its transmission to eligible recipients. In
the event that a recipient moves during the year in which a prekindergarten education allowance
is valid, the recipient may apply to the department to split or divide the prekindergarten education
allowance among two or more providers.
   (e) The commissioner must review and approve work plan amendments from federally
designated Head Start grantees and school district programs that meet the criteria in subdivision 8
and state the methods in which the grantees or programs will expand or enhance services beyond
1886                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [41ST DAY

levels that are funded through specific state or federal appropriations for these purposes.
    Subd. 4. Alternative process. The commissioner of education, in conjunction with the
commissioner of human services, shall establish a method to locate potential recipients who
do not file income taxes and inform them of the availability of the prekindergarten education
allowance. For the purpose of establishing eligibility for the prekindergarten education allowance,
the commissioners of education and human services must accept recipients identified in other
public funding eligibility processes, including, but not limited to, public school programs, Head
Start, and child care assistance programs. In addition, the commissioners of education and human
services must make a sample form available to providers that can be used to determine eligibility
of potential recipients. The commissioner must submit a prekindergarten education allowance to
an eligible recipient who used the alternative processes.
    Subd. 5. Redeeming an allowance. (a) A recipient who has received a prekindergarten education
allowance may transmit the allowance provided in subdivision 3 or subdivision 4 to pay for services
provided to the recipient's eligible dependent child from September 1 of that year through August 31
of the following year in an approved early childhood education and care program or by an approved
early childhood education and care provider as defined in subdivision 8.
    (b) An eligible provider or program that has provided services under subdivision 7 to an
eligible child whose parent or guardian received a prekindergarten education allowance, must
remit the allowance to the Department of Education in a manner determined by the commissioner
of education.
    Subd. 6. Payments to approved programs. The commissioner shall reimburse providers or
programs that received a prekindergarten education allowance from a recipient on behalf of an
eligible three- or four-year-old child on a reimbursement basis for services provided from September
1 to August 31. An eligible provider that accepts prekindergarten education allowance as a form of
payment for services must maintain documentation of services provided and the commissioner must
verify information submitted by eligible providers to ensure appropriate services were provided to
eligible recipients for whom the early childhood allowances were used as a form of payment.
    Subd. 7. Use of allowance. The prekindergarten education allowance may only be used for
services designed to promote school readiness in an approved quality early childhood care and
education setting according to subdivision 8, that are provided to an eligible child who is at least
age three and has not yet reached age five on August 31 of the year in which the allowance is issued.
   Subd. 8. Provider certification. (a) A quality early care and education setting is any service
or program that receives a quality rating from the Department of Human Services under the
Minnesota Early Learning Foundation quality rating system administered by the Department of
Human Services and agrees to accept a prekindergarten education allowance to pay for services.
For allowances issued in 2008 only, a provider may satisfy the quality rating system requirements
and be deemed eligible to participate in this program if the provider has received a provisional
quality rating system approved from either the Department of Education or the Department of
Human Services.
    (b) For the purposes of receiving a provisional quality rating, a child care program or provider
must be approved by the commissioner of human services and a school district or a Head Start
program must be approved by the commissioner of education. Programs and providers must apply
for approval in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioners. To receive approval, the

commissioners must determine that applicants:
   (1) use research-based curricula that are aligned with the education standards, under section
120B.021, instruction and child assessment instruments approved by the Departments of Education
and Human Services, in consultation with the Minnesota Early Learning Foundation;
    (2) provide a program of sufficient intensity and duration to improve the school readiness of
participating children;
    (3) provide opportunities for parent involvement; and
    (4) meet other research-based criteria determined necessary by the commissioners.
   (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), for allowances issued in 2008 only, Head Start programs
meeting Head Start performance standards and accredited child care centers are granted a
provisional quality rating for the purposes of receiving a prekindergarten education allowance
under this section.
    (d) A provider deemed eligible to receive a prekindergarten education allowance under
paragraphs (a) to (c) may use the allowance to enhance services above the current quality levels,
increase the duration of services provided, or expand the number of children to whom services are
provided beyond levels that are funded through specific state or federal appropriations for these
purposes.
    (e) For allowances issued in 2008 and 2009 only, when no quality program is available, a
recipient may direct the prekindergarten education allowance to a provider or program for school
readiness quality improvements that will make the provider or program eligible for a quality rating
according to the quality rating system. Allowable expenditures that will increase the capacity of
the provider or program to help children to be ready for kindergarten include purchase of curricula
and assessment tools, as described in paragraph (b), clause (1), professional development and
training on the area of curricula and assessment tools, purchase of materials to improve the learning
environment, and other expenditures preapproved by the commissioner of human services for child
care providers and the commissioner of education for school district programs.
    Subd. 9. Allowance not income for purposes of other publicly funded programs.
Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the prekindergarten education allowance issued to the
parent or guardian of an eligible child does not count as earned income for purposes of the medical
assistance, MinnesotaCare, MFIP, school readiness, Head Start, or child care assistance programs.

This appropriation is added to the
appropriation in 2007 S.F. No. 1989, article 1,
section 4, and includes amounts for inflation
and to limit tuition increases.
The legislature intends that the Board of
Trustees will not increase tuition more than
three percent in each year of the biennium at
all institutions in the system.
The legislature is concerned that Minnesota's
ranking among the top five states in the nation
with the highest two-year college tuition is
a significant barrier to college access that
will eventually lead to workforce shortages
and economic development challenges. The
Board of Trustees is encouraged to explore
alternative tuition strategies to limit to less
than three percent the tuition increases at
community colleges, technical colleges,
and consolidated community and technical
colleges.

    (d) In lieu of a tax computed according to the rates set forth in this subdivision, the tax of
any individual taxpayer whose taxable net income for the taxable year is less than an amount
determined by the commissioner must be computed in accordance with tables prepared and issued
by the commissioner of revenue based on income brackets of not more than $100. The amount of
tax for each bracket shall be computed at the rates set forth in this subdivision, provided that the
commissioner may disregard a fractional part of a dollar unless it amounts to 50 cents or more, in
which case it may be increased to $1.
    (e) An individual who is not a Minnesota resident for the entire year must compute the
individual's Minnesota income tax as provided in this subdivision. After the application of the
nonrefundable credits provided in this chapter, the tax liability must then be multiplied by a fraction
in which:
    (1) the numerator is the individual's Minnesota source federal adjusted gross income as defined
in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code and increased by the additions required under section
290.01, subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), and (9), and reduced by the Minnesota
assignable portion of the subtraction for United States government interest under section 290.01,
subdivision 19b, clause (1), and the subtractions under section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clauses
(9), (10), (14), (15), and (16), after applying the allocation and assignability provisions of section
290.081, clause (a), or 290.17; and
    (2) the denominator is the individual's federal adjusted gross income as defined in section
62 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, increased by the amounts specified in section 290.01,
subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), and (9), and reduced by the amounts specified in
section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clauses (1), (9), (10), (14), (15), and (16).

    (b) The exemption amount determined under this subdivision is subject to the phase out under
section 55(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, except that alternative minimum taxable income
as determined under this section must be substituted in the computation of the phase out, and the
income threshold used in the phase out must be adjusted for inflation as provided in paragraph (c).
    (c) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006, the exemption amount under paragraph
(a), clause (2), and the income threshold for the phase out under paragraph (b) must be adjusted
for inflation. The commissioner shall make the inflation adjustments in accordance with section
1(f) of the Internal Revenue Code except that for the purposes of this subdivision the percentage
increase must be determined from the year starting September 1, 2005, and ending August 31, 2006,

determination of the commissioner under this subdivision is not a rule under the Administrative
Procedure Act.

Notwithstanding the maximum weight provisions of this section and section 169.85, and in order
to promote the reduction of fuel use and emissions because of engine idling, the maximum gross
vehicle weight limits and the axle weight limits for any motor vehicle subject to sections 169.80
to 169.88 and equipped with idle reduction technology must be increased by the amount of weight
necessary to compensate for the weight of the idle reduction technology, not to exceed 400 pounds.
At the request of an authorized representative of the Department of Transportation or Department
of Public Safety, the vehicle operator shall provide proof that the vehicle is equipped with this
technology through documentation or demonstration.

The amounts added are rounded to the nearest cent for each axle or axle group. The additional cost
does not apply to paragraph (c), clauses (1) and (3).
For a vehicle found to exceed the appropriate maximum permitted weight, a cost-per-mile fee of 22

     "Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 169.06, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Traffic-control signal. (a) Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals
exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in
combination, only the colors Green, Red, and Yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian
signals carrying a word or legend. The traffic-control signal lights or colored lighted arrows
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
     (1) Green indication:
     (i) Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or
left unless a sign at such place prohibits either turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning
right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time this signal is exhibited.
    (ii) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow,
or other movement as permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic
lawfully using the intersection.
    (iii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in subdivision 6,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed
across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. Every driver of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to such pedestrian, except that the pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the green signal indication is first shown.
     (2) Steady yellow indication:
    (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that
the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic must not enter the intersection, except for the continued movement
allowed by any green arrow indication simultaneously exhibited.
    (ii) Pedestrians facing a circular yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control
signal as provided in subdivision 6, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the
roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.

     (3) Steady red indication:
    (i) Vehicular traffic facing a circular red signal alone must stop at a clearly marked stop line

before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown, except

as follows: (A) the driver of a vehicle stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection in obedience
to a red or stop signal, and with the intention of making a right turn may make the right turn, after
stopping, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting such movement, but shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by the signal at that
intersection; or (B) the driver of a vehicle on a one-way street intersecting another one-way street
on which traffic moves to the left shall stop in obedience to a red or stop signal and may then make a
left turn into the one-way street, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting the movement,
but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by
the signal at that intersection.
   (ii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in subdivision 6,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
    (iii) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal, with the intention of making a movement
indicated by the arrow, must stop at a clearly marked stop line but, if none, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and
must remain standing until a permissive signal indication permitting the movement indicated by the
red arrow is displayed, except as follows: when an official sign has been erected permitting a turn
on a red arrow signal, the vehicular traffic facing a red arrow signal indication is permitted to enter
the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street on which
traffic moves to the left, after stopping, but must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other
traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by the signal at that intersection.
    (b) In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this section are applicable except those which can have no application.
Any stop required must be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop
must be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop must be made at the signal.
    (c) When a traffic-control signal indication or indications placed to control a certain movement
or lane are so identified by placing a sign near the indication or indications, no other traffic-control
signal indication or indications within the intersection controls vehicular traffic for that movement
or lane."
