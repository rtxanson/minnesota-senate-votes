appeal.
   Subd. 11. Factors to be considered; extent of order. (a) When deciding whether to issue
an expungement order under this section, the court shall consider and issue a written finding

of the sending state may transport an individual to a receiving agency that provides services pursuant
to a contract under this section and may transport the individual back to the sending state under the
laws of the sending state. Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are granted recognition
and reciprocity in the receiving state for individuals covered by a contract under this section to the
extent that the court orders relate to confinement for treatment or care of mental illness or chemical
dependency. Such treatment or care may address other conditions that may be co-occurring with
the mental illness or chemical dependency. These court orders are not subject to legal challenge in
the courts of the receiving state. Individuals who are detained, committed, or placed under the law
of a sending state and who are transferred to a receiving state under this section continue to be in
the legal custody of the authority responsible for them under the law of the sending state. Except
in emergencies, those individuals may not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a receiving
agency without the specific approval of the authority responsible for them under the law of the
sending state.
    (b) While in the receiving state pursuant to a contract under this section, an individual shall be
subject to the sending state's laws and rules relating to length of confinement, reexaminations, and
extensions of confinement. No individual may be sent to another state pursuant to a contract under
this section until the receiving state has enacted a law recognizing the validity and applicability of

    (c) If an individual receiving services pursuant to a contract under this section leaves the
receiving agency without permission and the individual is subject to involuntary confinement
under the law of the sending state, the receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to return
the individual to the receiving agency. The receiving agency shall immediately report the absence
to the sending agency. The receiving state has the primary responsibility for, and the authority to
direct, the return of these individuals within its borders and is liable for the cost of the action to the
extent that it would be liable for costs of its own resident.
   (d) Responsibility for payment for the cost of care remains with the sending agency.
   (e) This subdivision also applies to county contracts under subdivision 2 which include

    (c) Effective for applications and renewals processed on or after September 1, 2006, general
assistance medical care may be paid for applicants and recipients who meet all eligibility
requirements of paragraph (a), clause (2), item (i), for a temporary period beginning the date of

program; who are enrolled in private health care coverage as defined in section 256B.02,
subdivision 9; who are eligible under paragraph (j); or who receive treatment funded pursuant to
section 254B.02 are exempt from the MinnesotaCare enrollment requirements of this subdivision.
    (f) For applications received on or after October 1, 2003, eligibility may begin no earlier
than the date of application. For individuals eligible under paragraph (a), clause (2), item (i),
a redetermination of eligibility must occur every 12 months. Individuals are eligible under
paragraph (a), clause (2), item (ii), only during inpatient hospitalization but may reapply if there is
a subsequent period of inpatient hospitalization.
    (g) Beginning September 1, 2006, Minnesota health care program applications and renewals
completed by recipients and applicants who are persons described in paragraph (c) and submitted
to the county agency shall be determined for MinnesotaCare eligibility by the county agency.
If all other eligibility requirements of this subdivision are met, eligibility for general assistance
medical care shall be available in any month during which MinnesotaCare enrollment is pending.
Upon notification of eligibility for MinnesotaCare, notice of termination for eligibility for general
assistance medical care shall be sent to an applicant or recipient. If all other eligibility requirements
of this subdivision are met, eligibility for general assistance medical care shall be available until
enrollment in MinnesotaCare subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c), (e), and (f).
    (h) The date of an initial Minnesota health care program application necessary to begin a
determination of eligibility shall be the date the applicant has provided a name, address, and Social
Security number, signed and dated, to the county agency or the Department of Human Services. If
the applicant is unable to provide a name, address, Social Security number, and signature when
health care is delivered due to a medical condition or disability, a health care provider may act on
an applicant's behalf to establish the date of an initial Minnesota health care program application
by providing the county agency or Department of Human Services with provider identification and
a temporary unique identifier for the applicant. The applicant must complete the remainder of the
application and provide necessary verification before eligibility can be determined. The county
agency must assist the applicant in obtaining verification if necessary.
    (i) County agencies are authorized to use all automated databases containing information
regarding recipients' or applicants' income in order to determine eligibility for general assistance
medical care or MinnesotaCare. Such use shall be considered sufficient in order to determine
eligibility and premium payments by the county agency.
    (j) General assistance medical care is not available for a person in a correctional facility unless
the person is detained by law for less than one year in a county correctional or detention facility
as a person accused or convicted of a crime, or admitted as an inpatient to a hospital on a criminal
hold order, and the person is a recipient of general assistance medical care at the time the person is
detained by law or admitted on a criminal hold order and as long as the person continues to meet
other eligibility requirements of this subdivision.
   (k) General assistance medical care is not available for applicants or recipients who do not
cooperate with the county agency to meet the requirements of medical assistance.
    (l) In determining the amount of assets of an individual eligible       under paragraph (a), clause
(2), item (i), there shall be included any asset or interest in an asset,   including an asset excluded
under paragraph (a), that was given away, sold, or disposed of for          less than fair market value
within the 60 months preceding application for general assistance           medical care or during the
22ND DAY]                     WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2007                                        547

period of eligibility. Any transfer described in this paragraph shall be presumed to have been for
the purpose of establishing eligibility for general assistance medical care, unless the individual
furnishes convincing evidence to establish that the transaction was exclusively for another purpose.
For purposes of this paragraph, the value of the asset or interest shall be the fair market value at
the time it was given away, sold, or disposed of, less the amount of compensation received. For
any uncompensated transfer, the number of months of ineligibility, including partial months, shall
be calculated by dividing the uncompensated transfer amount by the average monthly per person
payment made by the medical assistance program to skilled nursing facilities for the previous
calendar year. The individual shall remain ineligible until this fixed period has expired. The period
of ineligibility may exceed 30 months, and a reapplication for benefits after 30 months from the
date of the transfer shall not result in eligibility unless and until the period of ineligibility has
expired. The period of ineligibility begins in the month the transfer was reported to the county
agency, or if the transfer was not reported, the month in which the county agency discovered the
transfer, whichever comes first. For applicants, the period of ineligibility begins on the date of the
first approved application.
    (m) When determining eligibility for any state benefits under this subdivision, the income and
resources of all noncitizens shall be deemed to include their sponsor's income and resources as
defined in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, title IV,
Public Law 104-193, sections 421 and 422, and subsequently set out in federal rules.
     (n) Undocumented noncitizens and nonimmigrants are ineligible for general assistance medical
care. For purposes of this subdivision, a nonimmigrant is an individual in one or more of the classes
listed in United States Code, title 8, section 1101(a)(15), and an undocumented noncitizen is an
individual who resides in the United States without the approval or acquiescence of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
    (o) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a noncitizen who is ineligible for medical
assistance due to the deeming of a sponsor's income and resources, is ineligible for general
assistance medical care.
   (p) Effective July 1, 2003, general assistance medical care emergency services end.
   (q) Effective July 1, 2007, individuals in a correctional facility who have been diagnosed with
a mental illness as defined in section 245.462, subdivision 20, are eligible for general assistance
medical care for three months from the date of release from confinement.

health services; and
    (23) up to six hours of service per client per year for collateral contacts as a component of
children's therapeutic services and support, adult rehabilitative mental health services, or community
mental health services. These services must be directed by an individual treatment plan and are
solely for the purpose of assisting parents and others toward understanding, accommodating, and
better caregiving of the person with mental illness or emotional disturbance.
    (ii) Effective October 1, 2003, for a person who is eligible under subdivision 3, paragraph (a),
clause (2), item (ii), general assistance medical care coverage is limited to inpatient hospital services,
including physician services provided during the inpatient hospital stay. A $1,000 deductible is
required for each inpatient hospitalization.
   (b) Effective August 1, 2005, sex reassignment surgery is not covered under this subdivision.
    (c) In order to contain costs, the commissioner of human services shall select vendors of
medical care who can provide the most economical care consistent with high medical standards
and shall where possible contract with organizations on a prepaid capitation basis to provide these
services. The commissioner shall consider proposals by counties and vendors for prepaid health
plans, competitive bidding programs, block grants, or other vendor payment mechanisms designed
to provide services in an economical manner or to control utilization, with safeguards to ensure that
necessary services are provided. Before implementing prepaid programs in counties with a county
operated or affiliated public teaching hospital or a hospital or clinic operated by the University of
Minnesota, the commissioner shall consider the risks the prepaid program creates for the hospital
and allow the county or hospital the opportunity to participate in the program in a manner that
reflects the risk of adverse selection and the nature of the patients served by the hospital, provided
the terms of participation in the program are competitive with the terms of other participants
considering the nature of the population served. Payment for services provided pursuant to this
subdivision shall be as provided to medical assistance vendors of these services under sections
256B.02, subdivision 8, and 256B.0625. For payments made during fiscal year 1990 and later
years, the commissioner shall consult with an independent actuary in establishing prepayment
rates, but shall retain final control over the rate methodology.
    (d) Recipients eligible under subdivision 3, paragraph (a), shall pay the following co-payments
for services provided on or after October 1, 2003:
   (1) $25 for eyeglasses;
   (2) $25 for nonemergency visits to a hospital-based emergency room;
   (3) $3 per brand-name drug prescription and $1 per generic drug prescription, subject to a $12 per
month maximum for prescription drug co-payments. No co-payments shall apply to antipsychotic
drugs when used for the treatment of mental illness; and
   (4) 50 percent coinsurance on restorative dental services.
    (e) Co-payments shall be limited to one per day per provider for nonpreventive visits, eyeglasses,
and nonemergency visits to a hospital-based emergency room. Recipients of general assistance
medical care are responsible for all co-payments in this subdivision. The general assistance medical
care reimbursement to the provider shall be reduced by the amount of the co-payment, except that
reimbursement for prescription drugs shall not be reduced once a recipient has reached the $12 per

month maximum for prescription drug co-payments. The provider collects the co-payment from
the recipient. Providers may not deny services to recipients who are unable to pay the co-payment,
except as provided in paragraph (f).
   (f) If it is the routine business practice of a provider to refuse service to an individual with
uncollected debt, the provider may include uncollected co-payments under this section. A provider
must give advance notice to a recipient with uncollected debt before services can be denied.
    (g) Any county may, from its own resources, provide medical payments for which state payments
are not made.
    (h) Chemical dependency services that are reimbursed under chapter 254B must not be
reimbursed under general assistance medical care.
   (i) The maximum payment for new vendors enrolled in the general assistance medical care
program after the base year shall be determined from the average usual and customary charge of the
same vendor type enrolled in the base year.
   (j) The conditions of payment for services under this subdivision are the same as the conditions
specified in rules adopted under chapter 256B governing the medical assistance program, unless
otherwise provided by statute or rule.
   (k) Inpatient and outpatient payments shall be reduced by five percent, effective July 1, 2003.
This reduction is in addition to the five percent reduction effective July 1, 2003, and incorporated
by reference in paragraph (i).
   (l) Payments for all other health services except inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy services
shall be reduced by five percent, effective July 1, 2003.
    (m) Payments to managed care plans shall be reduced by five percent for services provided on
or after October 1, 2003.
    (n) A hospital receiving a reduced payment as a result of this section may apply the unpaid
balance toward satisfaction of the hospital's bad debts.
    (o) Fee-for-service payments for nonpreventive visits shall be reduced by $3 for services
provided on or after January 1, 2006. For purposes of this subdivision, a visit means an episode
of service which is required because of a recipient's symptoms, diagnosis, or established illness,
and which is delivered in an ambulatory setting by a physician or physician ancillary, chiropractor,
podiatrist, advance practice nurse, audiologist, optician, or optometrist.
   (p) Payments to managed care plans shall not be increased as a result of the removal of the $3
nonpreventive visit co-payment effective January 1, 2006.
    (q) Payments for mental health services added as covered benefits after December 1, 2007, are
not subject to the reductions in paragraphs (i), (k), (l), and (m).

housing facility.
    (a) The county agency shall pay a monthly allowance for medically prescribed diets if the cost
of those additional dietary needs cannot be met through some other maintenance benefit. The need
for special diets or dietary items must be prescribed by a licensed physician. Costs for special diets
shall be determined as percentages of the allotment for a one-person household under the thrifty
food plan as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture. The types of diets and the
percentages of the thrifty food plan that are covered are as follows:
   (1) high protein diet, at least 80 grams daily, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (2) controlled protein diet, 40 to 60 grams and requires special products, 100 percent of thrifty
food plan;
    (3) controlled protein diet, less than 40 grams and requires special products, 125 percent of
thrifty food plan;
   (4) low cholesterol diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (5) high residue diet, 20 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (6) pregnancy and lactation diet, 35 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (7) gluten-free diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;

   (10) hypoglycemic diet, 15 percent of thrifty food plan; or
   (11) ketogenic diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan.
    (b) Payment for nonrecurring special needs must be allowed for necessary home repairs or
necessary repairs or replacement of household furniture and appliances using the payment standard
of the AFDC program in effect on July 16, 1996, for these expenses, as long as other funding sources
are not available.
    (c) A fee for guardian or conservator service is allowed at a reasonable rate negotiated by the
county or approved by the court. This rate shall not exceed five percent of the assistance unit's gross
monthly income up to a maximum of $100 per month. If the guardian or conservator is a member
of the county agency staff, no fee is allowed.
    (d) The county agency shall continue to pay a monthly allowance of $68 for restaurant meals for
a person who was receiving a restaurant meal allowance on June 1, 1990, and who eats two or more
meals in a restaurant daily. The allowance must continue until the person has not received Minnesota
supplemental aid for one full calendar month or until the person's living arrangement changes and
the person no longer meets the criteria for the restaurant meal allowance, whichever occurs first.
    (e) A fee of ten percent of the recipient's gross income or $25, whichever is less, is allowed
for representative payee services provided by an agency that meets the requirements under SSI
regulations to charge a fee for representative payee services. This special need is available to all
recipients of Minnesota supplemental aid regardless of their living arrangement.

or an adult eligible for the community alternatives for disabled individuals waiver, and who are
shelter needy. An eligible individual who receives this benefit prior to age 65 may continue to receive
the benefit after the age of 65.
    "Shelter needy" means that the assistance unit incurs monthly shelter costs that exceed 40 percent
of the assistance unit's gross income before the application of this special needs standard. "Gross
income" for the purposes of this section is the applicant's or recipient's income as defined in section
256D.35, subdivision 10, or the standard specified in subdivision 3, whichever is greater. A recipient
of a federal or state housing subsidy, that limits shelter costs to a percentage of gross income, shall
not be considered shelter needy for purposes of this paragraph.
     Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256L.03, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

7, with income no greater than 75 percent of the federal poverty guidelines or for families with

care services other than services covered under section 256B.0625, subdivision 9, orthodontic
services, nonemergency medical transportation services, personal care assistant and case

             l Children enrolled in the original children's health plan and children in families with
income equal to or less than 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines, who have other health
insurance, are eligible if the coverage:
    (1) lacks two or more of the following:
    (i) basic hospital insurance;
    (ii) medical-surgical insurance;
    (iii) prescription drug coverage;
    (iv) dental coverage; o

    (v) vision coverage; or
    (vi) mental health coverage;
    (2) requires a deductible of $100 or more per person per year; or
   (3) lacks coverage because the child has exceeded the maximum coverage for a particular
diagnosis or the policy excludes a particular diagnosis.
    The commissioner may change this eligibility criterion for sliding scale premiums in order to
remain within the limits of available appropriations. The requirement of no health coverage does
not apply to newborns.

about the illness, family reactions, and types of treatment and support. Families learn to develop
skills to handle problems posed by mental illness including coping, managing stress, ensuring
safety, creating social support, identifying resources, and supporting treatment and recovery goals.
Services include family counseling, family treatment planning, and family support using cognitive,
behavioral, problem-solving, and communication strategies, and may involve individual, family,
and group intervention activities for consumers and families together, families only, or brief
intermittent consultations at critical times in an episode of care. Eligible providers must be certified

the necessary intensity and frequency of services identified in the individual treatment plan.
Components of intensive mental health outpatient treatment include, but are not limited to:
   (i) individual, family, or multifamily group psychotherapy or psychoeducational services;
    (ii) adjunctive services such as medical monitoring, family psychoeducation, behavioral parent
training, rehabilitative services, medication education, relapse prevention, illness management and
recovery services, and care coordination; and
   (iii) service coordination and referral for medical care or social services.
    During transition into or from services, intensive outpatient treatment under paragraph (a) may
include time-limited services in multiple settings as clinically necessary. The service must be paid
as a per diem based on 90 percent of the rate paid for partial hospitalization. Eligible providers must
be licensed or certified to provide all aspects of the service;
   (3) coordination and care management, which is for the purpose of improving continuity and
access to appropriate and necessary services; and
    (4) collateral contracts as a component of children's therapeutic services and support, adult
rehabilitative mental health services, and community mental health services. These services must
be directed by an individual treatment plan, and are solely for the purpose of assisting parents and
others toward understanding, accommodating, and better caregiving of the person with mental
illness or emotional disturbance.
   (b) The commissioner shall also seek federal approval in order to authorize medical assistance

a legislative session. If the determination is favorable and is received by the commissioner during
the legislative session, the commissioner shall report the information to the legislature within one
week.
   (d) If the federal government approves any of the requests in paragraphs (a) and (b), the
commissioner shall consult with mental health advocates for input when drafting legislation
incorporating the new services into the statutes. The draft legislation is due to the legislature at the
same time as the report in paragraph (c).
