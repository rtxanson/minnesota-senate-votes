    Subd. 6. Standard project financing agreement. The commissioner shall solicit proposals
from private financial institutions and may enter into a standard project financing agreement with
one or more financial institutions. A standard project financing agreement must specify terms and
conditions uniformly available to all participating public entities for financing to implement energy
improvement projects under this section. A local government may choose to finance an energy
improvement project by means other than a standard project financing agreement, but a supplemental
cash flow agreement under subdivision 7 must not be offered unless the commissioner determines
that the other financing means creates no greater potential obligation under a supplemental cash flow
agreement than would be created through a standard project financing agreement.
    Subd. 7. Supplemental cash flow agreement. (a) The commissioner shall offer a supplemental
cash flow agreement for the term of the financing agreement to a participating local government for
qualifying energy improvement projects. A supplemental cash flow agreement is an agreement by
the commissioner to lend money to a local government in an amount necessary so that the cumulative
payments made by the local government under a financing agreement minus the amount loaned by
the commissioner do not exceed the actual energy and operating cost savings attributable to the
8736                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [105TH DAY

energy improvement project for the term of the supplemental cash flow agreement.
Money loaned to a local government by the commissioner in fulfillment of a supplemental cash
flow agreement is repayable only to the extent that a positive budget impact is maintained during
the term of the supplemental cash flow agreement. Terms and conditions of a supplemental cash
flow agreement must be agreed to by contract before a local government enters into a financing
agreement. A supplemental cash flow agreement shall not exceed 15 years from the date of final
completion of the energy improvement project.
   (b) A supplemental cash flow agreement must include, but is not limited to:
   (1) specification of methods and procedures to measure and verify energy cost savings;

operating characteristics of its building or facility in a manner that adversely affects energy cost
savings;
   (4) interest charged on the loan, which may not exceed the interest on the related financial
agreement; and
   (5) procedures for resolution of disputes.
   (c) The commissioner must limit aggregate exposure to liability for payments under existing
supplemental cash flow agreements to an amount no more than the appropriation available to make
those payments.
    Subd. 8. Qualifying energy improvement projects. A local government may submit to
the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, an application for a financing
agreement authorization and supplemental cash flow agreement for energy improvement projects.
The commissioner shall approve an energy improvement project for a supplemental cash flow
agreement and authorize eligibility for a financing agreement if the commissioner determines that:
   (1) the application has been approved by the governing body or agency head of the local
government;
   (2) the project is technically and economically feasible;
   (3) the local government has made adequate provision for the operation and maintenance of the
project;
   (4) the project proposer has fully explored the use of conservation investment plan opportunities
under section 216B.241 with the utilities providing gas and electric service to the project;
    (5) the project has a substantial likelihood of resulting in a positive cash flow in each year the
financing agreement is in effect; and
   (6) adequate money will be available to the commissioner to fulfill the supplemental cash flow
agreement.
   Energy improvement projects under this section are not subject to section 123B.71.

   (c) "Qualified provider" means a person or business experienced in the design, implementation,
and installation of energy conservation measures. A qualified provider to whom the contract is
awarded shall give a sufficient bond to the municipality for its faithful performance.
   Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a municipality may enter into a guaranteed energy
savings contract with a qualified provider to significantly reduce energy or operating costs.
    Before entering into a contract under this subdivision, the municipality shall provide published
notice of the meeting in which it proposes to award the contract, the names of the parties to the
proposed contract, and the contract's purpose.
    Before installation of equipment, modification, or remodeling, the qualified provider shall first
issue a report, summarizing estimates of all costs of installations, modifications, or remodeling,
including costs of design, engineering, installation, maintenance, repairs, or debt service, and
estimates of the amounts by which energy or operating costs will be reduced.
    A guaranteed energy savings contract that includes a written guarantee that savings will meet or
exceed the cost of energy conservation measures is not subject to competitive bidding requirements
of section 471.345 or other law or city charter. The contract is not subject to section 123B.52.
     A municipality may enter into a guaranteed energy savings contract with a qualified provider
if, after review of the report, it finds that the amount it would spend on the energy conservation
measures recommended in the report is not likely to exceed the amount to be saved in energy and
operation costs over 1­5­ 20 years from the date of final installation if the recommendations in the
report were followed, and the qualified provider provides a written guarantee that the energy or
operating cost savings will meet or exceed the costs of the system. The guaranteed energy savings
contract may provide for payments over a period of time, not to exceed ­    15
                                                                             ­ 20 years.

    A municipality entering into a guaranteed energy savings contract shall provide a copy of the
contract and the report from the qualified provider to the commissioner of commerce within 30 days
of the effective date of the contract.
    Guaranteed energy savings contracts may extend beyond the fiscal year in which they become
effective. The municipality shall include in its annual appropriations measure for each later fiscal
year any amounts payable under guaranteed energy savings contracts during the year. Failure of a
municipality to make such an appropriation does not affect the validity of the guaranteed energy
savings contract or the municipality's obligations under the contracts.

subdivision 14. If the individual registers in person and signs by making a mark, the clerk or
election judge accepting the registration shall certify the mark by signing the individual's name. If
the individual registers by mail and signs by making a mark, the mark shall be certified by having

     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 201.061, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Election day registration. (a) An individual who is eligible to vote may register on
election day by appearing in person at the polling place for the precinct in which the individual
maintains residence, by completing a registration application, making an oath in the form prescribed
by the secretary of state and providing proof of residence. An individual may prove residence for
purposes of registering by:
   (1) presenting a driver's license or Minnesota identification card issued pursuant to section
171.07;
     (2) presenting any document approved by the secretary of state as proper identification;
     (3) presenting one of the following:
    (i) a current valid student identification card from a postsecondary educational institution in
Minnesota, if a list of students from that institution has been prepared under section 135A.17 and
certified to the county auditor in the manner provided in rules of the secretary of state; or
   (ii) a current student fee statement that contains the student's valid address in the precinct together
with a picture identification card; or
    (4) having a voter who is registered to vote in the precinct, or who is an employee employed by
and working in a residential facility in the precinct and vouching for a resident in the facility, sign an
oath in the presence of the election judge vouching that the voter or employee personally knows that
the individual is a resident of the precinct. A voter who has been vouched for on election day may
not sign a proof of residence oath vouching for any other individual on that election day. A voter
who is registered to vote in the precinct may sign up to 15 proof-of-residence oaths on any election
day. This limitation does not apply to an employee of a residential facility described in this clause.
The secretary of state shall provide a form for election judges to use in recording the number of
individuals for whom a voter signs proof-of-residence oaths on election day. The form must include
space for the maximum number of individuals for whom a voter may sign proof-of-residence oaths.
For each proof-of-residence oath, the form must include a statement that the voter is registered
to vote in the precinct, personally knows that the individual is a resident of the precinct, and is
making the statement on oath. The form must include a space for the voter's printed name, signature,
telephone number, and address.
      The oath required by this subdivision and Minnesota Rules, part 8200.9939, must be attached
to the voter registration application ­                   an

     The absentee ballot board may begin the process of examining the return envelopes and marking
them "accepted" or "rejected" at any time during the 30 days before the election. If an envelope has
been rejected at least five days before the election, the ballots in the envelope must be considered
spoiled ballots and the official in charge of the absentee ballot board shall provide the voter with a
replacement absentee ballot and return envelope in place of the spoiled ballot. T                ­­ e­­

    Subd. 5. Additional review. (a) If the postelection review in one of the reviewed precincts
reveals a difference greater than one-half of one percent, or greater than two votes in a precinct
where 400 or fewer voters cast ballots, the postelection review official must, within two days,
conduct an additional review of the races indicated in subdivision 3 in at least three precincts in the
same jurisdiction where the discrepancy was discovered. If all precincts in that jurisdiction have
been reviewed, the county auditor must immediately publicly select by lot at least three additional
precincts for review. The postelection review official must complete the additional review within
two days after the precincts are selected and report the results immediately to the county auditor.
If the second review in any of the reviewed precincts also indicates a difference in the vote totals
compiled by the voting system that is greater than one-half of one percent from the result indicated
by the postelection review, or greater than two votes in a precinct where 400 or fewer voters cast
ballots, the county auditor must conduct a review of the ballots from all the remaining precincts in
the county for the races indicated in subdivision 3. This review must be completed no later than six
weeks after the state general election.

    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 201.071, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3. Deficient registration. No voter registration application is deficient if it contains
the voter's name, address, date of birth, current and valid Minnesota driver's license number or
Minnesota state identification number, or if the voter has no current and valid Minnesota driver's
license or Minnesota state identification number, the last four digits of the voter's Social Security
number, if the voter has been issued a Social Security number, prior registration, if any, and

the voter's registration application is deficient or the voter is duly and successfully challenged in
accordance with section 201.195 or 204C.12.
    A voter registration application accepted prior to August 1, 1983, is not deficient for lack
of date of birth. The county or municipality may attempt to obtain the date of birth for a voter
registration application accepted prior to August 1, 1983, by a request to the voter at any time
except at the polling place. Failure by the voter to comply with this request does not make the
registration deficient.
    A voter registration application accepted before January 1, 2004, is not deficient for lack
of a valid Minnesota driver's license or state identification number or the last four digits of a
Social Security number. A voter registration application submitted by a voter who does not have
a Minnesota driver's license or state identification number, or a Social Security number, is not
deficient for lack of any of these numbers.

    Sec. 16. [161.3203] CONTRACTS FOR WORK FOR TRUNK HIGHWAY.
    Subdivision 1. Privatization transportation contracts. For purposes of this section,
"privatization transportation contract" means an enforceable agreement, or combination or series
of agreements, by which a private contractor agrees with the commissioner of transportation to
provide work (1) that is incidental to the construction or improvement of trunk highways, or (2)
for maintenance of trunk highways. A privatization transportation contract does not include a
design-build contract as defined in section 161.3410, subdivision 3, contracts awarded pursuant to
section 161.32, work related to utility relocation, utility relocation agreements, state aid agreements,
municipal agreements, interagency agreements, joint powers agreements, partnership agreements,
and grant agreements. Privatization transportation contracts also do not include contracts related
to aerial photos, asbestos investigation or abatement, communications, computer and information
technology, construction contract administration, cultural resource investigations, electronic
communications, environmental investigations, expert witnesses, contaminated soil investigations
and remediation, geographic information systems, hydraulic and geotechnical studies, intelligent
transportation systems, management support, mapping and photogrammetrics, market research,
medical analysis, planning, public relations, right-of-way appraisals or acquisitions and field title
investigations, research, relocation services, special studies, traffic studies and modeling, and
employee training, and does not include services by persons licensed under sections 326.02 to
326.15.
    Subd. 2. Applicability. This section applies to privatization transportation contracts in a total
amount greater than $100,000. The requirements imposed by this section are in addition to, and do
not supersede, the requirements of any other applicable section of law.
   Subd. 3. Review of contract costs. (a) Before entering into a privatization transportation
contract, the commissioner of transportation shall prepare a comprehensive written estimate of the
cost of having the same work provided in the most cost-effective manner by agency employees.
The cost estimate must include all costs of having agency employees provide the work, including
105TH DAY]                             MONDAY, APRIL 21, 2008                                     8793

the cost of pension, insurance, and other employee benefits. The cost estimate is nonpublic data,
as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 9, until the day after the deadline for receipt of responses
under paragraph (b), when it becomes public data.
    (b) After soliciting and receiving responses, the commissioner shall publicly designate the
responder to which it proposes to award the privatization contract. The commissioner shall prepare
a comprehensive written estimate of the cost of the proposal based on the designated responder's
bid, including the cost of a transition from public to private provision of the work, any additional
unemployment and retirement benefits resulting from the transfer, and costs associated with
monitoring the proposed contract. If the designated responder proposes to perform any or all of
the desired services outside the state, the commissioner of transportation shall include in the cost
estimate, as nearly as possible, any loss of sales and income tax revenue to the state. The cost
estimate must not include trade secret data which is classified as nonpublic data under section
13.37, subdivision 2.
   (c) Before entering into a privatization transportation contract for $250,000 or more, the
commissioner shall determine that:
       (1) the cost estimated under paragraph (b) will be lower than the cost estimated under paragraph
(a);
    (2) the quality of the work to be provided by the designated responder is likely to equal or exceed
the quality of services that could be provided by Department of Transportation employees;
    (3) the contract, together with other privatization transportation contracts to which the
department is or has been party, will not reduce full-time equivalent positions within the department
or result in layoffs; and
       (4) the proposed privatization contract is in the public interest.
    Subd. 4. Reports. Beginning in 2009, the commissioner shall provide, no later than September
1, an annual written report to the legislature, in compliance with sections 3.195 and 3.197, and
shall submit the report to the chairs of the senate and house of representatives committees having
jurisdiction over transportation. The report must list all privatization transportation contracts within
the meaning of this section that were executed or performed, whether wholly or in part, in the
previous fiscal year. The report must identify, with respect to each contract: the contractor; contract
amount; duration; work, provided or to be provided; the comprehensive estimate derived under
subdivision 3, paragraph (a); the comprehensive estimate derived under subdivision 3, paragraph
(b); the actual cost to the agency of the contractor's performance of the contract; and for contracts
of at least $250,000, a statement containing the commissioner's determinations under subdivision
3, paragraph (c).

highway funds for transportation research including public and private research partnerships.
The commissioner shall spend this money for (1) research to improve the design, construction,
maintenance, management, and environmental compatibility of transportation systems; (2) research
on transportation policies that enhance energy efficiency and economic development; (3) programs
for implementing and monitoring research results; and (4) development of transportation education
and outreach activities. Of all funds appropriated to the commissioner other than state-aid funds,
the commissioner shall spend at least 0.1 percent, but not exceeding ­ $8

    Subdivision 1. Standards generally. Each bridge, including a privately owned bridge, must
conform to the strength, width, clearance, and safety standards imposed by the commissioner for the
connecting highway or street. This subdivision applies to a bridge that is constructed after August
1, 1989, on any public highway or street. The bridge must have sufficient strength to support with
safety the maximum vehicle weights allowed under sections 169.822 to 169.829 and must have the
minimum width specified in section 165.04, subdivision 3.
    Subd. 1a. Inspection. (a) Each bridge must be inspected annually, unless a longer interval not
to exceed two years for bridges or four years for bridges classified as culverts is authorized by
the commissioner. The commissioner's authorization must be based on factors including, but not
limited to, the age and condition of the bridge, the rate of deterioration of the bridge, the type of
structure, the susceptibility of the bridge to failure, and the characteristics of traffic on the bridge.
The commissioner may require interim inspections at intervals of less than one year on bridges that
are posted, bridges subjected to extreme scour conditions, bridges subject to significant substructure
movement or settlement, and for other reasons as specified or inferred in the AASHTO manual.
    (b) The thoroughness of each inspection depends on such factors as age, traffic characteristics,
state of maintenance, and known deficiencies. The evaluation of these factors is the responsibility
of the engineer assigned the responsibility for inspection as defined by rule adopted by the
commissioner of transportation.
    Subd. 2. Inspection and inventory responsibilities; rules; forms. (a) The commissioner of
transportation shall adopt official inventory and bridge inspection report forms for use in making
bridge inspections by the owners or highway authorities specified by this subdivision. B      ­­r­d

inventory by rules. The owner or highway authority shall inspect and inventory in accordance with
these standards and furnish the commissioner with such data as may be necessary to maintain a
central inventory.

A person shall immediately apply for a salvage certificate of title if the person acquires a damaged
late-model or high-value motor vehicle with an out-of-state title and the vehicle:
    (1) is a vehicle that was acquired by an insurer through payment of damages;
    (2) is a vehicle for which the cost of repairs exceeds the value of the damaged vehicle; or
    (3) has an out-of-state salvage certificate of title as proof of ownership.
    (c) A self-insured owner of a late-model or high-value vehicle who sustains damage by collision
or other occurrence which exceeds 70 percent of its actual cash value shall immediately apply for a
salvage certificate of title. Damage, for the purpose of this calculation, does not include the actual
cost incurred to repair, replace, or reinstall inflatable safety restraints and other vehicle components
that must be replaced due to the deployment of the inflatable safety restraints.

      Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 169.041, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

105TH DAY]                             MONDAY, APRIL 21, 2008                                                8805

to the parking citation, a written towing report describing the motor vehicle and the reasons for
towing. The report must be signed by the officer and the tow driver. Within the Department of
Transportation's eight-county metropolitan district, an authorized employee of the department's
freeway service patrol may order a tow from a trunk highway after preparing a written towing
report provided by the Minnesota State Patrol. A citation need not be issued before the employee
orders a tow.
    Except in cases where an accident or traffic hazard to the traveling public exists, the department
employee shall ensure that if the tower requested to remove the vehicle by the owner arrives before
the tower requested by the department, the tower requested by the owner is given the opportunity
to actually conduct and complete all towing operations requested.
   Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 169.06, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Traffic-control signal. (a) Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals
exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in
combination, only the colors Green, Red, and Yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian
signals carrying a word or legend. The traffic-control signal lights or colored lighted arrows
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
   (1) Green indication:
     (i) Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or
left unless a sign at such place prohibits either turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning
right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time this signal is exhibited.
    (ii) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow,
or other movement as permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic
lawfully using the intersection.
    (iii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in subdivision 6,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed
across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. Every driver of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to such pedestrian, except that the pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the green signal indication is first shown.
   (2) Steady yellow indication:
    (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that
the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic must not enter the intersection, except for the continued movement
allowed by any green arrow indication simultaneously exhibited.
    (ii) Pedestrians facing a circular yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control
signal as provided in subdivision 6, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the
roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.

    (3) Steady red indication:
     (i) Vehicular traffic facing a circular red signal alone must stop at a clearly marked stop line
but, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then
before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown, except
as follows: (A) the driver of a vehicle stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection in obedience
to a red or stop signal, and with the intention of making a right turn may make the right turn, after
stopping, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting such movement, but shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by the signal at that
intersection; or (B) the driver of a vehicle on a one-way street intersecting another one-way street
on which traffic moves to the left shall stop in obedience to a red or stop signal and may then make a
left turn into the one-way street, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting the movement,
but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by
the signal at that intersection.
   (ii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in subdivision 6,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
    (iii) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal, with the intention of making a movement
indicated by the arrow, must stop at a clearly marked stop line but, if none, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and
must remain standing until a permissive signal indication permitting the movement indicated by the
red arrow is displayed, except as follows: when an official sign has been erected permitting a turn
on a red arrow signal, the vehicular traffic facing a red arrow signal indication is permitted to enter
the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street on which
traffic moves to the left, after stopping, but must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other
traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by the signal at that intersection.
    (b) In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this section are applicable except those which can have no application.
Any stop required must be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop
must be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop must be made at the signal.
    (c) When a traffic-control signal indication or indications placed to control a certain movement
or lane are so identified by placing a sign near the indication or indications, no other traffic-control
signal indication or indications within the intersection controls vehicular traffic for that movement
or lane.

    (f) The commissioner, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, may suspend a certificate
issued under paragraph (b) for failure to meet annual certification requirements prescribed by
the commissioner or failure to inspect commercial motor vehicles in accordance with inspection
procedures established by the State Patrol. The commissioner shall revoke a certificate issued
under paragraph (b) if the commissioner determines after notice and an opportunity for a hearing
that the certified person issued an inspection decal for a commercial motor vehicle when the person
knew or reasonably should have known that the vehicle was in such a state of repair that it would
have been declared out of service if inspected by an employee of the State Patrol. Suspension and
revocation of certificates under this subdivision are not subject to sections 14.57 to 14.69.

Transportation carrier number issued to the owner of the vehicle, or to the operator of the vehicle if
other than the owner;
    (3) the vehicle identification number and, if applicable, the license plate number of the vehicle;
    (4) the date and location of the inspection;
    (5) the vehicle components inspected and a description of the findings of the inspection,
including identification of the components not in compliance with federal motor carrier safety
regulations; and

   (6) the inspector's certification that the inspection was complete, accurate, and in compliance
with the requirements of this section.
    (b) The owner must retain a copy of the inspection report for at least 14 months at a location in
the state where the vehicle is domiciled or maintained. The inspector must maintain a copy of the
inspection report for a period of 14 months following the inspection in a location in the state where
the inspector conducts business. During this period the report must be available for inspection by
an authorized federal, state, or local official.
    (c) The commissioner shall prescribe the form of the inspection report and revise it as necessary
to comply with state and federal law and regulations. The adoption of the report form is not subject
to the Administrative Procedure Act.
    Subd. 5. Inspection decal. ­(­

than $2 for each decal, to persons certified to perform inspections under subdivision 3, paragraph
(b). Decals are issued to inspectors by serial number and are not transferable unless approved by
the commissioner.

the commissioner shall issue the certificate to the applicant. This subdivision only applies to
Minnesota-licensed vehicles that are not housed or maintained in Minnesota.
    Subd. 10. Exemption. This section does not apply to a vehicle operated by a motor carrier of
passengers, as defined in section 221.011, subdivision 48, if the vehicle has been inspected under
section 221.0252, subdivision 3, paragraph (a), clause (2), within the previous 12 months.
    Sec. 47. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 169.782, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Driver; daily inspection report. (a) The driver of a commercial motor vehicle
shall report in writing at the completion of each day's work on each commercial motor vehicle
the driver has operated. A person who owns one or more commercial motor vehicles and who
employs drivers for those commercial motor vehicles must require each driver to submit a written
report as required ­n
                   i­ by this section. The report must cover the following parts and accessories:
service brakes, including trailer and semitrailer brake connections; parking (hand) brake; steering
mechanism; lighting devices and reflectors; tires; horn; windshield wiper or wipers; rear vision
mirror or mirrors; coupling devices; wheels and rims; and emergency equipment.
    (b) The report must identify the vehicle and list any defect or deficiency discovered by or reported
to the driver that would affect the safe operation of the vehicle or result in its mechanical breakdown.
If no defect or deficiency is discovered by or reported to the driver, the report must so indicate. The
driver must sign the report after completing it. In the case of a commercial motor vehicle operated by
two drivers, the signature of one of the drivers satisfies the requirements of this subdivision if both
drivers agree concerning the defects or deficiencies. If a driver operates more than one commercial
motor vehicle during a day's work, a report must be prepared for each vehicle operated.
    (c) Before operating or allowing the operation of a commercial motor vehicle on which a report
has been prepared under this subdivision, the owner of the vehicle or the owner's agent must repair
defects or deficiencies listed on the report that would ­             b­ ­

load, but excluding non-cargo-carrying equipment, such as refrigeration units or air compressors,
necessary for safe and efficient operation and located on the end of the semitrailer adjacent to the
truck-tractor. However, statewide, a single semitrailer may exceed 48 feet, but not 53 feet, if the
distance from the kingpin to the centerline of the rear axle group of the semitrailer does not exceed
43 feet.
    (c) Statewide, no single trailer may have an overall length exceeding 45 feet, including the tow
bar assembly but exclusive of rear bumpers that do not increase the overall length by more than six
inches.
   (d) For determining compliance with this subdivision, the length of the semitrailer or trailer must
be determined separately from the overall length of the combination of vehicles.
   (e) No semitrailer or trailer used in a three-vehicle combination may have an overall length in

The amounts added are rounded to the nearest cent for each axle or axle group. The additional cost
does not apply to paragraph (c), clauses (1) and (3).
For a vehicle found to exceed the appropriate maximum permitted weight, a cost-per-mile fee of 22
cents per ton, or fraction of a ton, over the permitted maximum weight is imposed in addition to the
normal permit fee. Miles must be calculated based on the distance already traveled in the state plus
the distance from the point of detection to a transportation loading site or unloading site within the
state or to the point of exit from the state.
   (f) As an alternative to paragraph (e), an annual permit may be issued for overweight, or oversize
and overweight, construction equipment, machinery, and supplies. The fees for the permit are as

   Subdivision 1. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply.
    (a) "Life-cycle cost" is the sum of the cost of the initial pavement project and all anticipated costs
for maintenance, repair, and resurfacing over the life of the pavement. Anticipated costs must be
based on Minnesota's actual or reasonably projected maintenance, repair, and resurfacing schedules,
and costs determined by the Department of Transportation district personnel based upon recently
awarded local projects and experience with local material costs.
   (b) "Life-cycle cost analysis" is a comparison of life-cycle costs among competing paving
materials using equal design lives and equal comparison periods.
    Subd. 2. Required analysis. For each project in the reconditioning, resurfacing, and road repair
funding categories, the commissioner shall perform a life-cycle cost analysis and shall document
the lowest life-cycle costs and all alternatives considered. The commissioner shall document the
chosen pavement strategy and, if the lowest life cycle is not selected, document the justification for
the chosen strategy. A life-cycle cost analysis is required for projects to be constructed after July 1,
2011. For projects to be constructed prior to July 1, 2011, when feasible, the department will use its
best efforts to perform life-cycle cost analyses.

members of the senate and house of representatives committees with jurisdiction over transportation
finance beginning on January 1, 2012, the results of the analyses required in subdivision 2.

(a) The commissioner shall inspect or provide for the inspection of vehicles at least annually. In
addition to scheduled annual inspections and reinspections scheduled for the purpose of verifying
that deficiencies have been corrected, unannounced inspections of any vehicle may be conducted.
    (b) On determining that a vehicle or vehicle equipment is in a condition that is likely to cause
an accident or breakdown, the commissioner shall require the vehicle to be taken out of service
immediately. The commissioner shall require that vehicles and equipment not meeting standards
be repaired and brought into conformance with the standards and shall require written evidence of
compliance from the operator before allowing the operator to return the vehicle to service.
   (c) The commissioner shall provide in the rules procedures for inspecting vehicles, removing
unsafe vehicles from service, determining and requiring compliance, and reviewing driver
qualifications.
    (d) The commissioner shall design a distinctive decal to be issued to special transportation
service providers with a current certificate of compliance under this section. A decal is valid for one
year from the last day of the month in which it is issued. A person who is subject to the operating
standards adopted under this section may not provide special transportation service in a vehicle that
does not conspicuously display a decal issued by the commissioner.
    (e) Special transportation service providers shall prominently display in each vehicle all contact
information for the submission of complaints regarding the transportation services provided to that
individual. All vehicles providing service under section 473.386 shall display contact information
for the Metropolitan Council. All other special transportation service vehicles shall display contact
information for the commissioner of transportation.

    (a) The commissioner of transportation shall establish a position of state rail safety inspector
in the Office of Freight and Commercial Vehicle Operations of the Minnesota Department of

Code, title 49, sections 20103, 20105, 20106, and 20113, and Code of Federal Regulations, title 49,
part 212. The state rail safety inspector shall inspect mainline track, secondary track, and yard and
industry track; inspect railroad right-of-way, including adjacent or intersecting drainage, culverts,
bridges, overhead structures, and traffic and other public crossings; inspect yards and physical
plants; review and enforce safety requirements; review maintenance and repair records; and review
railroad security measures. To the extent delegated by the commissioner, the inspector may issue
citations for violations of this chapter, or to ensure railroad employee and public safety and welfare.
    (b) The commissioner shall annually assess railroad companies that are (1) defined as common
carriers under section 218.011, (2) classified by federal law or regulation as Class I Railroads or Class
I Rail Carriers, and (3) operating in this state, by a division of equal proportion between carriers,
assessed in equal amounts for 365 days of the calendar year. The commissioner shall assess all

    (c) The commissioner may exempt a common carrier not federally classified as Class I from
violations for a period of up to two years if the common carrier applies for participation in a work
site safety coaching program, such as the "MNSharp" program administered by the Minnesota
Department of Labor and Industry, and the commissioner determines such participation to be
preferred enforcement for safety or security violations.
    (d) Any person aggrieved by an assessment levied under this section may appeal within 90 days
any assessment, violation, or administrative penalty to the Office of Administrative Hearings, with
further appeal and review by the district court.

     Sec. 97. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 473.386, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Service contracts; management; transportation accessibility advisory committee.
(a) The council may contract for services necessary for the provision of special transportation.
Transportation service provided under a contract must specify the service to be provided, the
standards that must be met, and the rates for operating and providing special transportation services.
    (b) The council shall establish management policies for the service and may contract with a
service administrator for day-to-day administration and management of the service. Any contract
must delegate to the service administrator clear authority to administer and manage the delivery
of the service pursuant to council management policies and must establish performance and
compliance standards for the service administrator. The council may provide directly day to day
administration and management of the service and may own or lease vehicles used to provide the
service.
   (c) The council shall ensure that the service administrator establishes a system for registering
and expeditiously responding to complaints by users, informing users of how to register complaints,
and requiring providers to report on incidents that impair the safety and well-being of users or the
quality of the service.

subdivision 2.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
     Sec. 100. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 473.399, is amended to read:

           N-- IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA.
    Subdivision 1. General requirements. (a) The council must identify in its transportation
policy plan those heavily traveled corridors where development of a transit way may be feasible
and cost-effective. Modes of providing service in a transit way may include bus rapid transit, light
rail transit, commuter rail, or other available systems or technologies that improve transit service.
    (b) After the completion of environmental studies and receipt of input from the governing body
of each statutory and home rule charter city, county, and town in which a transit way is proposed to
be constructed, the council must designate the locally preferred alternative transit mode with respect
to the corridor.
     (c) The council shall ­       ad­o­­

     Sec. 102. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 473.3993, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Final design plan. "Final design plan" means a light rail transit plan that includes the
items in the preliminary design plan and the preliminary engineering plan for the facilities proposed
but with greater detail and specificity needed for construction. The final design plan must include,
at a minimum:
    (1) final plans for the physical design of facilities, including the right-of-way definition;
environmental impacts and mitigation measures; intermodal coordination with bus operations and
routes; and civil engineering plans for vehicles, track, stations, parking, and access, including
disability access; and
    (2) final plans for civil engineering for electrification, communication, and other similar
facilities; operational rules, procedures, and strategies; capital costs; ridership; operating costs and
revenues, and sources of funds for operating subsidies; financing for construction and operation;
an implementation method; and other similar matters.
    The final design plan must be stated with sufficient particularity and detail to allow the proposer
to begin the acquisition and construction of operable facilities. If a design-build implementation

construction for light rail transit, the requirements and procedures in sections 161.3410 to 161.3426
apply to the procurement, subject to the following conditions and exceptions:
    (1) if the Metropolitan Council is the responsible authority for a particular light rail transit
project, when used in sections 161.3410 to 161.3426, (i) the terms "commissioner," "Minnesota
Department of Transportation," "department," "state agencies," and "road authority" refer to
the Metropolitan Council, and (ii) the term "state" refers to the Metropolitan Council except in
references to state law or in references to the state as a geographical location;
   (2) the provisions of section 161.3412, subdivisions 3 and 4, are not applicable to the
procurement; and
   (3) if any federal funds are used in developing or constructing the light rail transit project, any
provisions in sections 161.3410 to 161.3426 that are inconsistent with, or prohibited by, any federal
law, regulation, or other requirement are not applicable to the procurement.

bridges, and transit;
   (3) comparison of estimates of revenues raised by current transportation funding sources, with
long-term needs of the state's transportation system;
    (4) identification of options for maintenance and improvement of the state's transportation
system with specific reference to the effects of potential increases in vehicle fuel economy,
availability of alternative modes of transportation, and extreme fuel price volatility on future
transportation revenues;
    (5) analysis of alternative pricing options utilized in other states and countries, and their potential
for use, public acceptance, alleviation of congestion, and revenue generation in this state; and
    (6) identification of options for road-use pricing, other alternative financing mechanisms with
particular consideration of key environmental impacts such as air quality, water quality, and
greenhouse gas emissions, and estimates of implementation costs, user costs, and revenue.
  (c) The commissioner shall report the results of the study to the legislature no later than
November 1, 2009.

right-of-way affected by the interest;
   (3) the affected road was the only means of access to a property;
   (4) the extinguishment took place within the last ten years; and
    (5) a person whose only access to property was lost because of the extinguishment files a petition
of a nullification with the town board stating that the person's property became landlocked because
of the extinguishment and that the road satisfies all of the requirements of paragraph (a), clauses (1)
to (4). A copy of the road order found filed or recorded with the county auditor must be attached to
the petition. The town shall file the petition with the county auditor and record it with the county
recorder.

    (1) it is at least 20 years old;
    (2) its first owner following its manufacture was a branch of the armed forces of the United
States and it presently conforms to the vehicle specifications required during the time of military

   (3) it is owned by a nonprofit organization and operated solely as a collector's vehicle. For
purposes of this subdivision, "nonprofit organization" means a corporation, society, association,
foundation, or institution organized and operated exclusively for historical or educational purposes,
no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of a private individual.
    (b) The owner of the vehicle shall execute an affidavit stating the name and address of the
person from whom purchased and of the new owner; the make, year, and model number of
the motor vehicle; the manufacturer's identification number; and the collector military vehicle
identification number, if any, located on the exterior of the vehicle. The affidavit must affirm
that the vehicle is owned by a nonprofit organization and is operated solely as a collector's item

to comply with this subdivision.
    (c) Notwithstanding section 168.09, 168.12, or other law to the contrary, the owner of a registered
collector military vehicle is not required to display registration plates on the exterior of the vehicle if
the vehicle has an exterior number identification that conforms to the identifying system for military
vehicles in effect when the vehicle was last owned by the branch of the armed forces of the United
States or in effect in the year to which the collector military vehicle has been restored. However, the
state registration plates must be carried in or on the collector military vehicle at all times.

state name and an assigned vehicle registration number. The number assigned by the commissioner
may be a combination of a letter or sign with figures. The color of the plates and the color of
the abbreviation of the state name and the number assigned must be in marked contrast. The
plates must be lettered, spaced, or distinguished to suitably indicate the registration of the vehicle
