   The payment made to a claimant shall be the amount of the state refund calculated under this
subdivision. No payment is allowed if the claimant's household income is $77,520 or more.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective beginning with refunds based on property taxes
payable in 2009.
   Sec. 2. TAXPAYER ASSISTANCE SERVICES; PROPERTY TAX REFUND.
    (a) $100,000 in fiscal year 2009 is appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of
revenue to make grants to one or more nonprofit organizations, qualifying under section 501(c)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to coordinate, facilitate, encourage, and aid in the provision
of taxpayer assistance services. The commissioner must award grants under this section so as to
increase the availability of taxpayer assistance services after April 15, to assist homeowners in filing
claims for the property tax refund, and to increase participation in the program. This appropriation
is onetime and is not added to the agency's base budget.
    (b) "Taxpayer assistance services" means accounting and tax preparation services provided by
volunteers to low-income and disadvantaged Minnesota residents to help them file federal and state
income tax returns, Minnesota property tax refund claims, and may include provision of personal
representation before the Department of Revenue and Internal Revenue Service.

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 477A.011, subdivision 34, is amended to read:
    Subd. 34. City revenue need. (a) For a city with a population equal to or greater than 2,500,
"city revenue need" is the sum of (1) 5.0734098 times the pre-1940 housing percentage; plus (2)
19.141678 times the population decline percentage; plus (3) 2504.06334 times the road accidents
factor; plus (4) 355.0547; minus (5) the metropolitan area factor; minus (6) 49.10638 times the
household size.
    (b) For a city with a population less than 2,500, "city revenue need" is the sum of (1) 2.387 times
the pre-1940 housing percentage; plus (2) 2.67591 times the commercial industrial percentage;

plus (3) 3.16042 times the population decline percentage; plus (4) 1.206 times the transformed
population; minus (5) 62.772.
    (c) For a city with a population of 2,500 or more and a population in one of the most recently
available five years that was less than 2,500, "city revenue need" is the sum of (1) its city revenue
need calculated under paragraph (a) multiplied by its transition factor; plus (2) its city revenue
need calculated under the formula in paragraph (b) multiplied by the difference between one and its
transition factor. For purposes of this paragraph, a city's "transition factor" is equal to 0.2 multiplied
by the number of years that the city's population estimate has been 2,500 or more. This provision
only applies for aids payable in calendar years 2006 to 2008 to cities with a 2002 population of

calendar year as the employment data. The commissioner of the Department of Employment and
Economic Development shall certify to the city the average annual number of employees for each
city by June 1, 2008. A city may challenge an estimate under this paragraph by filing its specific
objection, including the names of employers that it feels may have misreported data, in writing

For aids payable in 2009 only, the total aid for a city with a population less than 2,500 must not be
less than what it received under this section in the previous year unless its total aid in calendar year
2008 was aid under section 477A.011, subdivision 36, paragraph (s), in which case its minimum aid
is zero.
    (e) A city's aid loss under this section may not exceed $300,000 in any year in which the total city
aid appropriation under section 477A.03, subdivision 2a, is equal or greater than the appropriation
under that subdivision in the previous year, unless the city has an adjustment in its city net tax
capacity under the process described in section 469.174, subdivision 28.
    (f) If a city's net tax capacity used in calculating aid under this section has decreased in any year
by more than 25 percent from its net tax capacity in the previous year due to property becoming
tax-exempt Indian land, the city's maximum allowed aid increase under paragraph (c) shall be
increased by an amount equal to (1) the city's tax rate in the year of the aid calculation, multiplied
by (2) the amount of its net tax capacity decrease resulting from the property becoming tax exempt.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for aids payable in calendar year 2009 and
thereafter, provided that the appropriation increase for aids payable in 2009 under section 477A.03,

commissioner of revenue under section 275.74, subdivision 2;
    (8) pay amounts required to correct an error in the levy certified to the county auditor by a city

    (17) to pay for the maintenance and support of a city or county society for the prevention of
cruelty to animals under section 343.11. If the city or county uses this special levy, any amount
levied by the city or county in the previous levy year for the purposes specified in this clause and
included in the city's or county's previous year's levy limit computed under section 275.71, must be
deducted from the levy limit base under section 275.71, subdivision 2, in determining the city's or

governmental unit did not use this special levy in the previous year its levy limit base under section
275.71 shall be reduced by the amount equal to the amount it levied for the purposes specified in
this clause in the previous year; and
    (22) an amount equal to any reductions in the certified aids or credits payable under sections
477A.011 to 477A.014, and section 273.1384, due to unallotment under section 16A.152. The
amount of the levy allowed under this clause is equal to the amount unallotted in the calendar year
in which the tax is levied unless the unallotment amount is not known by September 1 of the levy
year, in which case the unallotment amount may be levied in the following year.

      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 289A.19, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7. Federal extensions. When an extension of time to file a partnership or S corporation

in determining the sales factor.
    (a) The sales factor includes all sales, gross earnings, or receipts received in the ordinary course
of the business, except that the following types of income are not included in the sales factor:
   (1) interest;
   (2) dividends;
   (3) sales of capital assets as defined in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;

sales of stock; and
    (6) royalties, fees, or other like income of a type which qualify for a subtraction from federal
taxable income under section 290.01, subdivision 19d(10).
   (b) Sales of tangible personal property are made within this state if the property is received by a
purchaser at a point within this state, and the taxpayer is taxable in this state, regardless of the f.o.b.
point, other conditions of the sale, or the ultimate destination of the property.
    (c) Tangible personal property delivered to a common or contract carrier or foreign vessel for
delivery to a purchaser in another state or nation is a sale in that state or nation, regardless of f.o.b.
point or other conditions of the sale.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c), when intoxicating liquor, wine, fermented malt
beverages, cigarettes, or tobacco products are sold to a purchaser who is licensed by a state or
political subdivision to resell this property only within the state of ultimate destination, the sale is
made in that state.
   (e) Sales made by or through a corporation that is qualified as a domestic international sales
corporation under section 992 of the Internal Revenue Code are not considered to have been made
within this state.
    (f) Sales, rents, royalties, and other income in connection with real property is attributed to the
state in which the property is located.
    (g) Receipts from the lease or rental of tangible personal property, including finance leases and
true leases, must be attributed to this state if the property is located in this state and to other states
if the property is not located in this state. Receipts from the lease or rental of moving property
including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, rolling stock, aircraft, vessels, or mobile equipment
are included in the numerator of the receipts factor to the extent that the property is used in this state.
The extent of the use of moving property is determined as follows:
   (1) A motor vehicle is used wholly in the state in which it is registered.
    (2) The extent that rolling stock is used in this state is determined by multiplying the receipts
from the lease or rental of the rolling stock by a fraction, the numerator of which is the miles traveled
within this state by the leased or rented rolling stock and the denominator of which is the total miles
traveled by the leased or rented rolling stock.
    (3) The extent that an aircraft is used in this state is determined by multiplying the receipts from
the lease or rental of the aircraft by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of landings of
the aircraft in this state and the denominator of which is the total number of landings of the aircraft.
    (4) The extent that a vessel, mobile equipment, or other mobile property is used in the state is
determined by multiplying the receipts from the lease or rental of the property by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days during the taxable year the property was in this state and
the denominator of which is the total days in the taxable year.
    (h) Royalties and other income not described in paragraph (a), clause (6), received for the use
of or for the privilege of using intangible property, including patents, know-how, formulas, designs,
processes, patterns, copyrights, trade names, service names, franchises, licenses, contracts, customer

lists, or similar items, must be attributed to the state in which the property is used by the purchaser.
If the property is used in more than one state, the royalties or other income must be apportioned
to this state pro rata according to the portion of use in this state. If the portion of use in this state
cannot be determined, the royalties or other income must be excluded from both the numerator and
the denominator. Intangible property is used in this state if the purchaser uses the intangible property
or the rights therein in the regular course of its business operations in this state, regardless of the
location of the purchaser's customers.
    (i) Sales of intangible property are made within the state in which the property is used by the
purchaser. If the property is used in more than one state, the sales must be apportioned to this state
pro rata according to the portion of use in this state. If the portion of use in this state cannot be
determined, the sale must be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator of the sales
factor. Intangible property is used in this state if the purchaser used the intangible property in the
regular course of its business operations in this state.
    (j) Receipts from the performance of services must be attributed to the state where the services
are received. For the purposes of this section, receipts from the performance of services provided
to a corporation, partnership, or trust may only be attributed to a state where it has a fixed place of
doing business. If the state where the services are received is not readily determinable or is a state
where the corporation, partnership, or trust receiving the service does not have a fixed place of doing
business, the services shall be deemed to be received at the location of the office of the customer
from which the services were ordered in the regular course of the customer's trade or business. If
the ordering office cannot be determined, the services shall be deemed to be received at the office
of the customer to which the services are billed.
    (k) For the purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 6, paragraph (l), receipts from
management, distribution, or administrative services performed by a corporation or trust for a fund
of a corporation or trust regulated under United States Code, title 15, sections 80a-1 through 80a-64,
must be attributed to the state where the shareholder of the fund resides. Under this paragraph,
receipts for services attributed to shareholders are determined on the basis of the ratio of: (1) the
average of the outstanding shares in the fund owned by shareholders residing within Minnesota
at the beginning and end of each year; and (2) the average of the total number of outstanding
shares in the fund at the beginning and end of each year. Residence of the shareholder, in the case
of an individual, is determined by the mailing address furnished by the shareholder to the fund.
Residence of the shareholder, when the shares are held by an insurance company as a depositor for
the insurance company policyholders, is the mailing address of the policyholders. In the case of an
insurance company holding the shares as a depositor for the insurance company policyholders, if
the mailing address of the policyholders cannot be determined by the taxpayer, the receipts must be
excluded from both the numerator and denominator. Residence of other shareholders is the mailing
address of the shareholder.

    (b) "Receipts" for this purpose means gross income, including net taxable gain on disposition
of assets, including securities and money market instruments, when derived from transactions and
activities in the regular course of the taxpayer's trade or business.
   (c) "Money market instruments" means federal funds sold and securities purchased under
agreements to resell, commercial paper, banker's acceptances, and purchased certificates of deposit
and similar instruments to the extent that the instruments are reflected as assets under generally
accepted accounting principles.
    (d) "Securities" means United States Treasury securities, obligations of United States
government agencies and corporations, obligations of state and political subdivisions, corporate
stock, bonds, and other securities, participations in securities backed by mortgages held by United
States or state government agencies, loan-backed securities and similar investments to the extent
the investments are reflected as assets under generally accepted accounting principles.
    (e) Receipts from the lease or rental of real or tangible personal property, including both finance
leases and true leases, must be attributed to this state if the property is located in this state. Receipts
from the lease or rental of tangible personal property that is characteristically moving property,
including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, rolling stock, aircraft, vessels, or mobile equipment
are included in the numerator of the receipts factor to the extent that the property is used in this state.
The extent of the use of moving property is determined as follows:
   (1) A motor vehicle is used wholly in the state in which it is registered.
    (2) The extent that rolling stock is used in this state is determined by multiplying the receipts
from the lease or rental of the rolling stock by a fraction, the numerator of which is the miles traveled
within this state by the leased or rented rolling stock and the denominator of which is the total miles
traveled by the leased or rented rolling stock.
    (3) The extent that an aircraft is used in this state is determined by multiplying the receipts from
the lease or rental of the aircraft by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of landings of
the aircraft in this state and the denominator of which is the total number of landings of the aircraft.
    (4) The extent that a vessel, mobile equipment, or other mobile property is used in the state
is determined by multiplying the receipts from the lease or rental of property by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days during the taxable year the property was in this state and
the denominator of which is the total days in the taxable year.
    (f) Interest income and other receipts from assets in the nature of loans that are secured primarily
by real estate or tangible personal property must be attributed to this state if the security property is
located in this state under the principles stated in paragraph (e).
   (g) Interest income and other receipts from consumer loans not secured by real or tangible
personal property that are made to residents of this state, whether at a place of business, by traveling
loan officer, by mail, by telephone or other electronic means, must be attributed to this state.
    (h) Interest income and other receipts from commercial loans and installment obligations that are
unsecured by real or tangible personal property or secured by intangible property must be attributed
to this state if the proceeds of the loan are to be applied in this state. If it cannot be determined where
the funds are to be applied, the income and receipts are attributed to the state in which the office of
the borrower from which the application would be made in the regular course of business is located.
10926                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [119TH DAY

If this cannot be determined, the transaction is disregarded in the apportionment formula.
    (i) Interest income and other receipts from a participating financial institution's portion of
participation and syndication loans must be attributed under paragraphs (e) to (h). A participation
loan is an arrangement in which a lender makes a loan to a borrower and then sells, assigns, or
otherwise transfers all or a part of the loan to a purchasing financial institution. A syndication loan
is a loan transaction involving multiple financial institutions in which all the lenders are named as
parties to the loan documentation, are known to the borrower, and have privity of contract with
the borrower.
    (j) Interest income and other receipts including service charges from financial institution credit
card and travel and entertainment credit card receivables and credit card holders' fees must be
attributed to the state to which the card charges and fees are regularly billed.
    (k) Merchant discount income derived from financial institution credit card holder transactions
with a merchant must be attributed to the state in which the merchant is located. In the case of
merchants located within and outside the state, only receipts from merchant discounts attributable
to sales made from locations within the state are attributed to this state. It is presumed, subject
to rebuttal, that the location of a merchant is the address shown on the invoice submitted by the
merchant to the taxpayer.
    (l) Receipts from the performance of fiduciary and other services must be attributed to the state in
which the services are received. For the purposes of this section, services provided to a corporation,
partnership, or trust must be attributed to a state where it has a fixed place of doing business. If the
state where the services are received is not readily determinable or is a state where the corporation,
partnership, or trust does not have a fixed place of doing business, the services shall be deemed to
be received at the location of the office of the customer from which the services were ordered in the
regular course of the customer's trade or business. If the ordering office cannot be determined, the
services shall be deemed to be received at the office of the customer to which the services are billed.
    (m) Receipts from the issuance of travelers checks and money orders must be attributed to the
state in which the checks and money orders are purchased.
    (n) Receipts from investments of a financial institution in securities and from money market
instruments must be apportioned to this state based on the ratio that total deposits from this state, its
residents, including any business with an office or other place of business in this state, its political
subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities bear to the total deposits from all states, their residents,
their political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities. In the case of an unregulated financial
institution subject to this section, these receipts are apportioned to this state based on the ratio that
its gross business income, excluding such receipts, earned from sources within this state bears to
gross business income, excluding such receipts, earned from sources within all states. For purposes
of this subdivision, deposits made by this state, its residents, its political subdivisions, agencies,
and instrumentalities must be attributed to this state, whether or not the deposits are accepted or
maintained by the taxpayer at locations within this state.
   (o) A financial institution's interest in property described in section 290.015, subdivision 3,
paragraph (b), is included in the receipts factor in the same manner as assets in the nature of securities
or money market instruments are included in paragraph (n).

    Subd. 2. Developing a set of criteria. A business subsidy may not be granted until the grantor
has adopted criteria after a public hearing for awarding business subsidies that comply with this
section. The criteria may not be adopted on a case-by-case basis. The criteria must set specific
119TH DAY]                           SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                        10931

minimum requirements that recipients must meet in order to be eligible to receive business subsidies.
The criteria must include a specific wage floor for the wages to be paid for the jobs created. The wage
floor may be stated as a specific dollar amount or may be stated as a formula that will generate a
specific dollar amount. A grantor may deviate from its criteria by documenting in writing the reason
for the deviation and attaching a copy of the document to its next annual report to the department. The
commissioner of employment and economic development may assist local government agencies in
developing criteria. A copy of the criteria must be submitted to the Department of Employment and
Economic Development along with the first annual report following the enactment of this section
or with the first annual report after it has adopted criteria, whichever is earlier. Notwithstanding
section 116J.993, subdivision 3, clauses (1) and (21), for the purpose of this subdivision, "business
subsidies" as defined under section 116J.993 includes the following forms of financial assistance:
   (1) a business subsidy of $25,000 or more; and
   (2) business loans and guarantees of $75,000 or more.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 116J.994, subdivision 5, is amended to read:

grantor must provide public notice and a hearing on the subsidy. A public hearing and notice under
this subdivision is not required if a hearing and notice on the subsidy is otherwise required by law.
    (b) Public notice of a proposed business subsidy under this subdivision by a state government
grantor, other than the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board, must be published in the
State Register. Public notice of a proposed business subsidy under this subdivision by a local
government grantor or the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board must be published in
a local newspaper of general circulation. The public notice must identify the location at which
information about the business subsidy, including a summary of the terms of the subsidy, is
available. Published notice should be sufficiently conspicuous in size and placement to distinguish
the notice from the surrounding text. The grantor must make the information available in printed
paper copies and, if possible, on the Internet. The government agency must provide at least a
ten-day notice for the public hearing.
   (c) The public notice must include the date, time, and place of the hearing.
   (d) The public hearing by a state government grantor other than the Iron Range Resources and
Rehabilitation Board must be held in St. Paul.
   (e) If more than one nonstate grantor provides a business subsidy to the same recipient, the
nonstate grantors may designate one nonstate grantor to hold a single public hearing regarding the
business subsidies provided by all nonstate grantors. For the purposes of this paragraph, "nonstate
grantor" includes the iron range resources and rehabilitation board.
    (f) The public notice of any public meeting about a business subsidy agreement, including those
required by this subdivision and by subdivision 4, must include notice that a person with residence
in or the owner of taxable property in the granting jurisdiction may file a written complaint with the
grantor if the grantor fails to comply with sections 116J.993 to 116J.995, and that no action may be
filed against the grantor for the failure to comply unless a written complaint is filed.

awarded any business subsidies, must file a report by April 1 of each year with the commissioner.
Local government agencies of a local government with a population of 2,500 or less are exempt

the commissioner shall issue a warning to the government agency. If the commissioner has still not
received the report by June 1 of that same year from an entity required to report, then that government
agency may not award any business subsidies until the report has been filed.
    (b) The report required under paragraph (a) is also required for financial assistance of $25,000
and greater that is excluded from the definition of "business subsidy" by section 116J.993,
subdivision 3, clause (1), and of $75,000 and greater that is excluded from the definition of
"business subsidy" by section 116J.993, subdivision 3, clause (21). The report for the financial
assistance under this paragraph must be completed within one year of the granting of the financial
assistance. The report required for financial assistance under this paragraph must include:
   (1) the name of the recipient, its organizational structure, its address and contact information,
and its industry sector;

assistance and the total project in which the financial assistance is included, the hourly wage of each
job created, and the cost of health insurance provided by the employer;

   (5) the name and address of the parent corporation of the recipient, if any; and
   (6) any other information the commissioner may request.

October 15 of each year, every qualified business, as defined under section 469.310, subdivision 11,
must file with the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, a report listing the tax
benefits under section 469.315 received by the business for the previous year.
    (b) The commissioner shall send notice to each business that fails to timely submit the report
required under paragraph (a). The notice shall demand that the business submit the report within 60
days. Where good cause exists, the commissioner may extend the period for submitting the report
as long as a request for extension is filed by the business before the expiration of the 60-day period.
The commissioner shall notify the commissioner of the Department of Employment and Economic
Development and the appropriate job opportunity subzone administrator whenever notice is sent to
a business under this paragraph.
    (c) A business that fails to submit the report as required under paragraph (b) is no longer a
qualified business under section 469.310, subdivision 11, and is subject to the repayment provisions

   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290.06, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 35. Seed capital investment credit. (a) An individual, estate, or trust is allowed a credit
against the tax imposed by this chapter for investments in a qualifying business certified under
section 116J.8732, subdivision 3. The credit equals 45 percent of the amount invested by the
taxpayer in qualified businesses during the taxable year. The credit must not exceed $112,500 for
119TH DAY]                            SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                        10935

each taxable year.
    (b) A pass-through entity that invests in a qualified business must be considered to be the
taxpayer for purposes of the investment limitations in this subdivision and the amount of the
credit allowed with respect to a pass-through entity's investment in a qualified business must
be determined at the pass-through entity level. The amount of the total credit determined at the
pass-through entity level must be allowed to the members in proportion to their respective interests
in the pass-through entity.
    (c) An investment made in a qualified business from the assets of a retirement plan is deemed
to be the retirement plan participant's investment for the purpose of this subdivision if a separate
account is maintained for the plan participant and the participant directly controls where the account
assets are invested.
    (d) The investment must be made on or after the certification effective date and must be at risk
in the business to be eligible for the tax credit under this subdivision. An investment for which a
credit is received under this subdivision must remain in the qualified business for at least three years.
Investments placed in escrow do not qualify for the credit.
    (e) The entire amount of an investment for which a credit is claimed under this subdivision must
be expended by the qualified business for plant, equipment, research and development, marketing
and sales activity, or working capital for the qualified business.
    (f) A taxpayer who owns a controlling interest in the qualified business or who receives more
than 50 percent of the taxpayer's gross annual income from the qualified business is not entitled to
a credit under this subdivision. A member of the immediate family of a taxpayer disqualified by
this subdivision is not entitled to the credit under this subdivision. For purposes of this subdivision,
"immediate family" means the taxpayer's spouse, parent, sibling, or child or the spouse of any such
person.
    (g) The commissioner may disallow any credit otherwise allowed under this subdivision if any
representation by a business in the application for certification as a qualified business proves to be
false or if the taxpayer or qualified business fails to satisfy any conditions under this subdivision or
section 116J.8732 or any conditions consistent with those requirements otherwise determined by the
commissioner. The commissioner has four years after the due date of the return or after the return
was filed, whichever period expires later, to audit the credit and assess additional tax that may be
found due to failure to comply with the provisions of this subdivision and section 116J.8732. The
amount of any credit disallowed by the commissioner that reduced the taxpayer's income tax liability
for any or all applicable tax years, plus penalty and interest as provided under chapter 289A, must
be paid by the taxpayer.
    (h) If the amount of the credit under this subdivision for any taxable year exceeds the limitations
under paragraph (a), the excess is a credit carryover to each of the four succeeding taxable years.
The entire amount of the excess unused credit for the taxable year must be carried first to the earliest
of the taxable years to which the credit may be carried. The amount of the unused credit that may
be added under this paragraph may not exceed the taxpayer's liability for tax, less the credit for
the taxable year. Each year, the aggregate amount of seed capital investment tax credit allowed for
investments under this subdivision is limited to allocations that a border city has available for tax
reductions in border city enterprise zones under section 469.169. The city must annually notify the
commissioner of the amount of its section 469.169 allocations that it wishes to use to provide credits
10936                                   JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                       [119TH DAY

under this paragraph and the commissioner, after verifying the available allocation, shall implement
the limit under this paragraph. If investments in qualified businesses reported to the commissioner
exceed the limit on credits for investments imposed by this subdivision, the credit must be allowed
to taxpayers in the chronological order of their investments in qualified businesses as determined
from the forms filed under section 116J.8732.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2008, for taxable years beginning after
December 31, 2007, and only applies to investments made after the qualified business has been
certified by the commissioner of employment and economic development.

fund under section 475.61 shall be reduced by the amount available or reasonably anticipated to be

    Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 469.033, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
     Subd. 6. Operation area as taxing district, special tax. All of the territory included within the
area of operation of any authority shall constitute a taxing district for the purpose of levying and
collecting special benefit taxes as provided in this subdivision. All of the taxable property, both real
and personal, within that taxing district shall be deemed to be benefited by projects to the extent of
the special taxes levied under this subdivision. Subject to the consent by resolution of the governing
body of the city in and for which it was created, an authority may levy a tax upon all taxable property
within that taxing district. The tax shall be extended, spread, and included with and as a part of the
general taxes for state, county, and municipal purposes by the county auditor, to be collected and
enforced therewith, together with the penalty, interest, and costs. As the tax, including any penalties,
interest, and costs, is collected by the county treasurer it shall be accumulated and kept in a separate
fund to be known as the "housing and redevelopment project fund." The money in the fund shall
be turned over to the authority at the same time and in the same manner that the tax collections
for the city are turned over to the city, and shall be expended only for the purposes of sections
469.001 to 469.047. It shall be paid out upon vouchers signed by the chair of the authority or an
authorized representative. The amount of the levy shall be an amount approved by the governing

in accordance with the budget procedure of the city in the same manner as required of executive
departments of the city or, if no budgets are required to be filed, by August 1. The amount of the tax
levy for the following year shall be based on that budget.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for property taxes payable in 2009.
    Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 469.177, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 13. Correction of errors. (a) If the county auditor, as a result of an error or mistake,
decertifies a district, fails to certify a district, incorrectly certifies a district, or otherwise fails to
correctly compute the amount of increment, the county auditor may undertake one or more of the
following actions to correct the error or mistake:
    (1) certify the original tax capacity of the affected parcels at the appropriate value for a later
taxes payable year and extend the duration of the district, in whole or in part, to compensate;
   (2) recertify the affected parcels and extend duration of the district, in whole or in part, to
compensate;
    (3) recertify or correct the original tax capacity rate for the district;
    (4) adjust the tax rates of one or more of the taxing districts imposing taxes in the tax increment
financing districts for one or more years to recoup amounts advanced by the county or other entity
to the authority to replace the reduced increments; or
    (5) take other appropriate action so that the amount of increment compensates for or offsets the
error or mistake and correctly reflects application of the law.
    (b) At least 30 days before exercising authority under this subdivision, the county auditor must
notify the authority and the municipality, in writing, of the intent to do so, including supporting
information to describe reason for the proposed action. The authority and municipality may waive
the time requirement of this paragraph. If the city or the authority objects before expiration of the
30-day period, the matter must be submitted to the commissioner of revenue for a decision or
resolution of the dispute. The commissioner of revenue shall consult with the Office of the State
Auditor before making a decision.
    (c) The county auditor must notify the commissioner of revenue and the Office of the State
Auditor of corrections made under this subdivision. The notification must be made in the form and
manner and at the time prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner shall incorporate the
corrections in the tax increment financing district tax list supplement, as appropriate.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
all tax increment financing districts, regardless of when the request for certification was made or
when the error occurred.
    Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 469.319, is amended to read:

tax, including the credit payable under section 469.318, a reduction of tax is deemed to have been

paragraph (c) any time within three years after the business becomes subject to repayment under
subdivision 1.
    (h) A business is not entitled to any income tax or franchise tax benefits, including refundable
credits, for any part of the year in which the business becomes subject to repayment under this
section nor for any year thereafter. Property is not exempt from tax under section 272.02, subdivision
64, for any taxes payable in the year following the year in which the property became subject to
repayment under this section nor for any year thereafter. A business is not eligible for any sales tax
benefits beginning with goods or services purchased or first put to a taxable use on the day that the
business becomes subject to repayment under this section.

and economic development and appropriate officials from the local government units in which
the qualified business is located, determines that requiring repayment of the tax is not in the best
interest of the state or the local government units and the business ceased operating as a result of
circumstances beyond its control including, but not limited to:
   (1) a natural disaster;
   (2) unforeseen industry trends; or
   (3) loss of a major supplier or customer.
    (b)(1) The commissioner shall waive repayment required under subdivision 1a if the
commissioner has waived repayment by the operating business under subdivision 1, unless the
person that received benefits without having to operate a business in the zone was a contributing
factor in the qualified business becoming subject to repayment under subdivision 1;
   (2) the commissioner shall waive the repayment required under subdivision 1a, even if the
repayment has not been waived for the operating business if:
   (i) the person that received benefits without having to operate a business in the zone and the
business that operated in the zone are not related parties as defined in section 267(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended through December 31, 2007; and
    (ii) actions of the person were not a contributing factor in the qualified business becoming subject
to repayment under subdivision 1.
    Subd. 6. Reconciliation. Where this section is inconsistent with section 116J.994, subdivision
3, paragraph (e), or 6, or any other provisions of sections 116J.993 to 116J.995, this section prevails.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. The amendment to subdivision 4, paragraph (c), of this section is effective
the day following final enactment. The amendment to subdivision 4, paragraph (f), is effective
retroactively from January 1, 2008, and applies to all businesses that become subject to this section
in 2008. The rest of this section is effective retroactively from January 1, 2004, except that for
violations that occur before the day following final enactment, this section does not apply if the
business has repaid the benefits or the commissioner has granted a waiver.
  Sec. 14. [469.3191] BREACH OF AGREEMENTS BY BUSINESSES THAT CONTINUE
TO OPERATE IN ZONE.
    (a) A "business in violation of its business subsidy agreement but not subject to section 469.319"
means a business that is operating in violation of the business subsidy agreement but maintains a
level of operations in the zone that does not subject it to the repayment provisions of section 469.319,
subdivision 1, clause (1).
    (b) A business described in paragraph (a) that does not sign a new or amended business subsidy
agreement, as authorized under paragraph (h), is subject to repayment of benefits under section
469.319 from the day that it ceases to perform in the zone a substantial level of activities described
in the business subsidy agreement.
    (c) A business described in paragraph (a) ceases being a qualified business after the last day that
it has to meet the goals stated in the agreement.

    (d) A business is not entitled to any income tax or franchise tax benefits, including refundable
credits, for any part of the year in which the business is no longer a qualified business under
paragraph (c), and thereafter. A business is not eligible for sales tax benefits beginning with goods
or services purchased or put to a taxable use on the day that it is no longer a qualified business
under paragraph (c). Property is not exempt from tax under section 272.02, subdivision 64, for any
taxes payable in the year following the year in which the business is no longer a qualified business
under paragraph (c), and thereafter.
     (e) A business described in paragraph (a) that wants to resume eligibility for benefits under
section 469.315 must request that the commissioner of employment and economic development
determine the length of time that the business is ineligible for benefits. The commissioner shall
determine the length of ineligibility by applying the proportionate level of performance under the
agreement to the total duration of the zone as measured from the date that the business subsidy
agreement was executed. The length of time must not be less than one full year for each tax benefit
listed in section 469.315. The commissioner of employment and economic development and the
appropriate local government officials shall consult with the commissioner of revenue to ensure
that the period of ineligibility includes at least one full year of benefits for each tax.
   (f) The length of ineligibility determined under paragraph (e) must be applied by reducing the
zone duration for the property by the duration of the ineligibility.
   (g) The zone duration of property that has been adjusted under paragraph (f) must not be altered
again to permit the business additional benefits under section 469.315.
    (h) A business described in paragraph (a) becomes eligible for benefits available under section
469.315 by entering into a new or amended business subsidy agreement with the appropriate local
government unit. The new or amended agreement must cover a period beginning from the date of
ineligibility under the original business subsidy agreement, through the zone duration determined
by the commissioner under paragraph (f). No exemption of property taxes under section 272.02,
subdivision 64, is available under the new or amended agreement for property taxes due or paid
before the date of the final execution of the new or amended agreement, but unpaid taxes due after
that date need not be paid.
   (i) A business that violates the terms of an agreement authorized under paragraph (h) is
permanently barred from seeking benefits under section 469.315 and is subject to the repayment
provisions under section 469.319 effective from the day that the business ceases to operate as a
qualified business in the zone under the second agreement.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively from January 1, 2004. For violations
that occur before the day following final enactment, this section does not apply if the business has
repaid the benefits or the commissioner has granted a waiver.
  Sec. 15. [469.3192] PROHIBITION AGAINST AMENDMENTS TO BUSINESS
SUBSIDY AGREEMENT.
   Except as authorized under section 469.3191, under no circumstance shall terms of any
agreement required as a condition for eligibility for benefits listed under section 469.315 be
amended to change job creation, job retention, or wage goals included in the agreement.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
10942                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                      [119TH DAY

all agreements executed before, on, or after the effective date.
  Sec. 16. [469.3193] CERTIFICATION OF CONTINUING ELIGIBILITY FOR JOBZ
BENEFITS.
    (a) By December 1 of each year, every qualified business must certify to the commissioner of
revenue, on a form prescribed by the commissioner of revenue, whether it is in compliance with any
agreement required as a condition for eligibility for benefits listed under section 469.315. A business
that fails to submit the certification, or any business, including those still operating in the zone, that
submits a certification that the commissioner of revenue later determines materially misrepresents
the business's compliance with the agreement, is subject to the repayment provisions under section
469.319 from January 1 of the year in which the report is due or the date that the business became
subject to section 469.319, whichever is earlier. Any such business is permanently barred from
obtaining benefits under section 469.315. For purposes of this section, the bar applies to an entity
and also applies to any individuals or entities that have an ownership interest of at least 20 percent
of the entity.
    (b) Before the sanctions under paragraph (a) apply to a business that fails to submit the
certification, the commissioner of revenue shall send notice to the business, demanding that the
certification be submitted within 30 days and advising the business of the consequences for failing
to do so. The commissioner of revenue shall notify the commissioner of employment and economic
development and the appropriate job opportunity subzone administrator whenever notice is sent to
a business under this paragraph.
    (c) The certification required under this section is public.
    (d) The commissioner of revenue shall promptly notify the commissioner of employment and
economic development of all businesses that certify that they are not in compliance with the terms
of their business subsidy agreement and all businesses that fail to file the certification.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

the issuing authority may make any and all covenants with bondholders, or with a trustee for the
10952                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [119TH DAY

bondholders, that are determined by the issuing authority to be necessary and proper to ensure the
marketability of the revenue bonds and the segregation and application of the revenues pledged to
the payment of the revenue bonds. Any tax revenues transferred to the issuing authority that are
not required by the terms of the bonds or other obligations issued under this section, or related
documents, to be applied to the payment of the principal, premium, or interest on the bonds or
other obligations, the funding of reserves, or the payment of fees, costs, or reimbursements, must

purchases or payment at maturity of the bonds to be refunded, or the redemption of the outstanding
bonds on the first redemption date after delivery of the refunding bonds and may, until so used, be
placed in escrow to be applied to the purchase, retirement, or redemption. Refunding bonds issued
under this subdivision must be issued and secured in the manner provided by the issuing authority.
    Subd. 7. Not a general or moral obligation. Bonds issued under this section are not general or
moral obligations of the issuing authority, and the full faith, credit, and taxing powers of the state
are not pledged for their payment. The bonds may not be paid directly, in whole or in part, from a
tax of statewide application on any class of property, income, transaction, or privilege. Payment of
the bonds is limited to the revenues explicitly authorized to be pledged under this section. The state
neither makes nor has a moral obligation to pay the bonds if the pledged revenues and other legal
security for them is insufficient.
    Subd. 8. Trustee. The issuing authority may contract with and appoint a trustee for bond holders.
The trustee has the powers and authority vested in it by the issuing authority under the bond and
trust indentures.

issuing authority is valid and binding from the time the pledge is made. The money or property
pledged and later received by the issuing authority is immediately subject to the lien of the pledge
without any physical delivery of the property or money or further act, and the lien of any pledge
is valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise
against the issuing authority, whether or not those parties have notice of the lien or pledge. The
119TH DAY]                            SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                        10953

resolution, indenture, agreement, or other instrument by which a pledge is created need not be

payment of the principal, premium, or interest on the bonds or other obligations, the funding of
reserves, or the payment of fees, costs, or reimbursements, must be released from the pledge to the
bonds and other obligations in accordance with the terms of the bonds, other obligations, and related
documents.

with bondholders that may then exist, may, out of any money available for the purpose, purchase
bonds of the issuing authority at a price not exceeding (1) if the bonds are then redeemable, the
redemption price then applicable plus accrued interest, or (2) if the bonds are not redeemable, the
redemption price applicable on the first date after the purchase upon which the bonds become subject
to redemption plus accrued interest to that date.
     Subd. 11. State pledge against impairment of contracts. The state pledges and agrees with the
holders of any bonds that the state will not limit or alter the rights vested in the issuing authority to
fulfill the terms of any agreements made with the bondholders, or in any way impair the rights and
remedies of the holders until the bonds, together with interest on them, with interest on any unpaid
installments of interest, and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by
or on behalf of the bondholders, are fully met and discharged. The issuing authority may include

(a) Except as provided in subdivision 14c, all land platted on or after August 1, 2001, located in a
metropolitan county, and not improved with a permanent structure, shall be assessed as provided in
this subdivision. The assessor shall determine the market value of each individual lot based upon
the highest and best use of the property as unplatted land. In establishing the market value of the
property, the assessor shall consider the sale price of the unplatted land or comparable sales of
unplatted land of similar use and similar availability of public utilities.
    (b) The market value determined in paragraph (a) shall be increased as follows for each of
the three assessment years immediately following the final approval of the plat: one-third of the
difference between the property's unplatted market value as determined under paragraph (a) and the
market value based upon the highest and best use of the land as platted property shall be added in
each of the three subsequent assessment years.
    (c) Any increase in market value after the first assessment year following the plat's final approval
shall be added to the property's market value in the next assessment year. Notwithstanding paragraph
(b), if the property is sold or transferred, or construction begins before the expiration of the three
years in paragraph (b), that lot shall be eligible for revaluation in the next assessment year. The
market value of a platted lot determined under this subdivision shall not exceed the value of that lot
based upon the highest and best use of the property as platted land.
   (d) For purposes of this section, "metropolitan county" means the counties of Anoka, Carver,
Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, and Washington.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2010 and thereafter.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.11, subdivision 14b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 14b. Vacant land platted on or after August 1, 2001; located in nonmetropolitan
counties. (a) All land platted on or after August 1, 2001, located in a nonmetropolitan county, and
not improved with a permanent structure, shall be assessed as provided in this subdivision. The
assessor shall determine the market value of each individual lot based upon the highest and best use
of the property as unplatted land. In establishing the market value of the property, the assessor shall
consider the sale price of the unplatted land or comparable sales of unplatted land of similar use and
similar availability of public utilities.
    (b) The market value determined in paragraph (a) shall be increased as follows for each of the
seven assessment years immediately following the final approval of the plat: one-seventh of the
difference between the property's unplatted market value as determined under paragraph (a) and the
market value based upon the highest and best use of the land as platted property shall be added in
each of the seven subsequent assessment years.

    (c) Any increase in market value after the first assessment year following the plat's final approval
shall be added to the property's market value in the next assessment year. Notwithstanding paragraph
(b), if the property is sold or transferred, or construction begins before the expiration of the seven
years in paragraph (b), that lot shall be eligible for revaluation in the next assessment year. The

   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.11, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 14c. Certain vacant land platted on or after August 1, 2001; located in metropolitan
county. (a) All land platted on or after August 1, 2001, located in a metropolitan county and
not improved with a structure shall be eligible for the phase-in assessment schedule under this
subdivision, provided the property (i) is classified homestead under section 273.13, subdivision
22 or 23, in the assessment year prior to the year the initial platting begins on the property; (ii)
has been owned or part-owned by the same person for the ten consecutive years prior to the initial
platting; and (iii) remains under the same ownership in the current assessment year.
    (b) Based upon the assessor's records, the assessor shall obtain the estimated market value of
each individual lot based upon the highest and best use of the property as unplatted land for the
assessment year that the property was platted. In establishing the market value of the property, the
assessor shall have considered the sale price of the unplatted land or comparable sales of unplatted
land of similar use and similar availability of public utilities.
    (c) To the market value determined in paragraph (b) shall be added one-seventh of the
difference between the property's unplatted market value as determined under paragraph (b) and
the market value based upon the highest and best use of the land as platted property in the current
year, multiplied by the number of assessment years since the property was platted, in each of the
subsequent assessment years.
   (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (c), if the property is sold or transferred, or construction begins
before the expiration of the phase-in in paragraph (c), that lot shall be eligible for revaluation in the
next assessment year. The market value of a platted lot determined under this subdivision shall not
exceed the value of that lot based upon the highest and best use of the property as platted land.
    (e) Any owner of eligible property platted before July 1, 2008, must file an application with the
assessor in order to receive the phase-in under this subdivision for the remainder of the seven-year
period. The application must be filed before July 1 in order for the property to be eligible for
the current year's assessment. The commissioner shall prescribe a uniform application form and
instructions.
   (f) For purposes of this section, "metropolitan county" means the counties of Anoka, Carver,
Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, and Washington.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2009 and thereafter, except
that the portion of paragraph (d) referring to a lot that is sold or transferred is effective for taxes
payable in 2010 and thereafter.

the provisions of subdivision 9. Sale of the land prior to the expiration of the three-year period

payment of the current year's deferred taxes plus payment of deferred taxes for the two prior years;
sale during the second year the land no longer qualifies requires payment of the current year's
deferred taxes plus payment of the deferred taxes for the prior year; and sale during the third year
the land no longer qualifies requires payment of the current year's deferred taxes. Deferred taxes

first, all deferred special assessments plus interest are payable in equal installments spread over

which the assessments were levied. If the bonds have matured, the deferred special assessments

timely paid.

under this section. This paragraph applies to land that has not qualified under this section for taxes
payable in 2009 or previous years.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2010 and thereafter.
     Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.111, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3a. Property no longer eligible for deferment. (a) Real estate receiving the tax deferment
under this section for assessment year 2008, but that does not qualify for the 2009 assessment year
due to changes in qualification requirements under this act, shall continue to qualify until any part
of the land is sold, transferred, or subdivided, provided that the property continues to meet the
requirements of Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.111, subdivision 3.
    (b) When property assessed under this subdivision is withdrawn from the program or becomes
ineligible, the property shall be subject to additional taxes, in the amount equal to the average
difference between the taxes determined in accordance with subdivision 4, and the amount
determined under subdivision 5, for the current year and the two preceding years, multiplied by
(1) three, in the case of class 2a property under section 273.13, subdivision 23, or any property
withdrawn before January 2, 2009, or (2) seven, in the case of property withdrawn after January
2, 2009, that is not class 2a property. The number of years used as the multiplier must not exceed
the number of years during which the property was subject to this section. The amount determined
under subdivision 5 shall not be greater than it would have been had the actual bona fide sale price
of the real property at an arm's-length transaction been used in lieu of the market value determined
under subdivision 5. The additional taxes shall be extended against the property on the tax list for
the current year, provided that no interest or penalties shall be levied on the additional taxes if
timely paid.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
     Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.111, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
      Subd. 4. Determination of value. (a) The value of any real estate described in subdivision 3

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.111, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 17. Implementation of program. This section must be applied to eligible properties by
all county assessors, beginning no later than assessments for taxes levied in 2009, payable in 2010,
and thereafter, unless the commissioner of revenue determines that a county is unable to comply
with this requirement, in which case the county must implement it for taxes levied in 2010, payable
in 2011, and thereafter.
  Sec. 21. [273.1115] AGGREGATE RESOURCE PRESERVATION PROPERTY TAX
LAW.
    Subdivision 1. Definitions. For purposes of this section, "commercial aggregate deposit" and
"actively mined" have the meanings given them in section 273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (l).
    Subd. 2. Requirement. Real estate is entitled to valuation under this section only if all of the
following requirements are met:
10970                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [119TH DAY

      (1) the property is classified 1a, 1b, 2a, or 2b property under section 273.13, subdivisions 22 and
23;
      (2) the property is at least ten contiguous acres, when the application is filed under subdivision
3;
    (3) the owner has filed a completed application for deferment as specified in subdivision 3 with
the county assessor in the county in which the property is located;
      (4) there are no delinquent taxes on the property; and
      (5) a covenant on the land restricts its use as provided in subdivision 3, clause (4).
    Subd. 3. Application. Application for valuation deferment under this section must be filed by
May 1 of the assessment year. Any application filed and granted continues in effect for subsequent
years until the property no longer qualifies, provided that supplemental affidavits under subdivision
8 are timely filed. The application must be filed with the assessor of the county in which the real
property is located on such form as may be prescribed by the commissioner of revenue. The
application must be executed and acknowledged in the manner required by law to execute and
acknowledge a deed and must contain at least the following information and any other information
the commissioner deems necessary:
      (1) the legal description of the area;
      (2) the name and address of owner;
    (3) a copy of the affidavit filed under section 273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (l), when property
is classified as:
      (i) 1b under section 273.13, subdivision 22, paragraph (b);
      (ii) 2a under section 273.13, subdivision 23;
      (iii) 2b under section 273.13, subdivision 23; or
      (iv) 2e under section 273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (l).
    The application must include a similar document with the same information as contained in the
affidavit under section 273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (l); and
    (4) a statement of proof from the owner that the land contains a restrictive covenant limiting
its use for the property's surface to that which exists on the date of the application and limiting its
future use to the preparation and removal of the commercial aggregate deposit under its surface. To
qualify under this clause, the covenant must be binding on the owner or the owner's successor or
assignee, and run with the land, except as provided in subdivision 5 allowing for the cancellation of
the covenant under certain conditions.
    Subd. 4. Determination of value. Upon timely application by the owner as provided in
subdivision 3, notwithstanding sections 272.03, subdivision 8, and 273.11, the value of any
qualifying land described in subdivision 3 must be valued as if it were agricultural property, using a
per acre valuation equal to the current assessment year's average per acre valuation of agricultural
land in the county. The assessor shall not consider any additional value resulting from potential

alternative and future uses of the property. The buildings located on the land shall be valued by the
assessor in the normal manner.
    Subd. 5. Cancellation of covenant. The covenant required under subdivision 3 may be canceled
in two ways:
    (1) by the owner beginning with the next subsequent assessment year provided that the additional
taxes as determined under subdivision 7 are paid by the owner at the time of cancellation; or
    (2) by the city or town in which the property is located beginning with the next subsequent
assessment year, if the city council or town board:
   (i) changes the conditional use of the property;
   (ii) revokes the mining permit; or
   (iii) changes the zoning to disallow mining.
   No additional taxes are imposed on the property under this clause.
    Subd. 6. County termination. Within two years of the effective date of this section, a county
may, following notice and public hearing, terminate application of this section in the county. The
termination is effective upon adoption of a resolution of the county board. A county has 60 days
from receipt of the first application for enrollment under this section to notify the applicant and any
subsequent applicants of the county's intent to begin the process of terminating application of this
section in the county. The county must act on the termination within six months. Upon termination
by a vote of the county board, all applications received prior to and during notification of intent
to terminate shall be deemed void. If the county board does not act on the termination within six
months of notification, all applications for valuation for deferment received shall be deemed eligible
for consideration to be enrolled under this section. Following this initial 60-day grace period, a
termination applies prospectively and does not affect property enrolled under this section prior to
the termination date. A county may reauthorize application of this section by a resolution of the
county board revoking the termination.
    Subd. 7. Additional taxes. When real property which has been valued and assessed under this
section no longer qualifies, the portion of the land classified under subdivision 2, clause (1), is subject
to additional taxes. The additional tax amount is determined by:
    (1) computing the difference between (i) the current year's taxes determined in accordance with
subdivision 4, and (ii) an amount as determined by the assessor based upon the property's current
year's estimated market value of like real estate at its highest and best use and the appropriate local
tax rate; and
    (2) multiplying the amount determined in clause (1) by the number of years the land was in the
program under this section. The current year's estimated market value as determined by the assessor
must not exceed the market value that would result if the property was sold in an arms-length
transaction and must not be greater than it would have been had the actual bona fide sale price of the
property been used in lieu of that market value. The additional taxes must be extended against the
property on the tax list for the current year, except that interest or penalties must not be levied on
these additional taxes if timely paid. The additional tax under this subdivision must not be imposed
on that portion of the property which has actively been mined and has been removed from the
10972                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [119TH DAY

program based upon the supplemental affidavits filed under subdivision 8.
    Subd. 8. Supplemental affidavits; mining activity on land. When any portion of the property
begins to be actively mined, the owner must file a supplemental affidavit within 60 days from the
day any aggregate is removed stating the number of acres of the property that is actively being
mined. The acres actively being mined shall be (1) valued and classified under section 273.13,
subdivision 24, in the next subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource
preservation property tax program under this section. The additional taxes under subdivision 7 must
not be imposed on the acres that are actively being mined and have been removed from the program
under this section. Copies of the original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed
with the county assessor, the local zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Land and Minerals. A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent
portion of the property is actively mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres,
even if the actual mining activity constitutes less than five acres. Failure to file the affidavits timely
shall result in the property losing its valuation deferment under this section, and additional taxes
must be imposed as calculated under subdivision 7.
    Subd. 9. Lien. The additional tax imposed by this section is a lien upon the property assessed to
the same extent and for the same duration as other taxes imposed upon property within this state and,
when collected, must be distributed in the manner provided by law for the collection and distribution
of other property taxes.
    Subd. 10. Continuation of tax treatment upon sale. When real property qualifying under
subdivision 2 is sold, additional taxes must not be extended against the property if the property
continues to qualify under subdivision 2, and the new owner files an application with the assessor
for continued deferment within 30 days after the sale.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2009, payable in 2010, and
thereafter, except that for the 2009 assessment year, the application date under subdivision 5 shall
be September 1, 2009, and subdivision 6 is effective the day following final enactment.
  Sec. 22. [273.113] TAX CREDIT FOR PROPERTY IN PROPOSED BOVINE
TUBERCULOSIS MODIFIED ACCREDITED ZONE.
   Subdivision 1. Definition. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the
meanings given to them:
   (1) "proposed bovine tuberculosis modified accredited zone" means the modified accredited zone
proposed by the Board of Animal Health under section 35.244; and
   (2) "located within" means that the herd is kept in the area for at least a part of calendar year
2007.
    Subd. 2. Eligibility; amount of credit. Agricultural land classified under section 273.13,
subdivision 23, located within a proposed bovine tuberculosis modified accredited zone is eligible
for a property tax credit equal to the property tax on the parcel where the herd had been located,
excluding any tax attributable to residential structures. To begin to qualify for the tax credit, the
owner shall file an application with the county by December 1 of the levy year. The credit must be
given for each subsequent taxes payable year until the credit terminates under subdivision 4. The
assessor shall indicate the amount of the property tax reduction on the property tax statement of
119TH DAY]                           SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                      10973

each taxpayer receiving a credit under this section. The credit paid pursuant to this section shall be
deducted from the tax due on the property as provided in section 273.1393.
    Subd. 3. Reimbursement for lost revenue. The county auditor shall certify to the commissioner
of revenue, as part of the abstracts of tax lists required to be filed with the commissioner under
section 275.29, the amount of tax lost to the county from the property tax credit under subdivision
2. Any prior year adjustments must also be certified in the abstracts of tax lists. The commissioner
of revenue shall review the certifications to determine their accuracy. The commissioner may
make the changes in the certification that are considered necessary or return a certification to the
county auditor for corrections. The commissioner shall reimburse each taxing district for the taxes
lost. The payments must be made at the time provided in section 473H.10 for payment to taxing
jurisdictions in the same proportion that the ad valorem tax is distributed. The amount necessary to
make the reimbursements under this section is annually appropriated from the general fund to the
commissioner of revenue.
    Subd. 4. Termination of credit. The credits provided under this section cease to be available
beginning with taxes payable in the year following the date when the Board of Animal Health has
certified that the state is free of bovine tuberculosis.
    Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.121, as amended by Laws 2008, chapter 154,
article 13, section 28, is amended to read:
   273.121 VALUATION OF REAL PROPERTY, NOTICE.
    Subdivision 1. Notice. Any county assessor or city assessor having the powers of a county
assessor, valuing or classifying taxable real property shall in each year notify those persons whose
property is to be included on the assessment roll that year if the person's address is known to the
assessor, otherwise the occupant of the property. The notice shall be in writing and shall be sent
by ordinary mail at least ten days before the meeting of the local board of appeal and equalization
under section 274.01 or the review process established under section 274.13, subdivision 1c. Upon
written request by the owner of the property, the assessor may send the notice in electronic form
or by electronic mail instead of on paper or by ordinary mail. It shall contain: (1) the market value
for the current and prior assessment, (2) the limited market value under section 273.11, subdivision
1a, for the current and prior assessment, (3) the qualifying amount of any improvements under
section 273.11, subdivision 16, for the current assessment, (4) the market value subject to taxation
after subtracting the amount of any qualifying improvements for the current assessment, (5) the
classification of the property for the current and prior assessment, (6) a note that if the property
is homestead and at least 45 years old, improvements made to the property may be eligible for a
valuation exclusion under section 273.11, subdivision 16, (7) the assessor's office address, and (8)
the dates, places, and times set for the meetings of the local board of appeal and equalization, the
review process established under section 274.13, subdivision 1c, and the county board of appeal
and equalization. The commissioner of revenue shall specify the form of the notice. The assessor
shall attach to the assessment roll a statement that the notices required by this section have been
mailed. Any assessor who is not provided sufficient funds from the assessor's governing body to
provide such notices, may make application to the commissioner of revenue to finance such notices.
The commissioner of revenue shall conduct an investigation and, if satisfied that the assessor does
not have the necessary funds, issue a certification to the commissioner of finance of the amount
necessary to provide such notices. The commissioner of finance shall issue a warrant for such amount
and shall deduct such amount from any state payment to such county or municipality. The necessary
10974                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [119TH DAY

funds to make such payments are hereby appropriated. Failure to receive the notice shall in no way
affect the validity of the assessment, the resulting tax, the procedures of any board of review or
equalization, or the enforcement of delinquent taxes by statutory means.
   Subd. 2. Availability of data. The notice must state where the information on the property is
available, the times when the information may be viewed by the public, and the county's Web site
address.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for notices prepared in 2009 and thereafter.
   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.124, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. General rule. (a) Residential real estate that is occupied and used for the purposes
of a homestead by its owner, who must be a Minnesota resident, is a residential homestead.
   Agricultural land, as defined in section 273.13, subdivision 23, that is occupied and used as a
homestead by its owner, who must be a Minnesota resident, is an agricultural homestead.
   Dates for establishment of a homestead and homestead treatment provided to particular types of
property are as provided in this section.
   Property held by a trustee under a trust is eligible for homestead classification if the requirements
under this chapter are satisfied.
    The assessor shall require proof, as provided in subdivision 13, of the facts upon which
classification as a homestead may be determined. Notwithstanding any other law, the assessor may
at any time require a homestead application to be filed in order to verify that any property classified
as a homestead continues to be eligible for homestead status. Notwithstanding any other law to
the contrary, the Department of Revenue may, upon request from an assessor, verify whether an
individual who is requesting or receiving homestead classification has filed a Minnesota income
tax return as a resident for the most recent taxable year for which the information is available.
    When there is a name change or a transfer of homestead property, the assessor may reclassify
the property in the next assessment unless a homestead application is filed to verify that the property
continues to qualify for homestead classification.
    (b) For purposes of this section, homestead property shall include property which is used for
purposes of the homestead but is separated from the homestead by a road, street, lot, waterway,
or other similar intervening property. The term "used for purposes of the homestead" shall include
but not be limited to uses for gardens, garages, or other outbuildings commonly associated with
a homestead, but shall not include vacant land held primarily for future development. In order
to receive homestead treatment for the noncontiguous property, the owner must use the property
for the purposes of the homestead, and must apply to the assessor, both by the deadlines given in
subdivision 9. After initial qualification for the homestead treatment, additional applications for
subsequent years are not required.
    (c) Residential real estate that is occupied and used for purposes of a homestead by a relative of
the owner is a homestead but only to the extent of the homestead treatment that would be provided if
the related owner occupied the property. For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (g), "relative"
means a parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, uncle, aunt,
nephew, or niece. This relationship may be by blood or marriage. Property that has been classified
119TH DAY]                           SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                       10975

as seasonal residential recreational property at any time during which it has been owned by the
current owner or spouse of the current owner will not be reclassified as a homestead unless it is
occupied as a homestead by the owner; this prohibition also applies to property that, in the absence
of this paragraph, would have been classified as seasonal residential recreational property at the time
when the residence was constructed. Neither the related occupant nor the owner of the property may
claim a property tax refund under chapter 290A for a homestead occupied by a relative. In the case
of a residence located on agricultural land, only the house, garage, and immediately surrounding one
acre of land shall be classified as a homestead under this paragraph, except as provided in paragraph
(d).
    (d) Agricultural property that is occupied and used for purposes of a homestead by a relative of
the owner, is a homestead, only to the extent of the homestead treatment that would be provided if
the related owner occupied the property, and only if all of the following criteria are met:
   (1) the relative who is occupying the agricultural property is a son, daughter, brother, sister,
grandson, granddaughter, father, or mother of the owner of the agricultural property or a son,
daughter, brother, sister, grandson, or granddaughter of the spouse of the owner of the agricultural
property;
   (2) the owner of the agricultural property must be a Minnesota resident;
    (3) the owner of the agricultural property must not receive homestead treatment on any other
agricultural property in Minnesota; and
   (4) the owner of the agricultural property is limited to only one agricultural homestead per family
under this paragraph.
   Neither the related occupant nor the owner of the property may claim a property tax refund
under chapter 290A for a homestead occupied by a relative qualifying under this paragraph. For
purposes of this paragraph, "agricultural property" means the house, garage, other farm buildings
and structures, and agricultural land.
   Application must be made to the assessor by the owner of the agricultural property to receive
homestead benefits under this paragraph. The assessor may require the necessary proof that the
requirements under this paragraph have been met.
    (e) In the case of property owned by a property owner who is married, the assessor must not deny
homestead treatment in whole or in part if only one of the spouses occupies the property and the other
spouse is absent due to: (1) marriage dissolution proceedings, (2) legal separation, (3) employment
or self-employment in another location, or (4) other personal circumstances causing the spouses
to live separately, not including an intent to obtain two homestead classifications for property tax
purposes. To qualify under clause (3), the spouse's place of employment or self-employment must
be at least 50 miles distant from the other spouse's place of employment, and the homesteads must
be at least 50 miles distant from each other. Homestead treatment, in whole or in part, shall not be
denied to the owner's spouse who previously occupied the residence with the owner if the absence
of the owner is due to one of the exceptions provided in this paragraph.
   (f) The assessor must not deny homestead treatment in whole or in part if:
   (1) in the case of a property owner who is not married, the owner is absent due to residence in
a nursing home, boarding care facility, or an elderly assisted living facility property as defined in
10976                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [119TH DAY

section 273.13, subdivision 25a, and the property is not otherwise occupied; or
    (2) in the case of a property owner who is married, the owner or the owner's spouse or both
are absent due to residence in a nursing home, boarding care facility, or an elderly assisted living
facility property as defined in section 273.13, subdivision 25a, and the property is not occupied or
is occupied only by the owner's spouse.
     (g) If an individual is purchasing property with the intent of claiming it as a homestead and
is required by the terms of the financing agreement to have a relative shown on the deed as a
co-owner, the assessor shall allow a full homestead classification. This provision only applies to
first-time purchasers, whether married or single, or to a person who had previously been married
and is purchasing as a single individual for the first time. The application for homestead benefits
must be on a form prescribed by the commissioner and must contain the data necessary for the
assessor to determine if full homestead benefits are warranted.
    (h) If residential or agricultural real estate is occupied and used for purposes of a homestead by
a child of a deceased owner and the property is subject to jurisdiction of probate court, the child
shall receive relative homestead classification under paragraph (c) or (d) to the same extent they
would be entitled to it if the owner was still living, until the probate is completed. For purposes of
this paragraph, "child" includes a relationship by blood or by marriage.
    (i) If a single-family home, duplex, or triplex classified as either residential homestead or
agricultural homestead is also used to provide licensed child care, the portion of the property used
for licensed child care must be classified as a part of the homestead property.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2009 and thereafter.
   Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 273.124, subdivision 14, as amended by
Laws 2008, chapter 154, article 2, section 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 14. Agricultural homesteads; special provisions. (a) Real estate of less than ten acres
that is the homestead of its owner must be classified as class 2a under section 273.13, subdivision
23, paragraph (a), if:
   (1) the parcel on which the house is located is contiguous on at least two sides to (i) agricultural
land, (ii) land owned or administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, or (iii) land
administered by the Department of Natural Resources on which in lieu taxes are paid under sections
477A.11 to 477A.14;
   (2) its owner also owns a noncontiguous parcel of agricultural land that is at least 20 acres;
    (3) the noncontiguous land is located not farther than four townships or cities, or a combination
of townships or cities from the homestead; and
   (4) the agricultural use value of the noncontiguous land and farm buildings is equal to at least
50 percent of the market value of the house, garage, and one acre of land.
    Homesteads initially classified as class 2a under the provisions of this paragraph shall remain
classified as class 2a, irrespective of subsequent changes in the use of adjoining properties, as long
as the homestead remains under the same ownership, the owner owns a noncontiguous parcel
of agricultural land that is at least 20 acres, and the agricultural use value qualifies under clause
119TH DAY]                           SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                        10977

(4). Homestead classification under this paragraph is limited to property that qualified under this

40's;
    (2) the owner, the owner's spouse, the son or daughter of the owner or owner's spouse, the brother
or sister of the owner or owner's spouse, or the grandson or granddaughter of the owner or the
owner's spouse, is actively farming the agricultural property, either on the person's own behalf as
an individual or on behalf of a partnership operating a family farm, family farm corporation, joint
family farm venture, or limited liability company of which the person is a partner, shareholder, or
member;
    (3) both the owner of the agricultural property and the person who is actively farming the
agricultural property under clause (2), are Minnesota residents;
   (4) neither the owner nor the spouse of the owner claims another agricultural homestead in
Minnesota; and
    (5) neither the owner nor the person actively farming the property lives farther than four
townships or cities, or a combination of four townships or cities, from the agricultural property,
except that if the owner or the owner's spouse is required to live in employer-provided housing,
the owner or owner's spouse, whichever is actively farming the agricultural property, may live
more than four townships or cities, or combination of four townships or cities from the agricultural
property.
   The relationship under this paragraph may be either by blood or marriage.
    (ii) Real property held by a trustee under a trust is eligible for agricultural homestead
classification under this paragraph if the qualifications in clause (i) are met, except that "owner"
means the grantor of the trust.

(i) shall be classified as part of the owner's agricultural homestead, if that property is also used for
noncommercial storage or drying of agricultural crops.
    (c) Noncontiguous land shall be included as part of a homestead under section 273.13,
subdivision 23, paragraph (a), only if the homestead is classified as class 2a and the detached land
is located in the same township or city, or not farther than four townships or cities or combination
thereof from the homestead. Any taxpayer of these noncontiguous lands must notify the county
assessor that the noncontiguous land is part of the taxpayer's homestead, and, if the homestead is
located in another county, the taxpayer must also notify the assessor of the other county.
    (d) Agricultural land used for purposes of a homestead and actively farmed by a person holding
a vested remainder interest in it must be classified as a homestead under section 273.13, subdivision
23, paragraph (a). If agricultural land is classified class 2a, any other dwellings on the land used for
purposes of a homestead by persons holding vested remainder interests who are actively engaged
in farming the property, and up to one acre of the land surrounding each homestead and reasonably
10978                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                               [119TH DAY

change in dwelling. Further notifications to the assessor are not required if the property continues
to meet all the requirements in this paragraph and any dwellings on the agricultural land remain
uninhabited.
   (f) Agricultural land and buildings that were class 2a homestead property under section
273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (a), for the 1998 assessment shall remain classified agricultural

agricultural homestead consists of class 2a agricultural land that is homesteaded, along with any
class 2b rural vacant land that is contiguous to the class 2a land under the same ownership. The
market value of the house and garage and immediately surrounding one acre of land has the same
class rates as class 1a or 1b property under subdivision 22. The value of the remaining land including
improvements up to the first tier valuation limit of agricultural homestead property has a net class
rate of 0
        ญญ5  5 0.5 percent of market value. The remaining property over the first tier has a class rate
          .ญ ญ
of one percent of market value. For purposes of this subdivision, the "first tier valuation limit of
agricultural homestead property" and "first tier" means the limit certified under section 273.11,
subdivision 23.
    (b) Class 2a agricultural land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
agricultural land and buildings. Class 2a property has a net class rate of one percent of market
value, unless it is part of an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a). Class 2a property may
contain property that would otherwise be classified as 2b, including but not limited to sloughs,
wooded wind shelters, acreage abutting ditches, and other similar land impractical for the assessor
to value separately from the rest of the property.
    An assessor may classify the part of a parcel described in this subdivision that is used for
agricultural purposes as class 2a and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use.

      cญ) (e) Agricultural land as used in this section means contiguous acreage of ten acres or more,
used during the preceding year for agricultural purposes. "Agricultural purposes" as used in this
section means the raising o             ญญr, cultivation, drying, or storage of agricultural products for sale, or
the storage of machinery or equipment used in support of agricultural production by the same
farm entity. For a property to be classified as agricultural based only on the drying or storage of
agricultural products, the products being dried or stored must have been produced by the same
farm entity as the entity operating the drying or storage facility. "Agricultural purposes" also
includes enrollment in the Reinvest in Minnesota program under sections 103F.501 to 103F.535 or
the federal Conservation Reserve Program as contained in Public Law 99-198 or a similar state or
federal conservation program if the property was classified as agricultural (i) under this subdivision
for the assessment year 2002 or (ii) in the year prior to its enrollment. C                                 ญo

and packaging of raw agricultural products for first sale is considered an agricultural purpose. A
greenhouse or other building where horticultural or nursery products are grown that is also used for
the conduct of retail sales must be classified as agricultural if it is primarily used for the growing
of horticultural or nursery products from seed, cuttings, or roots and occasionally as a showroom
for the retail sale of those products. Use of a greenhouse or building only for the display of already
grown horticultural or nursery products does not qualify as an agricultural purpose.
    The assessor shall determine and list separately on the records the market value of the
homestead dwelling and the one acre of land on which that dwelling is located. If any farm
buildings or structures are located on this homesteaded acre of land, their market value shall not be
included in this separate determination.

the property is located an affidavit containing:
    (1) a legal description of the property;
   (2) a disclosure that the property contains a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively
being mined but is present on the entire parcel enrolled;
   (3) documentation that the conditional use under the county or local zoning ordinance of this
property is for mining; and

The acres actively being mined must be (1) valued and classified under subdivision 24 in the next
subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource preservation property
tax program under section 273.1115, if the land was enrolled in that program. Copies of the
original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed with the county assessor, the local
zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Land and Minerals.
A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent portion of the property is actively
mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres, even if the actual mining activity
constitutes less than five acres.

    (1) nonhomestead residential real estate containing one unit, other than seasonal residential
recreational property; and
   (2) a single family dwelling, garage, and surrounding one acre of property on a nonhomestead
farm classified under subdivision 23, paragraph (b).
   Class 4bb property has the same class rates as class 1a property under subdivision 22.
    Property that has been classified as seasonal residential recreational property at any time during
which it has been owned by the current owner or spouse of the current owner does not qualify for
class 4bb.
   (d) Class 4c property includes:
    (1) except as provided in subdivision 22, paragraph (c), or subdivision 23, paragraph (b),
clause (1), real and personal property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy
for recreation purposes, including real and personal property devoted to temporary and seasonal
residential occupancy for recreation purposes and not devoted to commercial purposes for more
than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment. For purposes of this clause, property
is devoted to a commercial purpose on a specific day if any portion of the property is used
for residential occupancy, and a fee is charged for residential occupancy. Class 4c property
must contain three or more rental units. A "rental unit" is defined as a cabin, condominium,
townhouse, sleeping room, or individual camping site equipped with water and electrical hookups
for recreational vehicles. Class 4c property must provide recreational activities such as renting ice
fishing houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski equipment; provide
marina services, launch services, or guide services; or sell bait and fishing tackle. A camping
pad offered for rent by a property that otherwise qualifies for class 4c is also class 4c regardless
of the term of the rental agreement, as long as the use of the camping pad does not exceed 250
days. In order for a property to be classified as class 4c, seasonal residential recreational for
commercial purposes under this clause, at least 40 percent of the annual gross lodging receipts
related to the property must be from business conducted during 90 consecutive days and either (i)
at least 60 percent of all paid bookings by lodging guests during the year must be for periods of at

charges for rental of fish houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski
equipment, or charges for marina services, launch services, and guide services, or the sale of bait
and fishing tackle. For purposes of this determination, a paid booking of five or more nights shall
be counted as two bookings. Class 4c also includes commercial use real property used exclusively
for recreational purposes in conjunction with class 4c property devoted to temporary and seasonal
residential occupancy for recreational purposes, up to a total of two acres, provided the property is
not devoted to commercial recreational use for more than 250 days in the year preceding the year of
assessment and is located within two miles of the class 4c property with which it is used. Owners of
real and personal property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation
purposes and all or a portion of which was devoted to commercial purposes for not more than 250
days in the year preceding the year of assessment desiring classification as class 4c, must submit a
declaration to the assessor designating the cabins or units occupied for 250 days or less in the year
preceding the year of assessment by January 15 of the assessment year. Those cabins or units and a
proportionate share of the land on which they are located must be designated class 4c as otherwise

4c property must provide guest registers or other records demonstrating that the units for which
class 4c designation is sought were not occupied for more than 250 days in the year preceding

   (ii) it meets the requirements of section 273.112, subdivision 3, paragraph (d).
   A structure used as a clubhouse, restaurant, or place of refreshment in conjunction with the golf
course is classified as class 3a property;
   (3) real property up to a maximum of three acres of land owned and used by a nonprofit
community service oriented organization and that is not used for residential purposes on either a
temporary or permanent basis, qualifies for class 4c provided that it meets either of the following:
   (i) the property is not used for a revenue-producing activity for more than six days in the calendar
year preceding the year of assessment; or
   (ii) the organization makes annual charitable contributions and donations at least equal to the
property's previous year's property taxes and the property is allowed to be used for public and
community meetings or events for no charge, as appropriate to the size of the facility.
   For purposes of this clause,

assessments, fees, auditing costs, and utility payments;

the organization shall not be considered a revenue-producing activity.
     The organization shall maintain records of its charitable contributions and donations and of
public meetings and events held on the property and make them available upon request any time
to the assessor to ensure eligibility. An organization meeting the requirement under item (ii) must

3, only the proportion of qualifying units to the total number of units in the building qualify for class
4d. The remaining portion of the building shall be classified by the assessor based upon its use. Class
4d also includes the same proportion of land as the qualifying low-income rental housing units are to
the total units in the building. For all properties qualifying as class 4d, the market value determined
by the assessor must be based on the normal approach to value using normal unrestricted rents.

aggregate material is stored in a stockpile within the state of Minnesota and a public highway, road
or street is not used for transporting the aggregate material, the tax shall not be imposed until either
when the aggregate material is sold, or when it is transported from the stockpile site, or when it is
used from the stockpile, whichever occurs first.
    (b) A county that imposes the aggregate production tax under paragraph (a) shall impose upon
every importer a production tax of 21.5 cents per cubic yard or 15 cents per ton of aggregate material
imported into the county. The tax shall be imposed when the aggregate material is imported from the
extraction site or sold. When imported aggregate material is stored in a stockpile within the state of
Minnesota and a public highway, road, or street is not used for transporting the aggregate material,
the tax shall be imposed either when the aggregate material is sold, when it is transported from the
stockpile site, or when it is used from the stockpile, whichever occurs first. The tax shall be imposed
on an importer when the aggregate material is imported into the county that imposes the tax.
    (c) If the aggregate material is transported directly from the extraction site to a waterway, railway,
or another mode of transportation other than a highway, road or street, the tax imposed by this section
shall be apportioned equally between the county where the aggregate material is extracted and the
county to which the aggregate material is originally transported. If that destination is not located
in Minnesota, then the county where the aggregate material was extracted shall receive all of the
proceeds of the tax.
   (d) A county, city, or town that receives revenue under this section is prohibited from imposing
any additional host community fees on aggregate production within that county, city, or town.

individuals as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 12; and (2) nonpublic data as defined in section
13.02, subdivision 9. The names of the recipients of the financial assistance and the amounts of
financial assistance are public data.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 298.227, is amended to read:
   298.227 TACONITE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUND.
    (a) An amount equal to that distributed pursuant to each taconite producer's taxable production
and qualifying sales under section 298.28, subdivision 9a, shall be held by the Iron Range Resources
and Rehabilitation Board in a separate taconite economic development fund for each taconite
and direct reduced ore producer. Money from the fund for each producer shall be released by the
commissioner after review by a joint committee consisting of an equal number of representatives
of the salaried employees and the nonsalaried production and maintenance employees of that
producer. The District 11 director of the United States Steelworkers of America, on advice of each
local employee president, shall select the employee members. In nonorganized operations, the
employee committee shall be elected by the nonsalaried production and maintenance employees.
The review must be completed no later than six months after the producer presents a proposal
for expenditure of the funds to the committee. The funds held pursuant to this section may be
released only for workforce development and associated public facility improvement, or for
acquisition of plant and stationary mining equipment and facilities for the producer or for research
and development in Minnesota on new mining, or taconite, iron, or steel production technology,
but only if the producer provides a matching expenditure to be used for the same purpose of at
least 50 percent of the distribution based on 14.7 cents per ton beginning with distributions in
2002. Effective for proposals for expenditures of money from the fund beginning May 26, 2007,
the commissioner may not release the funds before the next scheduled meeting of the board. If the
board rejects a proposed expenditure, the funds must be deposited in the Taconite Environmental
Protection Fund under sections 298.222 to 298.225. If a producer uses money which has been
released from the fund prior to May 26, 2007 to procure haulage trucks, mobile equipment, or
mining shovels, and the producer removes the piece of equipment from the taconite tax relief area
defined in section 273.134 within ten years from the date of receipt of the money from the fund, a
portion of the money granted from the fund must be repaid to the taconite economic development
fund. The portion of the money to be repaid is 100 percent of the grant if the equipment is removed
from the taconite tax relief area within 12 months after receipt of the money from the fund,
declining by ten percent for each of the subsequent nine years during which the equipment remains
within the taconite tax relief area. If a taconite production facility is sold after operations at the
facility had ceased, any money remaining in the fund for the former producer may be released to
the purchaser of the facility on the terms otherwise applicable to the former producer under this
section. If a producer fails to provide matching funds for a proposed expenditure within six months
after the commissioner approves release of the funds, the funds are available for release to another
producer in proportion to the distribution provided and under the conditions of this section. Any
portion of the fund which is not released by the commissioner within ญw     tญo

deposit in the fund shall be divided between the taconite environmental protection fund created
in section 298.223 and the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund created in section
298.292 for placement in their respective special accounts. Two-thirds of the unreleased funds
shall be distributed to the taconite environmental protection fund and one-third to the Douglas J.

Johnson economic protection trust fund.
    (b) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a), setting the amount of distributions
and the review process, an amount equal to ten cents per taxable ton of production in 2007, for
distribution in 2008 only, that would otherwise be distributed under paragraph (a), may be used
for a loan for the cost of construction of a biomass energy facility. This amount must be deducted
from the distribution under paragraph (a) for which a matching expenditure by the producer
is not required. The granting of the loan is subject to approval by the Iron Range Resources
and Rehabilitation Board; interest must be payable on the loan at the rate prescribed in section
298.2213, subdivision 3. Repayments of the loan and interest must be deposited in the northeast
Minnesota economic development fund established in section 298.2213. If a loan is not made
under this paragraph by July 1, 2009, the amount that had been made available for the loan under
this paragraph must be transferred to the northeast Minnesota economic development fund. Money
distributed in 2008 to the fund established under this section that exceeds ten cents per ton is
available to qualifying producers under paragraph (a) on a pro rata basis.
    If 2008 H.F. No. 1812 is enacted and includes a provision that amends this section in a manner
that is different from the amendment in this section, the amendment in this section supersedes the
amendment in 2008 H.F. No. 1812, notwithstanding section 645.26.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. The section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 298.24, subdivision 1, as amended by Laws 2008,
chapter 154, article 8, section 5, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Imposed; calculation. (a) For concentrate produced in 2001, 2002, and 2003,
there is imposed upon taconite and iron sulphides, and upon the mining and quarrying thereof, and
upon the production of iron ore concentrate therefrom, and upon the concentrate so produced, a tax
of $2.103 per gross ton of merchantable iron ore concentrate produced therefrom. For concentrates
produced in 2005, the tax rate is the same rate imposed for concentrates produced in 2004. For
concentrates produced in 2009 and subsequent years, the tax is also imposed upon other iron bearing
material.
    (b) For concentrates produced in 2006 and subsequent years, the tax rate shall be equal to the
preceding year's tax rate plus an amount equal to the preceding year's tax rate multiplied by the
percentage increase in the implicit price deflator from the fourth quarter of the second preceding
year to the fourth quarter of the preceding year. "Implicit price deflator" means the implicit price
deflator for the gross domestic product prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United
States Department of Commerce.

cents per gross ton of merchantable iron ore concentrate for each one percent that the iron content
of the product exceeds 72 percent, when dried at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
    (d) The tax on taconite and iron sulphides shall be imposed on the average of the production for
the current year and the previous two years. The rate of the tax imposed will be the current year's
tax rate. This clause shall not apply in the case of the closing of a taconite facility if the property
taxes on the facility would be higher if this clause and section 298.25 were not applicable. The tax
on other iron bearing material shall be imposed on the current year production.
119TH DAY]                              SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                            11027

    (e) If the tax or any part of the tax imposed by this subdivision is held to be unconstitutional, a
tax of $2.103 per gross ton of merchantable iron ore concentrate produced shall be imposed.
    (f) Consistent with the intent of this subdivision to impose a tax based upon the weight of
merchantable iron ore concentrate, the commissioner of revenue may indirectly determine the
weight of merchantable iron ore concentrate included in fluxed pellets by subtracting the weight of
the limestone, dolomite, or olivine derivatives or other basic flux additives included in the pellets
from the weight of the pellets. For purposes of this paragraph, "fluxed pellets" are pellets produced
in a process in which limestone, dolomite, olivine, or other basic flux additives are combined with
merchantable iron ore concentrate. No subtraction from the weight of the pellets shall be allowed
for binders, mineral and chemical additives other than basic flux additives, or moisture.
    (g)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, for the first two years of a plant's
commercial production of direct reduced ore from ore mined in this state, no tax is imposed under
this section. As used in this paragraph, "commercial production" is production of more than 50,000
tons of direct reduced ore in the current year or in any prior year, "noncommercial production"
is production of 50,000 tons or less of direct reduced ore in any year, and "direct reduced ore" is
ore that results in a product that has an iron content of at least 75 percent. For the third year of
a plant's commercial production of direct reduced ore, the rate to be applied to direct reduced ore
is 25 percent of the rate otherwise determined under this subdivision. For the fourth commercial
production year, the rate is 50 percent of the rate otherwise determined under this subdivision; for
the fifth commercial production year, the rate is 75 percent of the rate otherwise determined under
this subdivision; and for all subsequent commercial production years, the full rate is imposed.
    (2) Subject to clause (1), production of direct reduced ore in this state is subject to the tax imposed
by this section, but if that production is not produced by a producer of taconite ญ        r, iron sulfides, or
                                                                                          oญ
other iron bearing material, the production of taconite o   r, iron sulfides, or other iron bearing material,
                                                           ญญ
that is consumed in the production of direct reduced iron in this state is not subject to the tax imposed
by this section on taconite o  r, iron sulfides, or other iron bearing material.
                              ญญ
    (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, no tax is imposed on direct reduced
ore under this section during the facility's noncommercial production of direct reduced ore. The
taconite or iron sulphides consumed in the noncommercial production of direct reduced ore is subject
to the tax imposed by this section on taconite and iron sulphides. Three-year average production of
direct reduced ore does not include production of direct reduced ore in any noncommercial year.
Three-year average production for a direct reduced ore facility that has noncommercial production is
the average of the commercial production of direct reduced ore for the current year and the previous
two commercial years.
   (4) This paragraph applies only to plants for which all environmental permits have been obtained
and construction has begun before July 1, 2008.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for production in 2009 and thereafter, except that
the amendment to paragraph (g) is effective the day following final enactment.

     This section does not provide an exemption from general property taxation for ore docks even
if located at the site of a taconite production facility.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for production in 2009 and thereafter.
    Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 298.28, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Cities; towns. (a) 12.5 cents per taxable ton, less any amount distributed under
subdivision 8, and paragraph (b), must be allocated to the taconite municipal aid account to be
distributed as provided in section 298.282.
    (b) An amount must be allocated to towns or cities that is annually certified by the county auditor
of a county containing a taconite tax relief area as defined in section 273.134, paragraph (b), within
which there is (1) an organized township if, as of January 2, 1982, more than 75 percent of the
assessed valuation of the township consists of iron ore or (2) a city if, as of January 2, 1980, more
than 75 percent of the assessed valuation of the city consists of iron ore.
   (c) The amount allocated under paragraph (b) will be the portion of a township's or city's certified
levy equal to the proportion of (1) the difference between 50 percent of January 2, 1982, assessed

value in the case of a township and 50 percent of the January 2, 1980, assessed value in the case of
a city and its current assessed value to (2) the sum of its current assessed value plus the difference
determined in (1), provided that the amount distributed shall not exceed $55 per capita in the case
of a township or $75 per capita in the case of a city. For purposes of this limitation, population
will be determined according to the 1980 decennial census conducted by the United States Bureau
of the Census. If the current assessed value of the township exceeds 50 percent of the township's
January 2, 1982, assessed value, or if the current assessed value of the city exceeds 50 percent of the
city's January 2, 1980, assessed value, this paragraph shall not apply. For purposes of this paragraph,
"assessed value," when used in reference to years other than 1980 or 1982, means the appropriate
net tax capacities multiplied by 10.2.
    (d) In addition to other distributions under this subdivision, three cents per taxable ton for
distributions in 2009 must be allocated for distribution to towns that are entirely located within
the taconite tax relief area defined in section 273.134, paragraph (b). For distribution in 2010 and
subsequent years, the three-cent amount must be annually increased in the same proportion as the
increase in the implicit price deflator as provided in section 298.24, subdivision 1. The amount
available under this paragraph will be distributed to eligible towns on a per capita basis, provided
that no town may receive more than $50,000 in any year under this paragraph. Any amount of
the distribution that exceeds the $50,000 limitation for a town under this paragraph must be
redistributed on a per capita basis among the other eligible towns, to whose distributions do not
exceed $50,000.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for distributions in 2009 and thereafter.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 298.28, subdivision 9d, as added by Laws 2008, chapter

allocated to the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board to be deposited in an Iron Range
higher education account that is hereby created, to be used for higher education programs conducted

Range Higher Education committee under section 298.2214 and the Iron Range Resources and
Rehabilitation Board must approve all expenditures from the account.

   Subd. 2. Use of money. Money in the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund may
be used for the following purposes:
    (1) to provide loans, loan guarantees, interest buy-downs and other forms of participation with
private sources of financing, but a loan to a private enterprise shall be for a principal amount not
to exceed one-half of the cost of the project for which financing is sought, and the rate of interest
on a loan to a private enterprise shall be no less than the lesser of eight percent or an interest rate
three percentage points less than a full faith and credit obligation of the United States government
of comparable maturity, at the time that the loan is approved;
    (2) to fund reserve accounts established to secure the payment when due of the principal of and
interest on bonds issued pursuant to section 298.2211;
    (3) to pay in periodic payments or in a lump sum payment any or all of the interest on bonds
issued pursuant to chapter 474 for the purpose of constructing, converting, or retrofitting heating
facilities in connection with district heating systems or systems utilizing alternative energy sources;
     (4) to invest in a venture capital fund or enterprise that will provide capital to other entities that
are engaging in, or that will engage in, projects or programs that have the purposes set forth in
subdivision 1. No investments may be made in a venture capital fund or enterprise unless at least
two other unrelated investors make investments of at least $500,000 in the venture capital fund or
enterprise, and the investment by the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund may not
exceed the amount of the largest investment by an unrelated investor in the venture capital fund or
enterprise. For purposes of this subdivision, an "unrelated investor" is a person or entity that is not
related to the entity in which the investment is made or to any individual who owns more than 40
percent of the value of the entity, in any of the following relationships: spouse, parent, child, sibling,
employee, or owner of an interest in the entity that exceeds ten percent of the value of all interests
in it. For purposes of determining the limitations under this clause, the amount of investments made
by an investor other than the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund is the sum of all
investments made in the venture capital fund or enterprise during the period beginning one year
before the date of the investment by the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund; and

   Sec. 14. ELECTRIC GENERATING PLANTS IN TACONITE TAX RELIEF AREAS.
    For purposes of definitions of "taconite tax relief area" and "taconite assistance area" in
Minnesota Statutes, sections 273.134, 273.1341, and related laws, the elimination of the property
tax exemption for certain electric generating plants under Laws 2008, chapter 154, article 8, section
6, does not change the status of any electric generating plant qualifying as a taconite facility.
   Sec. 15. 2008 DISTRIBUTIONS ONLY.
    For distribution in 2008 only, a special fund is established to receive 11.4 cents per ton that
otherwise would be allocated under Minnesota Statutes, section 298.28, subdivision 6. If sufficient
funds are not available under Minnesota Statutes, section 298.28, subdivision 6, to make the
payments required under this section and under Minnesota Statutes, section 298.28, subdivision
6, the remaining amount needed to total 11.4 cents per ton may be taken from funds available
under Minnesota Statutes, section 298.28, subdivision 9. If 2008 H.F. No. 1812 is enacted and
includes a provision that distributes funds that would otherwise be allocated under Minnesota
Statutes, section 298.28, subdivision 6, in a manner different from the distribution required in
this section, the distribution in this section supersedes the distribution set in 2008 H.F. No. 1812
notwithstanding Minnesota Statutes, section 645.26. The following amounts are allocated to St.
Louis County acting as the fiscal agent for the recipients for the following specified purposes:
   (1) two cents per ton must be paid to the Hibbing Economic Development Authority to retire
bonds and for economic development purposes;
    (2) one cent per ton must be divided among and paid in equal shares to each of the board of
St. Louis County School District No. 2142, the board of Ely School District No. 696, the board of
Mountain Iron-Buhl School District No. 712, and the board of Virginia School District No. 706 for
each to study the potential for and impact of consolidation and streamlining the operations of their
school districts;
   (3) 0.25 cent per ton must be paid to the city of Grand Rapids, for industrial park work;
   (4) 0.65 cent per ton must be paid to the city of Aitkin, for sewer and water for housing projects;
   (5) 0.5 cent per ton must be paid to the city of Crosby, for well and water tower infrastructure;
    (6) 0.5 cent per ton must be paid to the city of Two Harbors, for well and water tower
infrastructure;
    (7) 1.5 cents per ton must be paid to the city of Silver Bay to pay for health and safety and
maintenance improvements at a former elementary school building that is currently owned by the
city, to be used for economic development purposes;
    (8) 1.5 cents per ton must be paid to St. Louis County to extend water and sewer lines from the
city of Chisholm to the St. Louis County fairgrounds;
   (9) 1.5 cents per ton must be paid to the White Community Hospital for debt restructuring;
   (10) 0.5 cent per ton must be paid to the city of Keewatin for street, sewer, and water
improvements;

   (11) 0.5 cent per ton must be paid to the city of Calumet for street, sewer, and water
improvements; and
    (12) one cent per ton must be paid to Breitung township for sewer and water extensions
associated with the development of a state park, provided that if a new state park is not established
in Breitung township by July 1, 2009, the money provided in this clause must be transferred to
the northeast Minnesota economic development fund established in Minnesota Statutes, section
298.2213.
   Sec. 16. REPEALER.
   Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 298.405, subdivisions 2, 3, and 4, are repealed.

  (a) The articles of incorporation set the sale price of occupancy entitling cooperative shares or
memberships at no more than a transfer value determined as provided in the articles. That value
may not exceed the sum of the following:
    (1) the consideration paid for the membership or shares by the first occupant of the unit, as shown
in the records of the corporation;
    (2) the fair market value, as shown in the records of the corporation, of any improvements to the
real property that were installed at the sole expense of the member with the prior approval of the
board of directors;
   (3) accumulated interest, or an inflation allowance not to exceed the greater of a ten percent
annual noncompounded increase on the consideration paid for the membership or share by the first
occupant of the unit, or the amount that would have been paid on that consideration if interest had
been paid on it at the rate of the percentage increase in the revised Consumer Price Index for All
Urban Consumers for the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area prepared by the United States
Department of Labor, provided that the amount determined pursuant to this clause may not exceed
$500 for each year or fraction of a year the membership or share was owned; plus
    (4) real property capital contributions shown in the records of the corporation to have been
paid by the transferor member and previous holders of the same membership, or of separate
memberships that had entitled occupancy to the unit of the member involved. These contributions
include contributions to a corporate reserve account the use of which is restricted to real property
improvements or acquisitions, contributions to the corporation which are used for real property
improvements or acquisitions, and the amount of principal amortized by the corporation on its
indebtedness due to the financing of real property acquisition or improvement or the averaging of
principal paid by the corporation over the term of its real property-related indebtedness.
    (b) The articles of incorporation require that the board of directors limit the purchase price of
stock or membership interests for new member-occupants or resident shareholders to an amount
which does not exceed the transfer value for the membership or stock as defined in clause (a).
   (c) The articles of incorporation require that the total distribution out of capital to a member
shall not exceed that transfer value.
    (d) The articles of incorporation require that upon liquidation of the corporation any assets
remaining after retirement of corporate debts and distribution to members will be conveyed to a
charitable organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code ญ oญ

of the property, the governing body of the municipality in which the property is located must hold
a public hearing and make the following findings:
    (1) that the granting of the homestead treatment of the apartment's units will facilitate safe, clean,
affordable housing for the cooperative members that would otherwise not be available absent the
homestead designation;
    (2) that the owner has presented information satisfactory to the governing body showing that the
savings garnered from the homestead designation of the units will be used to reduce tenant's rents
or provide a level of furnishing or maintenance not possible absent the designation; and
   (3) that the requirements of paragraphs (b), (d), and (i) have been met.
    Homestead treatment must be afforded to units occupied by members of the cooperative
association and the units must be assessed as provided in subdivision 3, provided that any unit not
so occupied shall be classified and assessed pursuant to the appropriate class. No more than three
acres of land may, for assessment purposes, be included with each dwelling unit that qualifies for
homestead treatment under this subdivision.
     When dwelling units no longer qualify under this subdivision, the current owner must notify the
assessor within 60 days. Failure to notify the assessor within 60 days shall result in the loss of benefits
under this subdivision for taxes payable in the year that the failure is discovered. For these purposes,
"benefits under this subdivision" means the difference in the net tax capacity of the units which no
longer qualify as computed under this subdivision and as computed under the otherwise applicable
law, times the local tax rate applicable to the building for that taxes payable year. Upon discovery of
a failure to notify, the assessor shall inform the auditor of the difference in net tax capacity for the
building or buildings in which units no longer qualify, and the auditor shall calculate the benefits
under this subdivision. Such amount, plus a penalty equal to 100 percent of that amount, shall then
be demanded of the building's owner. The property owner may appeal the county's determination
by serving copies of a petition for review with county officials as provided in section 278.01 and
filing a proof of service as provided in section 278.01 with the Minnesota Tax Court within 60 days
of the date of the notice from the county. The appeal shall be governed by the Tax Court procedures
provided in chapter 271, for cases relating to the tax laws as defined in section 271.01, subdivision 5;
disregarding sections 273.125, subdivision 5, and 278.03, but including section 278.05, subdivision
2. If the amount of the benefits under this subdivision and penalty are not paid within 60 days, and
if no appeal has been filed, the county auditor shall certify the amount of the benefit and penalty to
the succeeding year's tax list to be collected as part of the property taxes on the affected buildings.

for recreational vehicles. Class 4c property must provide recreational activities such as renting ice
fishing houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski equipment; provide
marina services, launch services, or guide services; or sell bait and fishing tackle. A camping pad

of this determination, a paid booking of five or more nights shall be counted as two bookings.
Class 4c also includes commercial use real property used exclusively for recreational purposes
in conjunction with class 4c property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy
for recreational purposes, up to a total of two acres, provided the property is not devoted to
commercial recreational use for more than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment
and is located within two miles of the class 4c property with which it is used. Owners of real and
personal property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes
and all or a portion of which was devoted to commercial purposes for not more than 250 days
in the year preceding the year of assessment desiring classification as class 4c, must submit a
declaration to the assessor designating the cabins or units occupied for 250 days or less in the year
preceding the year of assessment by January 15 of the assessment year. Those cabins or units and a

The credit shall equal 2.5 percent of revenues for patient services used to fund expenditures for

of the gasoline or special fuel, or otherwise, shall be reimbursed and repaid the amount of the tax
paid upon filing with the commissioner a claim for refund in the form and manner prescribed by
the commissioner, and containing the information the commissioner shall require. By signing any
such claim which is false or fraudulent, the applicant shall be subject to the penalties provided
in this chapter for knowingly making a false claim. The claim shall set forth the total amount of
the gasoline so purchased and used by the applicant other than in motor vehicles, or special fuel
purchased and used by the applicant other than in licensed motor vehicles, and shall state when and
for what purpose it was used. When a claim contains an error in computation or preparation, the

income and gains therefrom shall be made with reference to the trade or business of the affiliated
corporation having a nexus with Minnesota.
    (e) The deduction provided by this subdivision does not apply if the dividends are paid by a FSC

(ii) as the case may be.
    (c) The provisions of section 3406 of the Internal Revenue Code shall apply and shall govern

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.124, subdivision 13, as amended by Laws 2008,
chapter 154, article 13, section 29, is amended to read:
   Subd. 13. Homestead application. (a) A person who meets the homestead requirements
under subdivision 1 must file a homestead application with the county assessor to initially obtain
homestead classification.
    (b) The format and contents of a uniform homestead application shall be prescribed by the
commissioner of revenue. The application must clearly inform the taxpayer that this application
must be signed by all owners who occupy the property or by the qualifying relative and returned to
the county assessor in order for the property to receive homestead treatment.
    (c) Every property owner applying for homestead classification must furnish to the county
assessor the Social Security number of each occupant who is listed as an owner of the property
on the deed of record, the name and address of each owner who does not occupy the property,
and the name and Social Security number of each owner's spouse who occupies the property.
The application must be signed by each owner who occupies the property and by each owner's
spouse who occupies the property, or, in the case of property that qualifies as a homestead under
subdivision 1, paragraph (c), by the qualifying relative.
    If a property owner occupies a homestead, the property owner's spouse may not claim another
property as a homestead unless the property owner and the property owner's spouse file with the
assessor an affidavit or other proof required by the assessor stating that the property qualifies as a
homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (e).
    Owners or spouses occupying residences owned by their spouses and previously occupied with
the other spouse, either of whom fail to include the other spouse's name and Social Security number
on the homestead application or provide the affidavits or other proof requested, will be deemed
to have elected to receive only partial homestead treatment of their residence. The remainder of
the residence will be classified as nonhomestead residential. When an owner or spouse's name and
Social Security number appear on homestead applications for two separate residences and only one
application is signed, the owner or spouse will be deemed to have elected to homestead the residence
for which the application was signed.
    The Social Security numbers, state or federal tax returns or tax return information, including the
federal income tax schedule F required by this section, or affidavits or other proofs of the property
owners and spouses,  ญ

the Revenue Recapture Act to recover personal property taxes owing, to the county treasurer.

of the owner and qualifies for a homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (c), in order for the
property to receive homestead status, a homestead application must be filed with the assessor. The
Social Security number of each relative and spouse of a relative occupying the property shall be
required on the homestead application filed under this subdivision. If a different relative of the
owner subsequently occupies the property, the owner of the property must notify the assessor within
30 days of the change in occupancy. The Social Security number of a relative or relative's spouse
occupying the property is private data on individuals as defined by section 13.02, subdivision 12,
but may be disclosed to the commissioner of revenue, or, for the purposes of proceeding under the
Revenue Recapture Act to recover personal property taxes owing, to the county treasurer.
    (e) The homestead application shall also notify the property owners that the application filed
under this section will not be mailed annually and that if the property is granted homestead status
for any assessment year, that same property shall remain classified as homestead until the property
is sold or transferred to another person, or the owners, the spouse of the owner, or the relatives no
longer use the property as their homestead. Upon the sale or transfer of the homestead property, a
certificate of value must be timely filed with the county auditor as provided under section 272.115.
Failure to notify the assessor within 30 days that the property has been sold, transferred, or that the
owner, the spouse of the owner, or the relative is no longer occupying the property as a homestead,
shall result in the penalty provided under this subdivision and the property will lose its current
homestead status.
    (f) If the homestead application is not returned within 30 days, the county will send a second
application to the present owners of record. The notice of proposed property taxes prepared under
section 275.065, subdivision 3, shall reflect the property's classification. If a homestead application
has not been filed with the county by December 15, the assessor shall classify the property as
nonhomestead for the current assessment year for taxes payable in the following year, provided
that the owner may be entitled to receive the homestead classification by proper application under
section 375.192.
    (g) At the request of the commissioner, each county must give the commissioner a list that
includes the name and Social Security number of each occupant of homestead property who is the
property owner, property owner's spouse, qualifying relative of a property owner, or a spouse of a
qualifying relative. The commissioner shall use the information provided on the lists as appropriate
under the law, including for the detection of improper claims by owners, or relatives of owners,
under chapter 290A.
     (h) If the commissioner finds that a property owner may be claiming a fraudulent homestead,
the commissioner shall notify the appropriate counties. Within 90 days of the notification, the
county assessor shall investigate to determine if the homestead classification was properly claimed.
If the property owner does not qualify, the county assessor shall notify the county auditor who will
determine the amount of homestead benefits that had been improperly allowed. For the purpose
of this section, "homestead benefits" means the tax reduction resulting from the classification
as a homestead under section 273.13, the taconite homestead credit under section 273.135,
the residential homestead and agricultural homestead credits under section 273.1384, and the
supplemental homestead credit under section 273.1391.
    The county auditor shall send a notice to the person who owned the affected property at the time
the homestead application related to the improper homestead was filed, demanding reimbursement
of the homestead benefits plus a penalty equal to 100 percent of the homestead benefits. The person

notified may appeal the county's determination by serving copies of a petition for review with county
officials as provided in section 278.01 and filing proof of service as provided in section 278.01 with
the Minnesota Tax Court within 60 days of the date of the notice from the county. Procedurally,
the appeal is governed by the provisions in chapter 271 which apply to the appeal of a property
tax assessment or levy, but without requiring any prepayment of the amount in controversy. If the
amount of homestead benefits and penalty is not paid within 60 days, and if no appeal has been
filed, the county auditor shall certify the amount of taxes and penalty to the county treasurer. The
county treasurer will add interest to the unpaid homestead benefits and penalty amounts at the rate
provided in section 279.03 for real property taxes becoming delinquent in the calendar year during
which the amount remains unpaid. Interest may be assessed for the period beginning 60 days after
demand for payment was made.
    If the person notified is the current owner of the property, the treasurer may add the total amount
of homestead benefits, penalty, interest, and costs to the ad valorem taxes otherwise payable on the
property by including the amounts on the property tax statements under section 276.04, subdivision
3. The amounts added under this paragraph to the ad valorem taxes shall include interest accrued
through December 31 of the year preceding the taxes payable year for which the amounts are first
added. These amounts, when added to the property tax statement, become subject to all the laws for
the enforcement of real or personal property taxes for that year, and for any subsequent year.
    If the person notified is not the current owner of the property, the treasurer may collect the
amounts due under the Revenue Recapture Act in chapter 270A, or use any of the powers granted
in sections 277.20 and 277.21 without exclusion, to enforce payment of the homestead benefits,
penalty, interest, and costs, as if those amounts were delinquent tax obligations of the person who
owned the property at the time the application related to the improperly allowed homestead was
filed. The treasurer may relieve a prior owner of personal liability for the homestead benefits, penalty,
interest, and costs, and instead extend those amounts on the tax lists against the property as provided
in this paragraph to the extent that the current owner agrees in writing. On all demands, billings,
property tax statements, and related correspondence, the county must list and state separately the
amounts of homestead benefits, penalty, interest and costs being demanded, billed or assessed.
    (i) Any amount of homestead benefits recovered by the county from the property owner shall be
distributed to the county, city or town, and school district where the property is located in the same
proportion that each taxing district's levy was to the total of the three taxing districts' levy for the
current year. Any amount recovered attributable to taconite homestead credit shall be transmitted
to the St. Louis County auditor to be deposited in the taconite property tax relief account. Any
amount recovered that is attributable to supplemental homestead credit is to be transmitted to the
commissioner of revenue for deposit in the general fund of the state treasury. The total amount of
penalty collected must be deposited in the county general fund.
    (j) If a property owner has applied for more than one homestead and the county assessors cannot
determine which property should be classified as homestead, the county assessors will refer the
information to the commissioner. The commissioner shall make the determination and notify the
counties within 60 days.
     (k) In addition to lists of homestead properties, the commissioner may ask the counties to furnish
lists of all properties and the record owners. The Social Security numbers and federal identification
numbers that are maintained by a county or city assessor for property tax administration purposes,
and that may appear on the lists retain their classification as private or nonpublic data; but may be

viewed, accessed, and used by the county auditor or treasurer of the same county for the limited
purpose of assisting the commissioner in the preparation of microdata samples under section
270C.12.
    (l) On or before April 30 each year beginning in 2007, each county must provide the
commissioner with the following data for each parcel of homestead property by electronic means
as defined in section 289A.02, subdivision 8:
    (i) the property identification number assigned to the parcel for purposes of taxes payable in the
current year;
   (ii) the name and Social Security number of each occupant of homestead property who is the
property owner, property owner's spouse, qualifying relative of a property owner, or spouse of a
qualifying relative;
   (iii) the classification of the property under section 273.13 for taxes payable in the current year
and in the prior year;
    (iv) an indication of whether the property was classified as a homestead for taxes payable in the
current year because of occupancy by a relative of the owner or by a spouse of a relative;
   (v) the property taxes payable as defined in section 290A.03, subdivision 13, for the current year
and the prior year;
   (vi) the market value of improvements to the property first assessed for tax purposes for taxes
payable in the current year;
    (vii) the assessor's estimated market value assigned to the property for taxes payable in the
current year and the prior year;
    (viii) the taxable market value assigned to the property for taxes payable in the current year and
the prior year;
   (ix) whether there are delinquent property taxes owing on the homestead;
   (x) the unique taxing district in which the property is located; and
   (xi) such other information as the commissioner decides is necessary.
    The commissioner shall use the information provided on the lists as appropriate under the law,
including for the detection of improper claims by owners, or relatives of owners, under chapter
290A.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.124, subdivision 21, is amended to read:
    Subd. 21. Trust property; homestead. Real property held by a trustee under a trust is eligible
for classification as homestead property if:
   (1) the grantor or surviving spouse of the grantor of the trust occupies and uses the property as
a homestead;
   (2) a relative or surviving relative of the grantor who meets the requirements of subdivision 1,

as that person's homestead and who continues to use the property as a homestead or a person who
received the homestead classification for taxes payable in 2005 under clause (3) who does not qualify

exercise of a power of appointment.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.13, subdivision 22, as amended by Laws 2008,
chapter 154, article 2, section 11, is amended to read:
    Subd. 22. Class 1. (a) Except as provided in subdivision 23 and in paragraphs (b) and (c), real
estate which is residential and used for homestead purposes is class 1a. In the case of a duplex or
triplex in which one of the units is used for homestead purposes, the entire property is deemed to
be used for homestead purposes. The market value of class 1a property must be determined based
upon the value of the house, garage, and land.
   The first $500,000 of market value of class 1a property has a net class rate of one percent of its
market value; and the market value of class 1a property that exceeds $500,000 has a class rate of
1.25 percent of its market value.
    (b) Class 1b property includes homestead real estate or homestead manufactured homes used
for the purposes of a homestead by
   (1) any person who is blind as defined in section 256D.35, or the blind person and the blind
person's spouse; ญ
                 oญr
   (2) any person who is permanently and totally disabled or by the disabled person and the disabled
person's spouse.
               ญ; or
    (3) the surviving spouse of a permanently and totally disabled veteran homesteading a property
classified under this paragraph for taxes payable in 2008.
     Property is classified and assessed under clause (2) only if the government agency or
119TH DAY]                           SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                       11073

income-providing source certifies, upon the request of the homestead occupant, that the homestead
occupant satisfies the disability requirements of this paragraph, and that the property is not eligible
for the valuation exclusion under subdivision 34.
    Property is classified and assessed under paragraph (b) only if the commissioner of revenue or
the county assessor certifies that the homestead occupant satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.
    Permanently and totally disabled for the purpose of this subdivision means a condition which
is permanent in nature and totally incapacitates the person from working at an occupation which
brings the person an income. The first $50,000 market value of class 1b property has a net class rate
of .45 percent of its market value. The remaining market value of class 1b property has a class rate
using the rates for class 1a or class 2a property, whichever is appropriate, of similar market value.
     (c) Class 1c property is commercial use real and personal property that abuts public water as
defined in section 103G.005, subdivision 15, and is devoted to temporary and seasonal residential
occupancy for recreational purposes but not devoted to commercial purposes for more than 250
days in the year preceding the year of assessment, and that includes a portion used as a homestead
by the owner, which includes a dwelling occupied as a homestead by a shareholder of a corporation
that owns the resort, a partner in a partnership that owns the resort, or a member of a limited
liability company that owns the resort even if the title to the homestead is held by the corporation,
partnership, or limited liability company. For purposes of this clause, property is devoted to a
commercial purpose on a specific day if any portion of the property, excluding the portion used
exclusively as a homestead, is used for residential occupancy and a fee is charged for residential
occupancy. Class 1c property must contain three or more rental units. A "rental unit" is defined
as a cabin, condominium, townhouse, sleeping room, or individual camping site equipped with
water and electrical hookups for recreational vehicles. Class 1c property must provide recreational
activities such as the rental of ice fishing houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or
cross-country ski equipment; provide marina services, launch services, or guide services; or
sell bait and fishing tackle. Any unit in which the right to use the property is transferred to an
individual or entity by deeded interest, or the sale of shares or stock, no longer qualifies for class
1c even though it may remain available for rent. A camping pad offered for rent by a property that
otherwise qualifies for class 1c is also class 1c, regardless of the term of the rental agreement, as
long as the use of the camping pad does not exceed 250 days. The portion of the property used as
a homestead is class 1a property under paragraph (a). The remainder of the property is classified
as follows: the first $600,000 of market value is tier I, the next $1,700,000 of market value is tier
II, and any remaining market value is tier III. The class rates for class 1c are: tier I, 0.50 percent;
tier II, 1.0 percent; and tier III, 1.25 percent. Owners of real and personal property devoted to
temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes in which all or a portion of
the property was devoted to commercial purposes for not more than 250 days in the year preceding
the year of assessment desiring classification as class 1c, must submit a declaration to the assessor
designating the cabins or units occupied for 250 days or less in the year preceding the year of
assessment by January 15 of the assessment year. Those cabins or units and a proportionate share
of the land on which they are located must be designated as class 1c as otherwise provided. The
remainder of the cabins or units and a proportionate share of the land on which they are located
must be designated as class 3a commercial. The owner of property desiring designation as class
1c property must provide guest registers or other records demonstrating that the units for which
class 1c designation is sought were not occupied for more than 250 days in the year preceding
the assessment if so requested. The portion of a property operated as a (1) restaurant, (2) bar, (3)

gift shop, (4) conference center or meeting room, and (5) other nonresidential facility operated
on a commercial basis not directly related to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for
recreation purposes does not qualify for class 1c.
      (d) Class 1d property includes structures that meet all of the following criteria:
   (1) the structure is located on property that is classified as agricultural property under section
273.13, subdivision 23;
   (2) the structure is occupied exclusively by seasonal farm workers during the time when they
work on that farm, and the occupants are not charged rent for the privilege of occupying the property,
provided that use of the structure for storage of farm equipment and produce does not disqualify the
property from classification under this paragraph;
      (3) the structure meets all applicable health and safety requirements for the appropriate season;
and
   (4) the structure is not salable as residential property because it does not comply with local
ordinances relating to location in relation to streets or roads.
   The market value of class 1d property has the same class rates as class 1a property under
paragraph (a).
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2009 and thereafter.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.13, subdivision 34, as added by Laws 2008,
chapter 154, article 2, section 14, is amended to read:
    Subd. 34. Homestead of disabled veteran. (a) All or a portion of the market value of property
owned by a veteran or by the veteran and the veteran's spouse qualifying for homestead classification
under subdivision 22 or 23 is excluded in determining the property's taxable market value if it serves
as the homestead of a military veteran, as defined in section 197.447, who has a service-connected
disability of 70 percent or more. To qualify for exclusion under this subdivision, the veteran must
have been honorably discharged from the United States armed forces, as indicated by United States
Government Form DD214 or other official military discharge papers, and must be certified by the
United States Veterans Administration as having a service-connected disability.
    (b)(1) For a disability rating of 70 percent or more, $150,000 of market value is excluded, except
as provided in clause (2); and
      (2) for a total (100 percent) and permanent disability, $300,000 of market value is excluded.
    (c) If a disabled veteran qualifying for a valuation exclusion under paragraph (b), clause (2),
predeceases the veteran's spouse, and if upon the death of the veteran the spouse holds the legal or
beneficial title to the homestead and permanently resides there, the exclusion shall carry over to the
benefit of the veteran's spouse for one additional assessment year or until such time as the spouse
sells, transfers, or otherwise disposes of the property, whichever comes first.
   (d) In the case of an agricultural homestead, only the portion of the property consisting of the
house and garage and immediately surrounding one acre of land qualifies for the valuation exclusion
under this subdivision.

   (e) A property qualifying for a valuation exclusion under this subdivision is not eligible for the
credit under section 273.1384, subdivision 1, or classification under subdivision 22, paragraph (b).
    (f) To qualify for a valuation exclusion under this subdivision a property owner must apply to
the assessor by July 1 of each assessment year, except that an annual reapplication is not required
once a property has been accepted for a valuation exclusion under paragraph (b), clause (2), and the
property continues to qualify until there is a change in ownership.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for assessment year 2008 and thereafter, for
taxes payable in 2009 and thereafter, except that the application date in paragraph (f) for the 2008
assessment year is extended to September 1, 2008.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 274.014, subdivision 3, is amended to read:

boards of appeal and equalization meetings must provide proof to the county assessor by December
1, 2006, and each year thereafter, that it is in compliance with the requirements of subdivision 2.
Beginning in 2006, this notice must also verify that there was a quorum of voting members at each
meeting of the board of appeal and equalization in the current year. A city or town that does not
comply with these requirements is deemed to have transferred its board of appeal and equalization
powers to the county beginning with the following year's assessment and continuing unless the
powers are reinstated under paragraph (c).
    (b) The county shall notify the taxpayers when the board of appeal and equalization for a city or
town has been transferred to the county under this subdivision and, prior to the meeting time of the
county board of equalization, the county shall make available to those taxpayers a procedure for a
review of the assessments, including, but not limited to, open book meetings. This alternate review
process shall take place in April and May.
    (c) A local board whose powers are transferred to the county under this subdivision may be
reinstated by resolution of the governing body of the city or town and upon proof of compliance
with the requirements of subdivision 2. The resolution and proofs must be provided to the county
assessor by December 1 in order to be effective for the following year's assessment.
    (d) A local board whose powers are transferred to the county under this subdivision may continue
to employ a local assessor and is not deemed to have transferred its powers to make assessments.

statement is prepared. The dollar amounts attributable to the county, the state tax, the voter approved
school tax, the other local school tax, the township or municipality, and the total of the metropolitan

the appropriate county's levy. If the county levy under this paragraph includes an amount for a lake
improvement district as defined under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for
that purpose must be separately stated from the remaining county levy amount. In the case of Ramsey
County, if the county levy under this paragraph includes an amount for public library service under
section 134.07, the amount attributable for that purpose may be separated from the remaining county

deferred property tax amount. The amount of the tax on contamination value imposed under sections
270.91 to 270.98, if any, must also be separately stated. The dollar amounts, including the dollar
amount of any special assessments, may be rounded to the nearest even whole dollar. For purposes of
this section whole odd-numbered dollars may be adjusted to the next higher even-numbered dollar.
The amount of market value excluded under section 273.11, subdivision 16, if any, must also be

    (d) If the county uses envelopes for mailing property tax statements and if the county agrees, a
taxing district may include a notice with the property tax statement notifying taxpayers when the
taxing district will begin its budget deliberations for the current year, and encouraging taxpayers
to attend the hearings. If the county allows notices to be included in the envelope containing the
property tax statement, and if more than one taxing district relative to a given property decides to
include a notice with the tax statement, the county treasurer or auditor must coordinate the process
and may combine the information on a single announcement.

collection and the uncollectibility of referred debts shall be made by the commissioner who shall
then notify the commissioner of finance and the referring agency. A decision by the commissioner
that a referred debt is uncollectible does not prevent the referring agency from taking additional
collection action.
    (b) Before a debt becomes 121 days past due, a referring agency may refer the debt to the
commissioner for collection at any time after a debt becomes delinquent and uncontested and
the debtor has no further administrative appeal of the amount of the debt. When a debt owed to
a referring agency becomes 121 days past due, the referring agency must refer the debt to the
commissioner for collection. This requirement does not apply if there is a dispute over the amount
or validity of the debt, if the debt is the subject of legal action or administrative proceedings,
or the agency determines that the debtor is adhering to acceptable payment arrangements. The
commissioner may provide that certain types of debt need not be referred to the commissioner
for collection under this paragraph. Methods and procedures for referral must follow internal
guidelines prepared by the commissioner.
    (c) If the referring agency is a court, the court must furnish a debtor's Social Security number to
the commissioner when the court refers the debt.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for debts referred after December 31, 2008.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 270A.08, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Notice to debtor. (a) Not later than five days after the claimant agency has sent
notification to the department pursuant to section 270A.07, subdivision 1, the claimant agency shall
send a written notification to the debtor asserting the right of the claimant agency to the refund or
any part thereof. If the notice is returned to the claimant agency as undeliverable, or the claimant
agency has reason to believe the debtor did not receive the notice, the claimant agency shall obtain
    cu
the ญ ญญrญ

          ญญt last known address of the debtor from the commissioner and resend the corrected notice.
    (b) If a debt has been referred to the commissioner for collection under chapter 16D, and the
referring agency meets the definition of claimant agency under this chapter, the commissioner must
notify the debtor prior to using revenue recapture under this chapter for collection of the debt. The
notice must be sent by United States mail or personal delivery to the last known address of the
debtor.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for debts referred after December 31, 2008.
     Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 270C.33, subdivision 5, is amended to read:

order. The appeal period of an order ends: (1) 60 days after the order has been mailed to the taxpayer
by the commissioner; (2) if an administrative appeal is filed under section 270C.35, 60 days after
determination of the administrative appeal; (3) if an appeal to Tax Court is filed under chapter 271,
when the decision of the Tax Court is made; or (4) if an appeal to Tax Court is filed and the appeal is
based upon a constitutional challenge to the tax, 60 days after final determination of the appeal. This
subdivision does not apply to a jeopardy assessment under section 270C.36, or a jeopardy collection
under section 270C.36.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

period before the establishment of the section 125 plan under this subdivision; and
    (3) certify to the commissioner that the employer has established a section 125 plan and meets
the requirements of 2008 S.F. 3780, article 4, section 10, subdivisions 2 and 3, if enacted.

   (c) The amount of the credit under this subdivision equals the lesser of:
   (1) the employer's actual cost to establish the section 125 plan; or
   (2) $350.
  Subd. 4. Participation credit. (a) The commissioner shall pay a tax credit to eligible small
employers with section 125 plans. The amount of the credit equals the least of the following amounts:
   (1) 50 percent of the amount the employer spends during the calendar year for incentives to
encourage participation by the employer's nonparticipating employees in the employer's section 125
plan;
   (2) $200 for each nonparticipating employee who begins participating in the employer's section
125 plan; or
   (3) the amount of credit certificates the employer received for the calendar year.
   (b) An eligible employer is a small employer that:
   (1) offers a section 125 plan to its employees;
   (2) has five percent or more of its employees not participating in the section 125 plan during the
quarter prior to the application for the tax credit; and
   (3) pays average compensation to its nonparticipating employees of no more than the maximum
annual income of an individual who is eligible to participate in the MinnesotaCare program under
chapter 256L.
    (c) For purposes of this subdivision, "incentives to encourage participation" includes paying
an increased employer share of the premium or other costs of the insurance, contributing to the
employee's health savings account, or taking other measures that the commissioner considers likely
to foster higher rates of participation; and "nonparticipating employee" means an employee who is
not participating in the section 125 plan, and who is not otherwise covered by health insurance other
than MinnesotaCare.
    Subd. 5. Credits and credit certificates. (a) The commissioner may transfer all or part of the
appropriation provided in 2008 S.F. 3780, article 4, section 10, subdivision 4, if enacted, to provide
tax credits under subdivision 3. The commissioner shall allow tax credits under subdivision 3 to
applicants on a first-come-first-served basis and the maximum amount of credits allowed for each
fiscal year is limited to the amount transferred from the appropriation provided in S.F. 3780, article
4, section 10, subdivision 4, if enacted. If applications for credits exceed the allowance for the
fiscal year, the commissioner shall hold the applications and award the credits from the amount
appropriated for that purpose in the next fiscal year. If the commissioner does not transfer any of
the appropriation provided in 2008 S.F. 3780, article 4, section 10, subdivision 4, if enacted, no tax
credits are allowed under subdivision 3.
   (b) Upon application, the commissioner shall award credit certificates to eligible employers
for credits under subdivision 4. The maximum amount of credit certificates is limited to
$730,000 per fiscal year. The commissioner shall award the certificates to eligible employers
on a first-come-first-served basis, and certificates will apply to the calendar year in which the
employer intends to provide incentives for nonparticipating employees to begin participating

certificates. Following the close of the calendar year, employers who have been awarded certificates
must report to the commissioner on the amount spent for incentives to encourage participation
by nonparticipating employees, and the number of nonparticipating employees who became
participating employees, and the commissioner must allow the appropriate credit amount as
provided in subdivision 4, paragraph (a).
    (c) The commissioner may transfer credit authority between the authorizations in paragraphs (a)
and (b) based on the applications for the credits under subdivisions 3 and 4 or on other factors so that
in the commissioner's opinion the allocation between the two credits will provide a more effective
incentive to expand health care coverage.

(b), is appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of commerce in fiscal year 2009.

be made by an appraiser that holds a state appraiser license issued by the Department of Commerce.
The appraisal must be in conformity with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice
of the Appraisal Foundation.
    (c) Before offering surplus state-owned lands for public sale, the lands shall first be offered to
the city, county, town, school district, or other public body corporate or politic in which the lands
are situated for public purposes and the lands may be sold for public purposes for not less than the
appraised value of the lands. To determine whether a public body desires to purchase the surplus
land, the commissioner shall give a written notice to the governing body of each political subdivision
whose jurisdictional boundaries include or are adjacent to the surplus land. If a public body desires
to purchase the surplus land, it shall submit a written offer to the commissioner no later than two
weeks after receipt of notice setting forth in detail its reasons for desiring to acquire and its intended
use of the land. In the event that more than one public body tenders an offer, the commissioner
shall determine which party shall receive the property and shall submit written findings regarding
the decision. If lands are offered for sale for public purposes and if a public body notifies the
commissioner of its desire to acquire the lands, the public body may have up to two years from
the date of the accepted offer to commence payment for the lands in the manner provided by law.

The purchaser must pay at the time of sale ten percent of the total amount bid and the remainder of
the payment is due within 90 days of the sale date. A person who fails to make final payment within
90 days of the sale date is in default. On default, all right, title, and interest of the purchaser or heirs,
representatives, or assigns of the purchaser in the premises shall terminate without the state doing
any act or thing. A record of the default must be made in the state land records of the commissioner.

   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 90.151, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Issuance; expiration. (a) Following receipt of the down payment for state timber
required under section 90.14 or 90.191, the commissioner shall issue a numbered permit to the
purchaser, in a form approved by the attorney general, by the terms of which the purchaser shall be
authorized to enter upon the land, and to cut and remove the timber therein described as designated
for cutting in the report of the state appraiser, according to the provisions of this chapter. The permit
shall be correctly dated and executed by the commissioner and signed by the purchaser. If a permit
is not signed by the purchaser within 60 days from the date of purchase, the permit cancels and the
down payment for timber required under section 90.14 forfeits to the state. The commissioner may
grant an additional period for the purchaser to sign the permit, not to exceed five business days,
provided the purchaser pays a $125 penalty fee.
    (b) The permit shall expire no later than five years after the date of sale as the commissioner shall
specify or as specified under section 90.191, and the timber shall be cut within the time specified
therein. All cut timber, equipment, and buildings not removed from the land within 90 days after
expiration of the permit shall become the property of the state.
    (c) The commissioner may grant an additional period of time not to exceed 120 days for the
removal of cut timber, equipment, and buildings upon receipt of such request by the permit holder
for good and sufficient reasons. The commissioner may grant a second period of time not to exceed
120 days for the removal of cut timber, equipment, and buildings upon receipt of a request by the
permit holder for hardship reasons only.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies
retroactively to permits dated January 1, 2008, and thereafter.
  Sec. 13. [94.3495] EXPEDITED EXCHANGES OF LAND INVOLVING THE STATE
AND GOVERNMENTAL SUBDIVISIONS OF THE STATE.
    Subdivision 1. Purpose and scope. (a) The purpose of this section is to expedite the exchange
of public land ownership. Consolidation of public land reduces management costs and aids in the
reduction of forest fragmentation.
   (b) This section applies to exchanges of land between the state and a governmental subdivision
11104                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [119TH DAY

of the state. For land exchanges under this section, sections 94.342 to 94.347 apply only to the extent
specified in this section.
   Subd. 2. Classes of land; definitions. The classes of public land that may be involved in an
expedited exchange under this section are:
   (1) Class 1 land, which for the purpose of this section is Class A land as defined in section
94.342, subdivision 1, except for:
   (i) school trust land as defined in section 92.025; and
   (ii) university land granted to the state by acts of Congress;
   (2) Class 2 land, which for the purpose of this section is Class B land as defined in section 94.342,
subdivision 2; and
   (3) Class 3 land, which for the purpose of this section is all land owned in fee by a governmental
subdivision of the state.
     Subd. 3. Valuation of land. (a) In an exchange of Class 1 land for Class 2 or 3 land, the value of
all the land shall be determined by the commissioner of natural resources. In an exchange of Class 2
land for Class 3 land, the value of all the land shall be determined by the county board of the county
in which the land lies. To determine the value of the land, the parties to the exchange may cause the
land to be appraised, utilize the valuation process provided under section 84.0272, subdivision 3,
or obtain a market analysis from a qualified real estate broker. Merchantable timber value must be
determined and considered in finalizing valuation of the lands.
     (b) All lands exchanged under this section shall be exchanged only for lands of at least
substantially equal value. For the purposes of this subdivision, "substantially equal value" has the
meaning given under section 94.343, subdivision 3, paragraph (b). No payment is due either party
if the lands are of substantially equal value but are not of the same value.
    Subd. 4. Title. Title to the land must be examined to the extent necessary for the parties to
determine that the title is good, with any encumbrances identified. The parties to the exchange may
utilize title insurance to aid in the determination.
    Subd. 5. Approval by Land Exchange Board. All expedited land exchanges under this
section, and the terms and conditions of the exchanges, require the unanimous approval of the
Land Exchange Board.
    Subd. 6. Conveyance. (a) Conveyance of Class 1 land given in exchange shall be made by deed
executed by the commissioner of natural resources in the name of the state. Conveyance of Class
2 land given in exchange shall be by a deed executed by the commissioner of revenue in the name
of the state. Conveyance of Class 3 land shall be by a deed executed by the governing body in the
name of the governing authority.
   (b) If Class 1 land is given in exchange for Class 2 or 3 land, the deed to the Class 2 or 3 land
shall first be delivered to the commissioner of natural resources. Following the recording of the
deed, the commissioner of natural resources shall deliver the deed conveying the Class 1 land.
    (c) If Class 2 land is given in exchange for Class 3 land, the deed to the Class 3 land shall first be
delivered to the county auditor. Following the recording of the deed, the commissioner of revenue

shall deliver the deed conveying the Class 2 land.
   (d) All deeds shall be recorded or registered in the county in which the lands lie.
    Subd. 7. Reversionary interest; mineral and water power rights and other reservations. (a)
All deeds conveying land given in an expedited land exchange under this section shall include a
reverter that provides that title to the land automatically reverts to the conveying governmental unit
if:
   (1) the receiving governmental unit sells, exchanges, or otherwise transfers title of the land
within 40 years of the date of the deed conveying ownership; and
   (2) there is no prior written approval for the transfer from the conveying governmental unit. The
authority for granting approval is the commissioner of natural resources for former Class 1 land, the
county board for former Class 2 land, and the governing body for former Class 3 land.
    (b) Class 1 land given in exchange is subject to the reservation provisions of section 94.343,
subdivision 4. Class 2 land given in exchange is subject to the reservation provisions of section
94.344, subdivision 4. County fee land given in exchange is subject to the reservation provisions of
section 373.01, subdivision 1, paragraph (g).
    Subd. 8. Land status. Land received in exchange for Class 1 land is subject to the same trust,
if any, and otherwise has the same status as the land given in exchange. Land received in exchange
for Class 2 land is subject to a trust in favor of the governmental subdivision wherein it lies and all
laws relating to tax-forfeited land. Land received in exchange for Class 3 land has the same status
as the land given in exchange.
  Sec. 14. [103G.2251] STATE CONSERVATION EASEMENTS; WETLAND BANK
CREDIT.
    In greater than 80 percent areas, preservation of wetlands owned by the state or a local unit of
government, protected by a permanent conservation easement as defined under section 84C.01 and
held by the board, may be eligible for wetland replacement or mitigation credits, according to rules
adopted by the board. To be eligible for credit under this section, a conservation easement must be
established after enactment of this section and approved by the board.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 282.04, subdivision 4a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4a. Private easements. (a) A county board may convey a road easement across unsold
tax-forfeited land to an individual or a private entity requesting an easement for access to private
property owned by the individual or private entity if:
   (1) there are no reasonable alternatives to obtain access to the individual's or private entity's
property; and
  (2) exercising the easement will not cause significant adverse environmental or natural resource
management impacts.
    (b) The county auditor shall require an individual or a private entity applying for an easement
under paragraph (a) to pay the appraised value of the easement. The conveyance must provide that
the easement reverts to the state in trust for the taxing district in the event of nonuse.

of labor, electrical, agricultural, or horticultural organizations, including organizations that operate
aquatic farms, as defined in section 17.47, subdivision 3, that are instituted for the purpose of mutual

   17.4981 GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR REGULATION OF AQUATIC FARMS.
    (a) Aquatic farms are licensed to culture private aquatic life. Cultured aquatic life is not wildlife.
Aquatic farms must be licensed and given classifications to prevent or minimize impacts on natural
resources. The purpose of sections 17.4981 to 17.4997 is to:
   (1) prevent public aquatic life from entering an aquatic farm;
11138                                        JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                 [119TH DAY

the commissioner;
     (3) protect against release of disease pathogens to public waters;
     (4) protect existing natural aquatic habitats and the wildlife dependent on them; and
     (5) protect private aquatic life from unauthorized taking or harvest.
   (b) Private aquatic life that is legally acquired and possessed is an article of interstate commerce
and may be restricted only as necessary to protect state fish and water resources.
    (c) The commissioner of natural resources shall establish license and other fees as provided
in section 16A.1285, subdivision 2, that would make aquaculture licensing and enforcement
self-sustaining. The commissioner shall develop best management practices for aquaculture to
ensure the long-term sustainability of aquaculture and wetlands used for aquaculture, including,
but not limited to, fish farming in man-made ponds.
     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 17.4984, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

commissioner.
     (c) Licenses are valid for five years and are transferable upon notification to the commissioner.
   (d) The commissioner shall issue an aquatic farm license on payment of the required license fee
under section 17.4988.
    (e) A license issued by the commissioner is not a determination of private property rights, but
is only based on a determination that the licensee does not have a significant detrimental impact on
the public resource.

to conflicts of interest developed by the Office of Grants Management under section 16B.98.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, a "conflict of interest" exists when a person has an
organizational conflict of interest or direct financial interests and those interests present the

    (a) The commissioner may limit the number of persons that may hunt bear in an area, if it
is necessary to prevent an overharvest or improve the distribution of hunters. The commissioner
may establish, by rule, a method, including a drawing, to impartially select the hunters for an area.
The commissioner shall give preference to hunters that have previously applied and have not been
selected.
   (b) In the case of a drawing, the commissioner shall allow a person to apply for a permit in more

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 2597 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
    That the House recede from its amendments and that S.F. No. 2597 be further amended as
follows:

   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 123B.03, subdivision 1, as amended by Laws 2008,
chapter 275, section 1, is amended to read:
11194                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [119TH DAY

    Subdivision 1. Background check required. (a) A school hiring authority shall request a
criminal history background check from the superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension
on all individuals who are offered employment in a school and on all individuals, except enrolled
student volunteers, who are offered the opportunity to provide athletic coaching services or other
extracurricular academic coaching services to a school, regardless of whether any compensation
is paid. In order for an individual to be eligible for employment or to provide the services, the
individual must provide an executed criminal history consent form and a money order or check
payable to either the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension or the school hiring authority, at the
discretion of the school hiring authority, in an amount equal to the actual cost to the Bureau of
Criminal Apprehension and the school district of conducting the criminal history background
check. A school hiring authority deciding to receive payment may, at its discretion, accept payment
in the form of a negotiable instrument other than a money order or check and shall pay the
superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension directly to conduct the background check.
The superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension shall conduct the background check by
retrieving criminal history data maintained in the criminal justice information system computers.
A school hiring authority, at its discretion, may decide not to request a criminal history background
check on an individual who holds an initial entrance license issued by the State Board of Teaching
or the commissioner of education within the 12 months preceding an offer of employment.
    (b) A school hiring authority may use the results of a criminal background check conducted at
the request of another school hiring authority if:
    (1) the results of the criminal background check are on file with the other school hiring authority
or otherwise accessible;
   (2) the other school hiring authority conducted a criminal background check within the previous
12 months;
   (3) the individual who is the subject of the criminal background check executes a written consent
form giving a school hiring authority access to the results of the check; and
    (4) there is no reason to believe that the individual has committed an act subsequent to the check
that would disqualify the individual for employment.
    (c) A school hiring authority may, at its discretion, request a criminal history background check
from the superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension on any individual who seeks
to enter a school or its grounds for the purpose of serving as a school volunteer or working as
an independent contractor or student employee. In order for an individual to enter a school or its
grounds under this paragraph when the school hiring authority decides to request a criminal history
background check on the individual, the individual first must provide an executed criminal history
consent form and a money order, check, or other negotiable instrument payable to the school district
in an amount equal to the actual cost to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the school district
of conducting the criminal history background check. Notwithstanding section 299C.62, subdivision
1, the cost of the criminal history background check under this paragraph is the responsibility of the
individual.
    (d) For all nonstate residents who are offered employment in a school, a school hiring authority
shall request a criminal history background check on such individuals from the superintendent of the
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and from the government agency performing the same function in
the resident state or, if no government entity performs the same function in the resident state, from
119TH DAY]                            SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                         11195

the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Such individuals must provide an executed criminal history
consent form and a money order, check, or other negotiable instrument payable to the school hiring
authority in an amount equal to the actual cost to the government agencies and the school district of
conducting the criminal history background check. Notwithstanding section 299C.62, subdivision
1, the cost of the criminal history background check under this paragraph is the responsibility of the
individual.
    (e) At the beginning of each school year or when a student enrolls, a school hiring authority
must notify parents and guardians about the school hiring authority's policy requiring a criminal
history background check on employees and other individuals who provide services to the school,
and identify those positions subject to a background check and the extent of the hiring authority's
discretion in requiring a background check. The school hiring authority may include the notice
in the student handbook, a school policy guide, or other similar communication. Nothing in this
paragraph affects a school hiring authority's ability to request a criminal history background check
on an individual under paragraph (c).

action under subdivision 1a but shall notify the individual that the individual's employment or
other service may be terminated based on the result of the background check or Board of Teaching
action. A school hiring authority is not liable for failing to hire or for terminating an individual's
employment or other service based on the result of a background check or Board of Teaching
action under this section.
