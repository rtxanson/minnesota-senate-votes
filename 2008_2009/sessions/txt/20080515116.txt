116TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MAY 15, 2008                                      10245

Dear President Metzen:
This letter is to clarify a portion of my veto message of May 12, 2008, regarding Chapter 301,
Senate File 651, a bill banning flame retardants and certain other chemicals from products sold in
Minnesota.
The veto message incorrectly stated that decabromodiphenyl ether (DECA) is used as a flame
retardant in children's clothing. While DECA is used as a flame retardant in products such as
furniture, consumer electronics, and commercial drapes, it is our understanding it is not used in
children's clothing. We apologize for the error.
That misstatement does not alter the reasons for the veto. I vetoed the bill for two primary reasons:
1) Many studies regarding the impact of DECA do not support a ban; and 2) I believe our state
agencies should review all available research and make a recommendation before moving forward
with an outright ban.
My Administration is willing to work with the Legislature to craft legislation that will require the
careful study of the science in this area and impose limitations on these compounds as appropriate.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Tim Pawlenty, Governor

information:
    (1) the blood sample will be used to test for heritable and congenital disorders, the blood sample
will be retained by the Department of Health for a period of at least two years and that the blood
sample may be used for public health studies and research;
   (2) the data that will be collected as a result of the testing;
    (3) the alternatives available to the parents set forth in paragraph (c) and that a form to exercise
the alternatives is available from the person with a duty to perform testing under subdivision 1;
   (4) the benefits of testing and the consequences of a decision to permit or refuse to supply a
sample;
    (5) the benefits of retaining the blood sample and the consequences of a decision to destroy the
blood sample after two years or to permit or decline to have the blood sample used for public health
studies and research;
   (6) the ways in which the samples and data collected will be stored and used at the Department
of Health and elsewhere; and
  (7) the Department of Health's Web site address where the forms referenced in paragraph (c)
may be obtained.
This document satisfies the requirements of section 13.04, subdivision 2.
    (b) The person with a duty to perform testing must record that parents or legal guardians of
infants have received the information provided under this subdivision and have had an opportunity
to ask questions.
   (c) The parent or legal guardian of an infant otherwise subject to testing under this section may
object to any of the following:
   (1) the testing itself;
   (2) the maintenance of the infant's blood samples and test result records for a period longer than
24 months; and
    (3) the use of the infant's blood samples and test result records for public health studies and
research.
If a parent or legal guardian elects to object to one or more of the alternatives in this paragraph,
the election shall be recorded on a form that is signed by the parent or legal guardian. The signed
form shall be made part of the infant's medical record and shall be provided to the Department of
Health. The signature of the parent or legal guardian is sufficient and no witness to the signature,
photo identification, or notarization shall be required. When a parent or legal guardian elects an
alternative under this subdivision, the Department of Health must follow the election and section
144.128. A written election exempts an infant from the requirements of this section and section
144.128.
   (d) For purposes of this subdivision, "public health studies and research" includes calibrating
newborn screening equipment, evaluating existing newborn screening tests to reduce the number of

for heritable and congenital disorders, and other population-based health studies.
   Sec. 3. NEWBORN SCREENING REPORT.
    By January 15, 2009, the Department of Health shall report and make recommendations to the
legislature on its current efforts for ensuring and enhancing how parents of newborns are fully
informed about the newborn screening program and of their rights and options regarding: (1)
testing; (2) storage; (3) public health practices, studies, and research; (4) the ability to opt out of the
collection of data and specimens related to the testing; and (5) the ability to seek private testing."

    We, the undersigned conferees for H. F. No. 3195 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
    That the Senate recede from its amendment and that H. F. No. 3195 be further amended as
follows:
      Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
      "Section 1. TITLE.
      This act may be cited as the Green Solutions Act of 2008.
      Sec. 2. MIDWESTERN GREENHOUSE GAS ACCORD.
   (a) By January 15, 2009, the commissioner of commerce and the commissioner of the Pollution
Control Agency shall submit a report to the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate
and house of representatives committees with primary jurisdiction over energy policy, business
and economic development policy, environmental policy and finance, and transportation policy
regarding:
   (1) the status of the development of a model rule establishing a regional cap and trade program
under the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Accord;
      (2) implementation mechanisms in the model rule, including required legislation;
   (3) whether the regional cap and trade program will operate in a time frame that will allow
Minnesota to meet the greenhouse gas reductions goals under Minnesota Statutes, section 216H.02,
subdivision 1;
   (4) an evaluation of legislation enacted or pending in Congress to implement a federal cap
and trade program and whether implementation of a regional program is consistent with a federal
program;
      (5) the economic, environmental, and public health impact study under section 3, subdivision 2;
and
      (6) a potential cap and trade revenue study under section 3, subdivision 3.
If a model rule in accord with the state's emissions reduction goals is not yet ready for adoption
under the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Accord, or is unlikely to be adopted, the report must identify
options for Minnesota to supplement the regional agreement with state policies, to join another
regional cap and trade program, or to implement a cap and trade program in Minnesota alone.
    (b) The Legislative Greenhouse Gas Accord Advisory Group is composed of six members of
the legislature, appointed as follows:
  (1) three members of the senate appointed by the Subcommittee on Committees of the
Committee on Rules and Administration, including one member of the minority; and
    (2) three members of the house of representatives appointed by the speaker of the house of
representatives, including one member of the minority party.
The legislative advisory group serves in an advisory capacity to the governor's Midwestern
10258                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                               [116TH DAY

Greenhouse Gas Accord stakeholder group, and must receive regular briefings from that group, in
addition to participating and offering advice in meetings where regional negotiations take place
with respect to the accord or to any other energy issue being analyzed by an entity created by
the Midwestern Governors Association at its November 2007 Energy Summit. The appointing
authorities under this paragraph must complete their appointments by June 1, 2008. The advisory
group expires when the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Accord stakeholder group is dissolved.
    (c) Any cap and trade agreements entered into under the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Accord
are not effective in Minnesota until approved by a law enacted by the legislature.
  Sec. 3. ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT AND
POTENTIAL REVENUES STUDIES.
    Subdivision 1. Submission of studies. By January 15, 2009, the commissioner of commerce
and the commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency shall submit to the chairs and ranking
minority members of the senate and house of representatives committees with primary jurisdiction
over business and economic development, energy, and environmental policy and finance the two
studies, prepared by expert consultants, described in this section.
    Subd. 2. Economic, environmental, and public health impact study. The commissioner of
commerce shall arrange with the Midwestern Governors Association for a study to be conducted
by expert consultants that analyzes the economic, environmental, and public health costs and
benefits to Minnesota of a cap and trade program. The study must consider the impact of a cap and
trade program on individual industrial sectors subject to the program and on the state economy
and consumers, and how expenditures of any auction revenues on the measures identified in
subdivision 4 can reduce the economic costs and increase the economic, environmental, and public
health benefits. The study must also include:
   (1) an estimate of allowance prices and rates of investment by entities subject to a cap and trade
program in infrastructure and equipment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases over time;
   (2) estimates of the impact of the program on energy costs, the impact of energy cost changes
on businesses and households, and recommendations on how to avoid regressive impacts;
   (3) an analysis of options to mitigate adverse competitive impacts on state businesses and
methods to reduce disruptive impacts on workers, businesses, and consumers;
    (4) an analysis of various mechanisms for protecting jobs in energy intensive industries subject
to competition from outside the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Accord region, including mining,
pulp and paper, petroleum refining, steel, and chemicals, and an analysis of possible mechanisms
to account for the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production and transportation of
imported goods;
   (5) an analysis of the energy cost impacts on homes and businesses, job growth, new business
development, energy balance of trade, and environmental and public health co-benefits;
    (6) an analysis of various mechanisms to provide for equity to communities at risk of
disproportionate economic or environmental impacts; and
   (7) an analysis of the effect of adopting a cap and trade program on the level of foreign and
domestic investment in Minnesota.
116TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MAY 15, 2008                                       10259

The study must consider the data and policy recommendations developed through the Minnesota
Climate Change Advisory Group as well as the growing literature related to reducing greenhouse
gas emissions.
   Subd. 3. Potential cap and trade revenue study. The commissioner of commerce shall arrange
with the Midwestern Governors Association for a study to be conducted by expert consultants on
potential revenues to the state from a cap and trade program and how revenues could be spent to
mitigate economic disparities resulting from implementation of a cap and trade program. The study
must include:
   (1) projections of likely revenues if greenhouse gas emission allowances are auctioned;
    (2) a detailed estimate of the degree to which different levels of expenditures of auction proceeds
on the options listed under subdivision 4, clauses (1) through (7), would:
   (i) reduce greenhouse gas emissions;
   (ii) reduce economic costs to industry and households;
    (iii) yield jobs and other economic benefits by stimulating economic activity, promoting the
growth of new businesses, reducing the amount of money exported from the state to purchase fossil
fuels, and other means;
   (iv) result in environmental and public health co-benefits by reducing pollutants other than
greenhouse gases, improving habitat, or other means; and
   (v) otherwise meet the goals identified in subdivision 5;
   (3) a discussion of the potential for allowances allocated by a cap and trade program to lead to
unfair economic advantage or windfall profits rather than be used to reduce consumer prices; and
   (4) options for criteria that decision makers can use to determine how to allocate expenditures
among the spending options listed under subdivision 4, balancing the goals set forth in subdivision
5.
   Subd. 4. Expenditures to be studied. The studies required under subdivisions 2 and 3 must
consider the impacts of the following types of expenditures:
   (1) direct per capita rebates to Minnesotans;
   (2) grants and incentives to consumers to invest in energy efficiency and utilize renewable energy
sources or in other technologies, products, or practices that help Minnesotans reduce energy costs,
energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions, including incentives for telecommuting;
   (3) financial assistance to businesses that install technologies that reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, targeting energy-intensive industries facing competitors not subject to comparable
regulation, including, but not limited to, mining, pulp and paper, refining, chemicals, and steel;
   (4) investments in public infrastructure that reduce greenhouse gas emissions;
   (5) investments in worker training and retraining programs;
   (6) incentives for terrestrial and geologic carbon sequestration; and
10260                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [116TH DAY

   (7) at least one scenario in which a majority of expenditures is directed to uses under clauses (1)
and (2).
    Subd. 5. Study criteria. The study required under subdivision 2 must determine the extent to
which expenditures on the measures identified in subdivision 4 assist Minnesota in its transition to a
low greenhouse gas-emitting economy and increase the economic gains and reduce the dislocating
impacts of the transition. Specifically, the study must assess the extent to which expenditures meet
the following goals:
   (1) produce cost-effective emission reductions;
   (2) increase sustainable economic development, job creation, and job growth;
   (3) reduce greenhouse gas emissions in sectors that do not participate in a cap and trade program;
   (4) reduce disruptive economic impacts of the transition on workers, businesses, and consumers;
    (5) equitably distribute the costs and benefits among state residents, communities, and economic
sectors;
   (6) assist low-income and other consumers to reduce the costs associated with greenhouse gas
emissions; and
   (7) protect and enhance public health, environmental quality, wildlife habitat, and the state's
natural resources.
   Sec. 4. GOVERNANCE STUDY.
   The commissioner of commerce shall request the Board of Regents of the University of
Minnesota to prepare a study to be submitted by January 15, 2009, to the chairs and ranking
minority members of the senate and house of representatives committees with primary jurisdiction
over business and economic development, energy, and environmental policy and finance on
governance options for determining expenditures of potential revenue to the state resulting from a
cap and trade program. The study must examine:
    (1) the role of the legislature, citizens, technical experts, and state agencies in decisions on
allocating funds; and
   (2) innovative decision-making structures and processes, including the Legislative-Citizen
Commission on Minnesota Resources, and other examples in Minnesota and other states and
countries that may offer useful models.
   Sec. 5. APPROPRIATION.
    Of the amounts appropriated from the special revenue fund in the second year to the
commissioner of commerce under Laws 2007, chapter 57, article 2, section 3, subdivision 6,
clause (7), up to $500,000 is for the economic impact and potential revenue studies under section
3, and the governance study under section 4. The commissioner shall provide funding from this
appropriation through a contract with the Midwestern Governors Association for grants to technical
experts to complete the studies required under section 3. The commissioner shall transfer up to
$75,000 to the University of Minnesota for the study required under section 4."

declaration creating a new common interest community, unless the county treasurer has certified
that the property taxes payable in the current year for the real estate included in the proposed
common interest community have been paid. This certification is in addition to the certification
for delinquent taxes required by section 272.12. In the case of preexisting common interest
communities, the recording officer shall accept, file, and record the following instruments, without
requiring a certification as to the current or delinquent taxes on any of the units in the common
interest community: (i) a declaration subjecting the common interest community to this chapter; (ii)
a declaration changing the form of a common interest community pursuant to section 515B.2-123;
or (iii) an amendment to or restatement of the declaration, bylaws, or CIC plat. In order for an
instrument to be accepted and recorded under the preceding sentence, the instrument must not
create or change unit or common area boundaries.

     Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.15, subdivision 1h, is amended to read:
     Subd. 1h. Estates of specific persons receiving medical assistance. (a) For purposes of this
section, paragraphs (b) to (k) apply if a person received medical assistance for which a claim may
be filed under this section and died single, or the surviving spouse of the couple and was not survived
by any of the persons described in subdivisions 3 and 4.
    (b) For purposes of this section, the person's estate consists of: (1) ­h    t­­

estate; (2) all of the person's interests or proceeds of those interests in real property the person owned
as a life tenant or as a joint tenant with a right of survivorship at the time of the person's death; (3) all
of the person's interests or proceeds of those interests in securities the person owned in beneficiary
form as provided under sections 524.6-301 to 524.6-311 at the time of the person's death, to the
extent they become part of the probate estate under section 524.6-307; ­         an
                                                                                  ­d­ (4) all of the person's
interests in joint accounts, multiple party accounts, and pay on death accounts, or the proceeds of
those accounts, as provided under sections 524.6-201 to 524.6-214 at the time of the person's death
to the extent they become part of the probate estate under section 524.6-207; and (5) the person's
legal title or interest at the time of the person's death in real property transferred under a transfer
on death deed under section 507.071, or in the proceeds from the subsequent sale of the person's
interest in the real property. Notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, a state or county agency
with a claim under this section shall be a creditor under section 524.6-307.
    (c) Notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, the person's life estate or joint tenancy
interest in real property not subject to a medical assistance lien under sections 514.980 to 514.985
on the date of the person's death shall not end upon the person's death and shall continue as provided
in this subdivision. The life estate in the person's estate shall be that portion of the interest in the real
property subject to the life estate that is equal to the life estate percentage factor for the life estate
as listed in the Life Estate Mortality Table of the health care program's manual for a person who
was the age of the medical assistance recipient on the date of the person's death. The joint tenancy

interest in real property in the estate shall be equal to the fractional interest the person would have
owned in the jointly held interest in the property had they and the other owners held title to the
property as tenants in common on the date the person died.
    (d) The court upon its own motion, or upon motion by the personal representative or any
interested party, may enter an order directing the remaindermen or surviving joint tenants and their
spouses, if any, to sign all documents, take all actions, and otherwise fully cooperate with the
personal representative and the court to liquidate the decedent's life estate or joint tenancy interests
in the estate and deliver the cash or the proceeds of those interests to the personal representative
and provide for any legal and equitable sanctions as the court deems appropriate to enforce and
carry out the order, including an award of reasonable attorney fees.
    (e) The personal representative may make, execute, and deliver any conveyances or other
documents necessary to convey the decedent's life estate or joint tenancy interest in the estate that
are necessary to liquidate and reduce to cash the decedent's interest or for any other purposes.
    (f) Subject to administration, all costs, including reasonable attorney fees, directly and
immediately related to liquidating the decedent's life estate or joint tenancy interest in the decedent's
estate, shall be paid from the gross proceeds of the liquidation allocable to the decedent's interest
and the net proceeds shall be turned over to the personal representative and applied to payment of
the claim presented under this section.
    (g) The personal representative shall bring a motion in the district court in which the estate is
being probated to compel the remaindermen or surviving joint tenants to account for and deliver
to the personal representative all or any part of the proceeds of any sale, mortgage, transfer,
conveyance, or any disposition of real property allocable to the decedent's life estate or joint
tenancy interest in the decedent's estate, and do everything necessary to liquidate and reduce to cash
the decedent's interest and turn the proceeds of the sale or other disposition over to the personal
representative. The court may grant any legal or equitable relief including, but not limited to,
ordering a partition of real estate under chapter 558 necessary to make the value of the decedent's
life estate or joint tenancy interest available to the estate for payment of a claim under this section.
    (h) Subject to administration, the personal representative shall use all of the cash or proceeds of
interests to pay an allowable claim under this section. The remaindermen or surviving joint tenants
and their spouses, if any, may enter into a written agreement with the personal representative or the
claimant to settle and satisfy obligations imposed at any time before or after a claim is filed.
    (i) The personal representative may, at their discretion, provide any or all of the other owners,
remaindermen, or surviving joint tenants with an affidavit terminating the decedent's estate's
interest in real property the decedent owned as a life tenant or as a joint tenant with others, if the
personal representative determines in good faith that neither the decedent nor any of the decedent's
predeceased spouses received any medical assistance for which a claim could be filed under this
section, or if the personal representative has filed an affidavit with the court that the estate has other
assets sufficient to pay a claim, as presented, or if there is a written agreement under paragraph (h),
or if the claim, as allowed, has been paid in full or to the full extent of the assets the estate has
available to pay it. The affidavit may be recorded in the office of the county recorder or filed in
the Office of the Registrar of Titles for the county in which the real property is located. Except as
provided in section 514.981, subdivision 6, when recorded or filed, the affidavit shall terminate the
decedent's interest in real estate the decedent owned as a life tenant or a joint tenant with others.

The affidavit shall: (1) be signed by the personal representative; (2) identify the decedent and the
interest being terminated; (3) give recording information sufficient to identify the instrument that
created the interest in real property being terminated; (4) legally describe the affected real property;
(5) state that the personal representative has determined that neither the decedent nor any of the
decedent's predeceased spouses received any medical assistance for which a claim could be filed
under this section; (6) state that the decedent's estate has other assets sufficient to pay the claim, as
presented, or that there is a written agreement between the personal representative and the claimant
and the other owners or remaindermen or other joint tenants to satisfy the obligations imposed
under this subdivision; and (7) state that the affidavit is being given to terminate the estate's interest
under this subdivision, and any other contents as may be appropriate.
The recorder or registrar of titles shall accept the affidavit for recording or filing. The affidavit shall
be effective as provided in this section and shall constitute notice even if it does not include recording
information sufficient to identify the instrument creating the interest it terminates. The affidavit shall
be conclusive evidence of the stated facts.
   (j) The holder of a lien arising under subdivision 1c shall release the lien at the holder's expense
against an interest terminated under paragraph (h) to the extent of the termination.
    (k) If a lien arising under subdivision 1c is not released under paragraph (j), prior to closing the
estate, the personal representative shall deed the interest subject to the lien to the remaindermen or
surviving joint tenants as their interests may appear. Upon recording or filing, the deed shall work
a merger of the recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interest, subject to the lien, into the remainder
interest or interest the decedent and others owned jointly. The lien shall attach to and run with the
property to the extent of the decedent's interest at the time of the decedent's death.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.15, subdivision 1i, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1i. Estates of persons receiving medical assistance and survived by others. (a) For
purposes of this subdivision, the person's estate consists of the person's probate estate and all of the
person's interests in real property the person owned as a life tenant or a joint tenant at the time of the
person's death and the person's legal title or interest at the time of the person's death in real property
transferred to a beneficiary under a transfer on death deed under section 507.071, or in the proceeds
from the subsequent sale of the person's interest in the transferred real property.
    (b) Notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, this subdivision applies if a person received
medical assistance for which a claim could be filed under this section but for the fact the person was
survived by a spouse or by a person listed in subdivision 3, or if subdivision 4 applies to a claim
arising under this section.
    (c) The person's life estate or joint tenancy interests in real property not subject to a medical
assistance lien under sections 514.980 to 514.985 on the date of the person's death shall not end
upon death and shall continue as provided in this subdivision. The life estate in the estate shall be
the portion of the interest in the property subject to the life estate that is equal to the life estate
percentage factor for the life estate as listed in the Life Estate Mortality Table of the health care
program's manual for a person who was the age of the medical assistance recipient on the date of
the person's death. The joint tenancy interest in the estate shall be equal to the fractional interest
the medical assistance recipient would have owned in the jointly held interest in the property had
they and the other owners held title to the property as tenants in common on the date the medical
assistance recipient died.

    (d) The county agency shall file a claim in the estate under this section on behalf of the claimant
who shall be the commissioner of human services, notwithstanding that the decedent is survived by
a spouse or a person listed in subdivision 3. The claim, as allowed, shall not be paid by the estate
and shall be disposed of as provided in this paragraph. The personal representative or the court shall
make, execute, and deliver a lien in favor of the claimant on the decedent's interest in real property in
the estate in the amount of the allowed claim on forms provided by the commissioner to the county
agency filing the lien. The lien shall bear interest as provided under section 524.3-806, shall attach
to the property it describes upon filing or recording, and shall remain a lien on the real property it
describes for a period of 20 years from the date it is filed or recorded. The lien shall be a disposition
of the claim sufficient to permit the estate to close.
    (e) The state or county agency shall file or record the lien in the office of the county recorder
or registrar of titles for each county in which any of the real property is located. The recorder or
registrar of titles shall accept the lien for filing or recording. All recording or filing fees shall be paid
by the Department of Human Services. The recorder or registrar of titles shall mail the recorded lien
to the Department of Human Services. The lien need not be attested, certified, or acknowledged as
a condition of recording or filing. Upon recording or filing of a lien against a life estate or a joint
tenancy interest, the interest subject to the lien shall merge into the remainder interest or the interest
the recipient and others owned jointly. The lien shall attach to and run with the property to the extent
of the decedent's interest in the property at the time of the decedent's death as determined under this
section.
    (f) The department shall make no adjustment or recovery under the lien until after the decedent's
spouse, if any, has died, and only at a time when the decedent has no surviving child described in
subdivision 3. The estate, any owner of an interest in the property which is or may be subject to
the lien, or any other interested party, may voluntarily pay off, settle, or otherwise satisfy the claim
secured or to be secured by the lien at any time before or after the lien is filed or recorded. Such
payoffs, settlements, and satisfactions shall be deemed to be voluntary repayments of past medical
assistance payments for the benefit of the deceased recipient, and neither the process of settling the
claim, the payment of the claim, or the acceptance of a payment shall constitute an adjustment or
recovery that is prohibited under this subdivision.
    (g) The lien under this subdivision may be enforced or foreclosed in the manner provided by
law for the enforcement of judgment liens against real estate or by a foreclosure by action under
chapter 581. When the lien is paid, satisfied, or otherwise discharged, the state or county agency
shall prepare and file a release of lien at its own expense. No action to foreclose the lien shall be
commenced unless the lien holder has first given 30 days' prior written notice to pay the lien to the
owners and parties in possession of the property subject to the lien. The notice shall: (1) include the
name, address, and telephone number of the lien holder; (2) describe the lien; (3) give the amount
of the lien; (4) inform the owner or party in possession that payment of the lien in full must be made
to the lien holder within 30 days after service of the notice or the lien holder may begin proceedings
to foreclose the lien; and (5) be served by personal service, certified mail, return receipt requested,
ordinary first class mail, or by publishing it once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county
in which any part of the property is located. Service of the notice shall be complete upon mailing or
publication.

     When:
     (a) a deed or other instrument conveying land,
     (b) a plat of any town site or addition thereto,

   (e) a common interest community plat subject to chapter 515B or a declaration that contains
such a plat,
is presented to the county auditor for transfer, the auditor shall ascertain from the records if there
be taxes delinquent upon the land described therein, or if it has been sold for taxes. An assignment
of a sheriff's or referee's certificate of sale, when the certificate of sale describes real estate,
and certificates of redemption from mortgage or lien foreclosure sales, when the certificate of
redemption encompasses real estate and is issued to a junior creditor, are considered instruments
conveying land for the purposes of this section and section 272.121. If there are taxes delinquent,
the auditor shall certify to the same; and upon payment of such taxes, or in case no taxes are
delinquent, shall transfer the land upon the books of the auditor's office, and note upon the
instrument, over official signature, the words, "no delinquent taxes and transfer entered," or, if the
land described has been sold or assigned to an actual purchaser for taxes, the words "paid by sale
of land described within;" and, unless such statement is made upon such instrument, the county
recorder or the registrar of titles shall refuse to receive or record the same; provided, that sheriff's
or referees' certificates of sale on execution or foreclosure of a lien or mortgage, certificates of
redemption from mortgage or lien foreclosure sales issued to the redeeming mortgagor or lienee,
deeds of distribution made by a personal representative in probate proceedings, transfer on death
deeds under section 507.071, decrees and judgments, receivers receipts, patents, and copies of
town or statutory city plats, in case the original plat filed in the office of the county recorder has
been lost or destroyed, and the instruments releasing, removing and discharging reversionary and
forfeiture provisions affecting title to land and instruments releasing, removing or discharging
easement rights in land or building or other restrictions, may be recorded without such certificate;
and, provided that instruments conveying land and, as appurtenant thereto an easement over
adjacent tract or tracts of land, may be recorded without such certificate as to the land covered by
such easement; and provided further, that any instrument granting an easement made in favor of
any public utility or pipe line for conveying gas, liquids or solids in suspension, in the nature of a
right-of-way over, along, across or under a tract of land may be recorded without such certificate
as to the land covered by such easement. Documents governing homeowners associations of
condominiums, townhouses, common interest ownership communities, and other planned unit
developments may be recorded without the auditor's certificate to the extent provided in section
515B.1-116(f).
    A deed of distribution made by a personal representative in a probate proceeding, a decree, or a
judgment that conveys land shall be presented to the county auditor, who shall transfer the land upon
the books of the auditor's office and note upon the instrument, over official signature, the words,
"transfer entered", and the instrument may then be recorded. A decree or judgment that affects title
to land but does not convey land may be recorded without presentation to the auditor.

    A violation of this section by the county recorder or the registrar of titles shall be a gross
misdemeanor, and, in addition to the punishment therefor, the recorder or registrar shall be liable
to the grantee of any instrument so recorded for the amount of any damages sustained.
    When, as a condition to permitting the recording of deed or other instrument affecting the title to
real estate previously forfeited to the state under the provisions of sections 281.16 to 281.25, county
officials, after such real estate has been purchased or repurchased, have required the payment of
taxes erroneously assumed to have accrued against such real estate after forfeiture and before the
date of purchase or repurchase, the sum required to be so paid shall be refunded to the persons
entitled thereto out of moneys in the funds in which the sum so paid was placed. Delinquent taxes
are those taxes deemed delinquent under section 279.02.

   (15) A transfer on death deed under section 507.071.
   Sec. 5. [507.071] TRANSFER ON DEATH DEEDS.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. For the purposes of this section the following terms have the
meanings given:
   (a) "Beneficiary" or "grantee beneficiary" means a person or entity named as a grantee
beneficiary in a transfer on death deed, including a successor grantee beneficiary.
    (b) "County agency" means the county department or office designated to recover medical
assistance benefits from the estates of decedents.
    (c) "Grantor owner" means an owner named as a grantor in a transfer on death deed upon whose
death the conveyance or transfer of the described real property is conditioned. Grantor owner does
not include a spouse who joins in a transfer on death deed solely for the purpose of conveying or
releasing statutory or other marital interests in the real property to be conveyed or transferred by the
transfer on death deed.
   (d) "Owner" means a person having an ownership or other interest in all or part of the real
property to be conveyed or transferred by a transfer on death deed. Owner does not include a spouse
who joins in a transfer on death deed solely for the purpose of conveying or releasing statutory or
other marital interests in the real property to be conveyed or transferred by the transfer on death
deed.
   (e) "Recorded" means recorded in the office of the county recorder or registrar of titles, as
appropriate for the real property described in the instrument to be recorded.
   (f) "State agency" means the Department of Human Services or any successor agency.
   (g) "Transfer on death deed" means a deed authorized under this section.
   Subd. 2. Effect of transfer on death deed. A deed that conveys or assigns an interest in real
property, including a mortgage, judgment, or any other lien on real property, to a grantee beneficiary
and that expressly states that the deed is only effective on the death of one or more of the grantor
owners, transfers the interest to the grantee beneficiary upon the death of the grantor owner upon
whose death the conveyance or transfer is stated to be effective, but subject to the survivorship
provisions and requirements of section 524.2-702. A transfer on death deed must comply with all
provisions of Minnesota law applicable to deeds of real property including, but not limited to, the
provisions of sections 507.02, 507.24, 507.34, 508.48, and 508A.48.
    Subd. 3. Rights of creditors and rights of the state and county under sections 246.53,
256B.15, 256D.16, 261.04, and 514.981. The interest transferred to a beneficiary under a transfer
on death deed after the death of a grantor owner is transferred subject to all effective conveyances,
assignments, contracts, mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, security pledges, judgments, tax liens, and
other encumbrances made by the grantor owner or to which the property was subject during the
grantor owner's lifetime, including but not limited to, any claim by a surviving spouse or any claim
or lien by the state or county agency authorized by section 246.53, 256B.15, 256D.16, 261.04, or
514.981, if other assets of the deceased owner's estate are insufficient to pay the amount of any
such claim. A beneficiary to whom the interest is transferred after the death of a grantor owner
shall be liable to account to the state or county agency with a claim or lien authorized by section
116TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MAY 15, 2008                                         10273

246.53, 256B.15, 256D.16, 261.04, or 514.981, to the extent necessary to discharge any such
claim remaining unpaid after application of the assets of the deceased grantor owner's estate, but
such liability shall be limited to the value of the interest transferred to the beneficiary. To establish
compliance with this subdivision and subdivision 23, the beneficiary must record a clearance
certificate issued in accordance with subdivision 23 in each county in which the real property
described in the transfer on death deed is located.
   Subd. 4. Multiple grantee beneficiaries. A transfer on death deed may designate multiple
grantee beneficiaries to take title as joint tenants, as tenants in common or in any other form of
ownership or tenancy that is valid under the laws of this state.
    Subd. 5. Successor grantee beneficiaries. A transfer on death deed may designate one or more
successor grantee beneficiaries or a class of successor grantee beneficiaries, or both. If the transfer on
death deed designates successor grantee beneficiaries or a class of successor grantee beneficiaries,
the deed shall state the condition under which the interest of the successor grantee beneficiaries
would vest.
    Subd. 6. Multiple joint tenant grantors. If an interest in real property is owned as joint tenants,
a transfer on death deed executed by all of the owners that conveys an interest in real property to
one or more grantee beneficiaries transfers the interest to the grantee beneficiary or beneficiaries
effective only after the death of the last surviving grantor owner. If the last surviving joint tenant
owner did not execute the transfer on death deed, the deed is ineffective to transfer any interest and
the deed is void. An estate in joint tenancy is not severed or affected by the subsequent execution
of a transfer on death deed and the right of a surviving joint tenant owner who did not execute the
transfer on death deed shall prevail over a grantee beneficiary named in a transfer on death deed
unless the deed specifically states that it severs the joint tenancy ownership.
   Subd. 7. Execution by attorney-in-fact. A transfer on death deed may be executed by a duly
appointed attorney-in-fact pursuant to a power of attorney which grants the attorney-in-fact the
authority to execute deeds.
     Subd. 8. Recording requirements and authorization. A transfer on death deed is valid if the
deed is recorded in a county in which at least a part of the real property described in the deed is
located and is recorded before the death of the grantor owner upon whose death the conveyance or
transfer is effective. A transfer on death deed is not effective for purposes of section 507.34, 508.47,
or 508A.47 until the deed is recorded in the county in which the real property is located. When a
transfer on death deed is presented for recording, no certification by the county auditor as to transfer
of ownership and current and delinquent taxes shall be required or made and the transfer on death
deed shall not be required to be accompanied by a certificate of real estate value. A transfer on death
deed that otherwise satisfies all statutory requirements for recording may be recorded and shall be
accepted for recording in the county in which the property described in the deed is located. If any
part of the property described in the transfer on death deed is registered property, the registrar of
titles shall accept the transfer on death deed for recording only if at least one of the grantors who
executes the transfer on death deed appears of record to have an ownership interest in the property
described in the deed. No certification or approval of a transfer on death deed shall be required of
the examiner of titles prior to recording of the deed in the office of the registrar of titles.
    Subd. 9. Deed to trustee or other entity. A transfer on death deed may transfer an interest in
real property to the trustee of an inter vivos trust even if the trust is revocable, to the trustee of a
10274                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [116TH DAY

testamentary trust or to any other entity legally qualified to hold title to real property under the laws
of this state.
    Subd. 10. Revocation or modification of transfer on death deed. (a) A transfer on death deed
may be revoked at any time by the grantor owner or, if there is more than one grantor owner, by
any of the grantor owners. To be effective, the revocation must be recorded in the county in which
at least a part of the real property is located before the death of the grantor owner or owners who
execute the revocation. The revocation is not effective for purposes of section 507.34, 508.47, or
508A.47 until the revocation is recorded in the county in which the real property is located. Subject
to subdivision 6, if the real property is owned as joint tenants and if the revocation is not executed
by all of the grantor owners, the revocation is not effective unless executed by the last surviving
grantor owner.
    (b) If a grantor owner conveys to a third party, subsequent to the recording of the transfer on
death deed, by means other than a transfer on death deed, all or a part of such grantor owner's interest
in the property described in the transfer on death deed, no transfer of the conveyed interest shall
occur on such grantor owner's death and the transfer on death deed shall be ineffective as to the
conveyed or transferred interests, but the transfer on death deed remains effective with respect to
the conveyance or transfer on death of any other interests described in the transfer on death deed
owned by the grantor owner at the time of the grantor owner's death.
    (c) A transfer on death deed is a "governing instrument" within the meaning of section 524.2-804
and, except as may otherwise be specifically provided for in the transfer on death deed, is subject to
the same provisions as to revocation, revival, and nonrevocation set forth in section 524.2-804.
    Subd. 11. Antilapse; deceased beneficiary; words of survivorship. (a) If a grantee beneficiary
who is a grandparent or lineal descendant of a grandparent of the grantor owner fails to survive the
grantor owner, the issue of the deceased grantee beneficiary who survive the grantor owner take
in place of the deceased grantee beneficiary. If they are all of the same degree of kinship to the
deceased grantee beneficiary, they take equally. If they are of unequal degree, those of more remote
degree take by right of representation.
    (b) For the purposes of this subdivision, words of survivorship such as, in a conveyance to an
individual, "if he or she survives me," or, in a class gift, to "my surviving children," are a sufficient
indication of intent to condition the conveyance or transfer upon the beneficiary surviving the grantor
owner.
    Subd. 12. Lapse. If all beneficiaries and all successor beneficiaries, if any, designated in a transfer
on death deed, and also all successor beneficiaries who would take under the antilapse provisions of
subdivision 11, fail to survive the grantor owner or the last survivor of the grantor owners if there
are multiple grantor owners, if the beneficiary is a trust which has been revoked prior to the grantor
owner's death, or if the beneficiary is an entity no longer in existence at the grantor owner's death,
no transfer shall occur and the transfer on death deed is void.
    Subd. 13. Multiple transfer on death deeds. If a grantor owner executes and records more than
one transfer on death deed conveying the same interest in real property or a greater interest in the
real property, the transfer on death deed that has the latest acknowledgment date and that is recorded
before the death of the grantor owner upon whose death the conveyance or transfer is conditioned
is the effective transfer on death deed and all other transfer on death deeds, if any, executed by the
grantor owner or the grantor owners are ineffective to transfer any interest and are void.
116TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MAY 15, 2008                                        10275

    Subd. 14. Nonademption; unpaid proceeds of sale, condemnation, or insurance; sale by
conservator or guardian. If at the time of the death of the grantor owner upon whose death the
conveyance or transfer is stated to be effective, the grantor owner did not own a part or all of the real
property described in the transfer on death deed, no conveyance or transfer to the beneficiary of the
nonowned part of the real property shall occur upon the death of the grantor owner and the transfer
on death deed is void as to the nonowned part of the real property, but the beneficiary shall have
the same rights to unpaid proceeds of sale, condemnation or insurance, and, if sold by a conservator
or guardian of the grantor owner during the grantor owner's lifetime, the same rights to a general
pecuniary devise, as that of a specific devisee as set forth in section 524.2-606.
    Subd. 15. Nonexoneration. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision 3, a conveyance or
transfer under a transfer on death deed passes the described property subject to any mortgage or
security interest existing at the date of death of the grantor owner, without right of exoneration,
regardless of any statutory obligations to pay the grantor owner's debts upon death and regardless
of a general directive in the grantor owner's will to pay debts.
   Subd. 16. Disclaimer by beneficiary. A grantee beneficiary's interest under a transfer on death
deed may be disclaimed as provided in section 501B.86, or as otherwise provided by law.
     Subd. 17. Effect on other conveyances. This section does not prohibit other methods of
conveying property that are permitted by law and that have the effect of postponing ownership
or enjoyment of an interest in real property until the death of the owner. This section does not
invalidate any deed that is not a transfer on death deed and that is otherwise effective to convey
title to the interests and estates described in the deed that is not recorded until after the death of
the owner.
    Subd. 18. Notice, consent, and delivery not required. The signature, consent or agreement of,
or notice to, a grantee beneficiary under a transfer on death deed, or delivery of the transfer on death
deed to the grantee beneficiary, is not required for any purpose during the lifetime of the grantor
owner.
   Subd. 19. Nonrevocation by will. A transfer on death deed that is executed, acknowledged, and
recorded in accordance with this section is not revoked by the provisions of a will.
    Subd. 20. Proof of survivorship and clearance from public assistance claims and liens;
recording. An affidavit of identity and survivorship with a certified copy of a record of death as
an attachment may be combined with a clearance certificate under this section and the combined
documents may be recorded separately or as one document in each county in which the real estate
described in the clearance certificate is located. The affidavit, record of death, and clearance
certificate, whether combined or separate, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated in each,
and the registrar of titles may rely on the statements to transfer title to the property described in the
clearance certificate.
    Subd. 21. After-acquired property. Except as provided in this subdivision, a transfer on death
deed is not effective to transfer any interest in real property acquired by a grantor owner subsequent
to the date of signing of a transfer on death deed. A grantor owner may provide by specific language
in a transfer on death deed that the transfer on death deed will apply to any interest in the described
property acquired by the grantor owner after the signing or recording of the deed.
   Subd. 22. Anticipatory alienation prohibited. The interest of a grantee beneficiary under a
10276                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [116TH DAY

transfer on death deed which has not yet become effective is not subject to alienation; assignment;
encumbrance; appointment or anticipation by the beneficiary; garnishment; attachment; execution or
bankruptcy proceedings; claims for alimony, support, or maintenance; payment of other obligations
by any person against the beneficiary; or any other transfer, voluntary or involuntary, by or from
any beneficiary.
     Subd. 23. Clearance for public assistance claims and liens. Any person claiming an interest
in real property conveyed or transferred by a transfer on death deed, or the person's attorney or
other agent, may apply to the county agency in the county in which the real property is located for a
clearance certificate for the real property described in the transfer on death deed. The application for
a clearance certificate and the clearance certificate must contain the legal description of each parcel
of property covered by the clearance certificate. The county agency shall provide a sufficient number
of clearance certificates to allow a clearance certificate to be recorded in each county in which the
real property described in the transfer on death deed is located. The real property described in the
clearance certificate is bound by any conditions or other requirements imposed by the county agency
as specified in the clearance certificate. If the real property is registered property, a new certificate of
title must not be issued until the clearance certificate is recorded. If the clearance certificate shows
the continuation of a medical assistance claim or lien after issuance of the clearance certificate,
the real property remains subject to the claim or lien. If the real property is registered property,
the clearance certificate must be carried forward as a memorial in any new certificate of title. The
application shall contain the same information and shall be submitted, processed, and resolved in the
same manner and on the same terms and conditions as provided in section 525.313 for a clearance
certificate in a decree of descent proceeding, except that a copy of a notice of hearing does not
have to accompany the application. The application may contain a statement that the applicant, after
reasonably diligent inquiry, is not aware of the existence of a predeceased spouse or the existence
of a claim which could be recovered under section 246.53, 256B.15, 256D.16, 261.04, or 514.981.
If the county agency determines that a claim or lien exists under section 246.53, 256B.15, 256D.16,
261.04, or 514.981, the provisions of section 525.313 shall apply to collection, compromise, and
settlement of the claim or lien. A person claiming an interest in real property transferred or conveyed
by a transfer on death deed may petition or move the district court, as appropriate, in the county in
which the real property is located or in the county in which a probate proceeding affecting the estate
of the grantor of the transfer on death deed is pending, for an order allowing sale of the real property
free and clear of any public assistance claim or lien but subject to disposition of the sale proceeds
as provided in section 525.313. On a showing of good cause and subject to such notice as the court
may require, the court without hearing may issue an order allowing the sale free and clear of any
public assistance claim or lien on such terms and conditions as the court deems advisable to protect
the interests of the state or county agency.
    Subd. 24. Form of transfer on death deed. A transfer on death deed may be substantially in
the following form:
                                          Transfer on Death Deed

    Subd. 25. Form of instrument of revocation. An instrument of revocation may be substantially

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 508.52, is amended to read:
  508.52 CONVEYANCE; CANCELLATION OF OLD AND ISSUANCE OF NEW
CERTIFICATE.
    An owner of registered land who desires to convey the land, or a portion thereof, in fee, shall
execute a deed of conveyance, and fi     ­­e
                                          l­ record the deed with the registrar. The deed of conveyance
shall be fi
          ­­e ­ recorded and endorsed with the number and place of registration of the certificate
            l­d
of title. Before canceling the outstanding certificate of title the registrar shall show by memorial
thereon the registration of the deed on the basis of which it is canceled. The encumbrances, claims,
or interests adverse to the title of the registered owner shall be stated upon the new certificate, except
so far as they may be simultaneously released or discharged. The registrar shall not carry forward as
a memorial on the new certificate of title any memorials of a transfer on death deed if the grantors
of the transfer on death deed retain no fee interest in the land covered by the new certificate. The
10278                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [116TH DAY

certificate of title shall be marked "Canceled" by the registrar, who shall enter in the register a new
certificate of title to the grantee and prepare and deliver to the grantee a copy of the new certificate
of title. If a deed in fee is for a portion of the land described in a certificate of title, the memorial
of the deed entered by the registrar shall include the legal description contained in the deed and the
registrar shall enter a new certificate of title to the grantee for the portion of the land conveyed and,
except as otherwise provided in this section, issue a residue certificate of title to the grantor for the
portion of the land not conveyed. The registrar shall prepare and deliver to each of the parties a
copy of their respective certificates of title. In lieu of canceling the grantor's certificate of title and
issuing a residue certificate to the grantor for the portion of the land not conveyed, the registrar may
if the grantor's deed does not divide a parcel of unplatted land, and in the absence of a request to the
contrary by the registered owner, mark by the land description on the certificate of title "Part of land
conveyed, see memorials." The fee for a residue certificate of title shall be paid to the registrar only
when the grantor's certificate of title is canceled after the conveyance by the grantor of a portion
of the land described in the grantor's certificate of title. When two or more successive conveyances
of the same property are filed for registration on the same day the registrar may enter a certificate
in favor of the grantee or grantees in the last of the successive conveyances, and the memorial of
the previous deed or deeds entered on the prior certificate of title shall have the same force and
effect as though the prior certificate of title had been entered in favor of the grantee or grantees in
the earlier deed or deeds in the successive conveyances. The fees for the registration of the earlier
deed or deeds shall be the same as the fees prescribed for the entry of memorials. The registrar of
titles, with the consent of the transferee, may mark "See memorials for new owner(s)" by the names
of the registered owners on the certificate of title and also add to the memorial of the transferring
conveyance a statement that the memorial shall serve in lieu of a new certificate of title in favor of
the grantee or grantees therein noted and may refrain from canceling the certificate of title until the
time it is canceled by a subsequent transfer, and the memorial showing such transfer of title shall
have the same effect as the entry of a new certificate of title for the land described in the certificate
of title; the fee for the registration of a conveyance without cancellation of the certificate of title
shall be the same as the fee prescribed for the entry of a memorial.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 508A.52, is amended to read:
   508A.52 CONVEYANCE; CANCELLATION OF OLD AND ISSUANCE OF NEW CPT.
    An owner of land registered under sections 508A.01 to 508A.85 who desires to convey the
land, or a portion of it, in fee, shall execute a deed of conveyance, and fi­­e
                                                                              l­ record the deed with
the registrar. The deed of conveyance shall be fi  ­­e
                                                    l­d­ recorded and endorsed with the number and
place of registration of the CPT. Before canceling the outstanding CPT, the registrar shall show by
memorial on it the registration of the deed on the basis of which it is canceled. The encumbrances,
claims, or interests adverse to the title of the registered owner shall be stated upon the new CPT,
except so far as they may be simultaneously released or discharged. The registrar shall not carry
forward as a memorial on the new CPT any memorials of a transfer on death deed if the grantors of
the transfer on death deed retain no fee interest in the real property covered by the new CPT. The
CPT shall be marked "Canceled" by the registrar, who shall enter in the register a new CPT to the
grantee, and prepare and deliver to the grantee a copy of the new CPT. If a deed in fee is for a portion
of the land described in a CPT, the memorial of the deed entered by the registrar shall include the
legal description contained in the deed and the registrar shall enter a new CPT to the grantee for
the portion of the land conveyed and, except as otherwise provided in this section, issue a residue
CPT to the grantor for the portion of the land not conveyed. The registrar shall prepare and deliver

to each of the parties a copy of their respective C­P­T
                                                      ­­s CPT's. In lieu of canceling the grantor's CPT
and issuing a residue CPT to the grantor for the portion of the land not conveyed, the registrar may
if the grantor's deed does not divide a parcel of unplatted land, and in the absence of a request to the
contrary by the registered owner, mark by the land description on the CPT "Part of land conveyed,
see memorials." The fee for a residue CPT shall be paid to the registrar only when the grantor's CPT
is canceled after the conveyance by the grantor of a portion of the land described in the grantor's
CPT. When two or more successive conveyances of the same property are filed for registration on
the same day the registrar may enter a CPT in favor of the grantee or grantees in the last of the
successive conveyances, and the memorial of the previous deed or deeds entered on the prior CPT
shall have the same force and effect as though the prior CPT had been entered in favor of the grantee
or grantees in the earlier deed or deeds in the successive conveyances. The fees for the registration
of the earlier deed or deeds shall be the same as the fees prescribed for the entry of memorials. The
registrar of titles, with the consent of the transferee, may mark "See memorials for new owner(s)"
by the names of the registered owners on the CPT and also add to the memorial of the transferring
conveyance a statement that the memorial shall serve in lieu of a new CPT in favor of the grantee
or grantees noted in it and may refrain from canceling the CPT until the time it is canceled by a
subsequent transfer, and the memorial showing the transfer of title shall have the same effect as the
entry of a new CPT for the land described in the CPT. The fee for the registration of a conveyance
without cancellation of the CPT shall be the same as the fee prescribed for the entry of a memorial.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 524.2-702, is amended to read:
  524.2-702 REQUIREMENT OF SURVIVAL FOR 120 HOURS FOR DEVISEES,
BENEFICIARIES OF CERTAIN TRUSTS, AND APPOINTEES OF CERTAIN POWERS
OF APPOINTMENT; SIMULTANEOUS DEATH ACT FOR OTHER CASES.
    (a) Requirement of survival for 120 hours. A beneficiary of a trust in which the grantor has
reserved a power to alter, amend, revoke, or terminate the provisions of the trust who fails to survive
the grantor by 120 hours, a devisee who fails to survive the testator by 120 hours, a beneficiary named
in a transfer on death deed under section 507.071 who fails to survive by 120 hours the grantor owner
upon whose death the conveyance to the beneficiary becomes effective, or an appointee of a power
of appointment taking effect at the death of the holder of the power who fails to survive the holder
of the power by 120 hours is deemed to have predeceased the grantor, grantor owner testator, or
holder of the power for purposes of determining title to property passing by the trust instrument, by
the testator's will, by the transfer on death deed, or by the exercise of the power of appointment.
    (b)(1) Title to property in other cases. In cases not governed by section 524.2-104 or paragraph
(a), where the title to property or the devolution thereof depends upon priority of death and there
is no sufficient evidence that the persons have died otherwise than simultaneously, the property of
each person shall be disposed of as if the person had survived, except as provided otherwise in this
paragraph.
    (2) Division of property. Where two or more beneficiaries are designated to take successively
by reason of survivorship under another person's disposition of property and there is no sufficient
evidence that these beneficiaries have died otherwise than simultaneously the property thus disposed
of shall be divided into as many equal portions as there are successive beneficiaries and these
portions shall be distributed respectively to those who would have taken in the event that each
designated beneficiary had survived.

    (3) Division of property. Where there is no sufficient evidence that two joint tenants or tenants
by the entirety have died otherwise than simultaneously the property so held shall be distributed
one-half as if one had survived and one-half as if the other had survived. If there are more than two
joint tenants and all of them have so died the property thus distributed shall be in the proportion that
one bears to the whole number of joint tenants.
    (4) Division of property. Where the insured and the beneficiary in a policy of life or accident
insurance have died and there is no sufficient evidence that they have died otherwise than
simultaneously the proceeds of the policy shall be distributed as if the insured had survived the
beneficiary.
    (c) Not retroactive. This section does not apply to the distribution of the property of a person
who has died before it takes effect. Paragraph (a) applies only to persons who die on or after August
1, 1999.
    (d) Application. This section does not apply in the case of wills, trusts, deeds, contracts of
insurance, or documents exercising powers of appointment wherein provision has been made for
distribution of property different from the provisions of this section. Paragraph (a) does not apply to
trusts which are part of a qualified or nonqualified retirement plan or individual retirement accounts.

entitled to be recorded shall be recorded if the acknowledgment made in a representative capacity
is substantially in the form prescribed in chapter 358, without further inquiry into the authority of
the person making the acknowledgment.
    (b)(1) Any electronic instruments, including signatures and seals, affecting real estate may only
be recorded as part of a pilot project for the electronic filing of real estate documents implemented
by the task force created in Laws 2000, chapter 391, or by the Electronic Real Estate Recording Task
Force created under section 507.094. The Electronic Real Estate Recording Task Force created under

The filing of such lis pendens at the time of filing the complaint and before the commencement of
the action shall have no force, effect, or validity against the premises described in the lis pendens,
unless the filing of the complaint is followed by the service of the summons in the action within 90
days after the filing of the complaint therein. Any party claiming any title or interest in or to the real
property involved or affected may on such notice as the court shall in each case prescribe, make
application to the district court in the county in which the action is pending or in which the real
property involved or affected is situated, for an order discharging the lis pendens of record, when
any such action has not been brought on for trial within two years after the filing of the lis pendens
and in case the court orders the lis pendens discharged of record upon the filing of a certified copy
of the order of the court in the office of the county recorder, where the real property is situated, the
lis pendens shall be void and of no force nor effect.

      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 524.2-402, is amended to read:
      524.2-402 DESCENT OF HOMESTEAD.
   (a) If there is a surviving spouse, the homestead, including a manufactured home which is the
family residence, descends free from any testamentary or other disposition of it to which the spouse
has not consented in writing or as provided by law, as follows:
      (1) if there is no surviving descendant of decedent, to the spouse; or
   (2) if there are surviving descendants of decedent, then to the spouse for the term of the spouse's
natural life and the remainder in equal shares to the decedent's descendants by representation.
116TH DAY]                                                THURSDAY, MAY 15, 2008                                                                            10285

    (b) If there is no surviving spouse and the homestead has not been disposed of by will it descends
as other real estate.
     (c) If the homestead passes by descent or will to the spouse or decedent's descendants or to a
trustee of a trust of which the spouse or the decedent's descendants are the sole current beneficiaries,
it is exempt from all debts which were not valid charges on it at the time of decedent's death except
that the homestead is subject to a claim filed pursuant to section 246.53 for state hospital care or
256B.15 for medical assistance benefits. If the homestead passes to a person other than a spouse or
decedent's descendants or to a trustee of a trust of which the spouse or the decedent's descendants
are the sole current beneficiaries, it is subject to the payment of expenses of administration, funeral
expenses, expenses of last illness, taxes, and debts. The claimant may seek to enforce a lien or other
charge against a homestead so exempted by an appropriate action in the district court.
    (d) For purposes of this section, except as provided in section 524.2-301, the surviving spouse
is deemed to consent to any testamentary or other disposition of the homestead to which the spouse
has not previously consented in writing unless the spouse files in the manner provided in section
524.2-211, paragraph (f), a petition that asserts the homestead rights provided to the spouse by this
section.
      Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 524.3-801, is amended to read:
      524.3-801 NOTICE TO CREDITORS.
    (a) Unless notice has already been given under this section, upon appointment of a general
personal representative in informal proceedings or upon the filing of a petition for formal
appointment of a general personal representative, notice thereof, in the form prescribed by court
rule, shall be given under the direction of the court administrator by publication once a week for
two successive weeks in a legal newspaper in the county wherein the proceedings are pending
giving the name and address of the general personal representative and notifying creditors of the
estate to present their claims within four months after the date of the court administrator's notice
which is subsequently published or be forever barred, unless they are entitled to further service of
notice under paragraph (b) or (c).

    (d)(1) Effective for decedents dying on or after July 1, 1997, if the decedent or a predeceased
spouse of the decedent received assistance for which a claim could be filed under section
246.53, 256B.15, 256D.16, or 261.04, the personal representative or the attorney for the personal
representative shall serve the commissioner of human services with notice in the manner prescribed
in paragraph (c) as soon as practicable after the appointment of the personal representative. The
notice must state the decedent's full name, date of birth, and Social Security number and, to the
extent then known after making a reasonably diligent inquiry, the full name, date of birth, and
Social Security number for each of the decedent's predeceased spouses. The notice may also
contain a statement that, after making a reasonably diligent inquiry, the personal representative
has determined that the decedent did not have any predeceased spouses or that the personal
representative has been unable to determine one or more of the previous items of information for a
predeceased spouse of the decedent. A copy of the notice to creditors must be attached to and be a
part of the notice to the commissioner.
    (2) Notwithstanding a will or other instrument or law to the contrary, except as allowed in this
paragraph, no property subject to administration by the estate may be distributed by the estate or
the personal representative until 70 days after the date the notice is served on the commissioner
as provided in paragraph (c), unless the local agency consents as provided for in clause (6). This
restriction on distribution does not apply to the personal representative's sale of real or personal
property, but does apply to the net proceeds the estate receives from these sales. The personal
representative, or any person with personal knowledge of the facts, may provide an affidavit
containing the description of any real or personal property affected by this paragraph and stating
facts showing compliance with this paragraph. If the affidavit describes real property, it may be
filed or recorded in the office of the county recorder or registrar of titles for the county where the
real property is located. This paragraph does not apply to proceedings under sections 524.3-1203
and 525.31, or when a duly authorized agent of a county is acting as the personal representative
of the estate.
116TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MAY 15, 2008                                       10287

    (3) At any time before an order or decree is entered under section 524.3-1001 or 524.3-1002,
or a closing statement is filed under section 524.3-1003, the personal representative or the attorney
for the personal representative may serve an amended notice on the commissioner to add variations
or other names of the decedent or a predeceased spouse named in the notice, the name of a
predeceased spouse omitted from the notice, to add or correct the date of birth or Social Security
number of a decedent or predeceased spouse named in the notice, or to correct any other deficiency
in a prior notice. The amended notice must state the decedent's name, date of birth, and Social
Security number, the case name, case number, and district court in which the estate is pending, and
the date the notice being amended was served on the commissioner. If the amendment adds the
name of a predeceased spouse omitted from the notice, it must also state that spouse's full name,
date of birth, and Social Security number. The amended notice must be served on the commissioner
in the same manner as the original notice. Upon service, the amended notice relates back to and is
effective from the date the notice it amends was served, and the time for filing claims arising under
section 246.53, 256B.15, 256D.16 or 261.04 is extended by 60 days from the date of service of the
amended notice. Claims filed during the 60-day period are undischarged and unbarred claims, may
be prosecuted by the entities entitled to file those claims in accordance with section 524.3-1004,
and the limitations in section 524.3-1006 do not apply. The personal representative or any person
with personal knowledge of the facts may provide and file or record an affidavit in the same manner
as provided for in clause (1).
     (4) Within one year after the date an order or decree is entered under section 524.3-1001 or
524.3-1002 or a closing statement is filed under section 524.3-1003, any person who has an interest
in property that was subject to administration by the estate may serve an amended notice on the
commissioner to add variations or other names of the decedent or a predeceased spouse named in the
notice, the name of a predeceased spouse omitted from the notice, to add or correct the date of birth
or Social Security number of a decedent or predeceased spouse named in the notice, or to correct
any other deficiency in a prior notice. The amended notice must be served on the commissioner in
the same manner as the original notice and must contain the information required for amendments
under clause (3). If the amendment adds the name of a predeceased spouse omitted from the notice,
it must also state that spouse's full name, date of birth, and Social Security number. Upon service,
the amended notice relates back to and is effective from the date the notice it amends was served. If
the amended notice adds the name of an omitted predeceased spouse or adds or corrects the Social
Security number or date of birth of the decedent or a predeceased spouse already named in the
notice, then, notwithstanding any other laws to the contrary, claims against the decedent's estate on
account of those persons resulting from the amendment and arising under section 246.53, 256B.15,
256D.16, or 261.04 are undischarged and unbarred claims, may be prosecuted by the entities entitled
to file those claims in accordance with section 524.3-1004, and the limitations in section 524.3-1006
do not apply. The person filing the amendment or any other person with personal knowledge of the
facts may provide and file or record an affidavit describing affected real or personal property in the
same manner as clause (1).
    (5) After one year from the date an order or decree is entered under section 524.3-1001 or
524.3-1002, or a closing statement is filed under section 524.3-1003, no error, omission, or defect of
any kind in the notice to the commissioner required under this paragraph or in the process of service
of the notice on the commissioner, or the failure to serve the commissioner with notice as required
by this paragraph, makes any distribution of property by a personal representative void or voidable.
The distributee's title to the distributed property shall be free of any claims based upon a failure to
comply with this paragraph.

    (6) The local agency may consent to a personal representative's request to distribute property
subject to administration by the estate to distributees during the 70-day period after service of
notice on the commissioner. The local agency may grant or deny the request in whole or in part and
may attach conditions to its consent as it deems appropriate. When the local agency consents to a
distribution, it shall give the estate a written certificate evidencing its consent to the early distribution
of assets at no cost. The certificate must include the name, case number, and district court in which
the estate is pending, the name of the local agency, describe the specific real or personal property
to which the consent applies, state that the local agency consents to the distribution of the specific
property described in the consent during the 70-day period following service of the notice on the
commissioner, state that the consent is unconditional or list all of the terms and conditions of the
consent, be dated, and may include other contents as may be appropriate. The certificate must be
signed by the director of the local agency or the director's designees and is effective as of the date it
is dated unless it provides otherwise. The signature of the director or the director's designee does not
require any acknowledgment. The certificate shall be prima facie evidence of the facts it states, may
be attached to or combined with a deed or any other instrument of conveyance and, when so attached
or combined, shall constitute a single instrument. If the certificate describes real property, it shall be
accepted for recording or filing by the county recorder or registrar of titles in the county in which the
property is located. If the certificate describes real property and is not attached to or combined with
a deed or other instrument of conveyance, it shall be accepted for recording or filing by the county
recorder or registrar of titles in the county in which the property is located. The certificate constitutes
a waiver of the 70-day period provided for in clause (2) with respect to the property it describes and
is prima facie evidence of service of notice on the commissioner. The certificate is not a waiver or
relinquishment of any claims arising under section 246.53, 256B.15, 256D.16, or 261.04, and does
not otherwise constitute a waiver of any of the personal representative's duties under this paragraph.
Distributees who receive property pursuant to a consent to an early distribution shall remain liable
to creditors of the estate as provided for by law.
    (7) All affidavits provided for under this paragraph:
    (i) shall be provided by persons who have personal knowledge of the facts stated in the affidavit;
    (ii) may be filed or recorded in the office of the county recorder or registrar of titles in the county
in which the real property they describe is located for the purpose of establishing compliance with
the requirements of this paragraph; and
    (iii) are prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the affidavit.
    (8) This paragraph applies to the estates of decedents dying on or after July 1, 1997. Clause (5)
also applies with respect to all notices served on the commissioner of human services before July 1,
1997, under Laws 1996, chapter 451, article 2, section 55. All notices served on the commissioner
before July 1, 1997, pursuant to Laws 1996, chapter 451, article 2, section 55, shall be deemed
to be legally sufficient for the purposes for which they were intended, notwithstanding any errors,
omissions or other defects.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 524.3-803, is amended to read:
    524.3-803 LIMITATIONS ON PRESENTATION OF CLAIMS.

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 580.02, is amended to read:
   580.02 REQUISITES FOR FORECLOSURE.
   To entitle any party to make such foreclosure, it is requisite:
   (1) that some default in a condition of such mortgage has occurred, by which the power to sell
has become operative;
    (2) that no action or proceeding has been instituted at law to recover the debt then remaining
secured by such mortgage, or any part thereof, or, if the action or proceeding has been instituted,
that the same has been discontinued, or that an execution upon the judgment rendered therein has
been returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part;
    (3) that the mortgage has been recorded and, if it has been assigned, that all assignments thereof
have been recorded; provided, that, if the mortgage is upon registered land, it shall be sufficient if
the mortgage and all assignments thereof have been duly registered; and
   (4) before the notice of pendency as required under section 580.032 is recorded, the party has
complied with section 580.021.
   Sec. 7. [580.021] FORECLOSURE PREVENTION COUNSELING.
   Subdivision 1. Applicability. This section applies to foreclosure of mortgages under this chapter
on property consisting of one to four family dwelling units, one of which the owner occupies as the
owner's principal place of residency on the date of service of the notice of sale of the owner.
    Subd. 2. Requirement to provide notice of opportunity for counseling. When the written
notice required under section 47.20, subdivision 8, is provided and before the notice of pendency
under section 580.032, subdivision 3, is filed, a party foreclosing on a mortgage must provide to the
mortgagor information contained in a form prescribed in section 580.022, subdivision 1, that:
   (1) foreclosure prevention counseling services provided by an authorized foreclosure prevention
counseling agency are available; and
    (2) notice that the party will transmit the homeowner's name, address, and telephone number to
an approved foreclosure prevention agency.
   Nothing in this subdivision prohibits the notices required by this subdivision from being
provided concurrently with the written notice required under section 47.20, subdivision 8.
    For the purposes of this section, an "authorized foreclosure prevention counseling agency"
is a nonprofit agency approved by the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency or the United States
Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide foreclosure prevention counseling
services.
   Subd. 3. Notification to authorized counseling agency. The party entitled to foreclose shall,
116TH DAY]                        THURSDAY, MAY 15, 2008                                   10293

within one week of sending the notice prescribed in section 580.022, provide to the appropriate
authorized foreclosure prevention agency the mortgagor's name, address, and most recent known
telephone number.
    Subd. 4. Notice of provision of counseling; request for contact information. (a) An
authorized foreclosure prevention agency that contacts or is contacted by a mortgagor or the
mortgagor's authorized representative and agrees to provide foreclosure prevention assistance
services to the mortgagor or representative must provide the form prescribed in section 580.022
to the mortgagee. The form serves as notice to the mortgagee that the mortgagor is receiving
foreclosure prevention counseling assistance.
   (b) The mortgagee must return the form to the authorized foreclosure prevention agency within
15 days of receipt of the form with the name and telephone number of the mortgagee's agent. The
agent must be a person authorized by the mortgagee to:
   (1) discuss with the authorized foreclosure prevention agency or the mortgagor the terms of the
mortgage; and
   (2) negotiate any resolution to the mortgagor's default.
   (c) Nothing in this subdivision requires a mortgagee to reach a resolution relating to the
mortgagor's default.

which the notice under section 47.20, subdivision 8, is sent on or after that date.

        Remember: It is important that you learn as much as you can about foreclosure and your
        situation. Find out about all your options before you make any agreements with anyone about
        the foreclosure of your home.
        Getting Help
        As soon as possible, you should contact your lender at the above number to talk about things
        you might be able to do to prevent foreclosure. You should also consider contacting the
        foreclosure prevention counselor in your area. A foreclosure prevention counselor can answer
        your questions, offer free advice, and help you create a plan which makes sense for your
        situation.
        Contact the Minnesota Home Ownership Center at 651-659-9336 or 866-462-6466 or
        www.hocmn.org to get the phone number and location of the nearest counseling organization.
        Call today. The longer you wait, the fewer options you may have for a desirable result.
        Information About the Foreclosure Process
        You do not need to move at the time of the sheriff's sale. After the sheriff's sale you have
        the right to "redeem." Redeem means that you pay off the entire loan amount plus fees to
        keep your house. You can keep living in your home for a period of time. This is called a
        "redemption period." The redemption period is [insert number of months] months after the
        sheriff's sale. This redemption period is your chance to try and sell your home or refinance
        it with a different loan. You can also pay the redemption amount with any other funds you
        have available. At the end of the redemption period you will have to leave your home. If you
        do not, the person or company that bid on your home at the sheriff's sale has the right to file
        an eviction against you in district court."
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2008, and applies to notices of sale

                                         "Foreclosure: Advice to Tenants

notice about the foreclosure process. Please read it carefully.
     The mortgage foreclosure does not change the terms of your lease. You and your landlord
must continue to follow the terms of your lease, including the rights and responsibilities of
you and your landlord. You must keep paying rent unless you have a legal reason to withhold
it. Your landlord must keep the property repaired. Utilities must be paid under the terms of
your lease or under state law.
    Moving out of the property early might be a violation of your lease. The date of the sheriff's
foreclosure sale is in the attached foreclosure notice. In most cases you do not need to move from
the property before the sheriff's foreclosure sale. Read your lease to see if it says anything about
foreclosure and about the rights you may have if the property is in foreclosure. If you have a
month-to-month lease, the foreclosure notice does not change the rules for ending your lease. You
and your landlord must still give legal notice to end your lease.
    In most cases, your landlord has six months after the date of the sheriff's foreclosure sale to pay
off the mortgage. This is called the "redemption period." Read the attached foreclosure notice to
determine the length of the redemption period. You cannot be asked to move during the redemption
period except for lease violations or if your lease expires during the redemption period. If your
landlord stops the foreclosure, you may not have to move from the property. If your landlord does
not stop the foreclosure, there will be a new owner of the property at the end of the redemption
period.
    The new owner may have the legal right to ask you to move even if your lease is not over. But,
the new owner must still give you a written notice stating that the new owner wants you to move.

or some part of it, subsequent to the foreclosed mortgage, may redeem within seven days after
the expiration of the redemption period determined under section 580.23 or 582.032, whichever is
applicable; and each subsequent creditor having a lien may redeem, in the order of priority of their
respective liens, within seven days after the time allowed the prior lienholder by paying the amount
required under this section. However, no creditor is entitled to redeem unless, w ­­t

money judgment necessary to create the lien; and

sale or the sheriff's successor in office a copy of each of the documents required to be recorded under
clauses (1) and (2), with the office, date and time of filing for record stated on the first page of each
document.
    The sheriff shall maintain for public inspection all documents delivered to the sheriff and shall
note the date of delivery on each document. The sheriff may charge a fee of $100 for the documents
delivered to the sheriff relating to each lien. The sheriff shall maintain copies of documents delivered
to the sheriff for a period of six months after the end of the mortgagor's redemption period.
    (b) Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and the first day following the expiration of the prior
redemption period must be included in computing the seven-day redemption period. When the
last day of the period falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, that day must be omitted from
the computation. The order of redemption by judgment creditors subsequent to the foreclosed
mortgage shall be determined by the order in which their judgments were entered as memorials
on the certificate of title for the foreclosed premises or docketed in the office of the district
court administrator if the property is not registered under chapter 508 or 508A, regardless of the
homestead status of the property. All mechanic's lienholders who have coordinate liens shall have
one combined seven-day period to redeem.
    (c) The amount required to redeem from the holder of the sheriff's certificate of sale is the amount
required under section 580.23. The amount required to redeem from a person holding a certificate
of redemption is:
    (1) the amount paid to redeem as shown on the certificate of redemption; plus
    (2) interest on that amount to the date of redemption; plus
    (3) the amount claimed due on the person's lien, as shown on the affidavit under section 580.25,
clause (3).
    The amount required to redeem may be paid to the holder of the sheriff's certificate of sale or
the certificate of redemption, as the case may be, or to the sheriff for the holder.

creditors in which the mortgagor's redemption period expires on or after August 8, 2008.

of redemption and any related service. No other fee may be charged by the sheriff for a redemption.
    Within 24 hours after a redemption is made, the person redeeming shall cause the documents
so required to be produced to be fi

may receive fees as prescribed in section 357.18 or 508.82. If the redemption is made at any place
other than the county seat, it is sufficient forthwith to deposit the documents in the nearest post
office, addressed to the recorder or registrar of titles, with the postage prepaid. A person recording
documents produced for redemption shall, on the same day, deliver copies of the documents to the
sheriff for public inspection. The sheriff may receive a fee of $20 for the documents delivered
following a redemption. The sheriff shall note the date of delivery on the documents and shall
maintain for public inspection all documents delivered to the sheriff for a period of six months
after the end of the mortgagor's redemption period.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2008, and applies to redemptions made
on or after that date.
     Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 580.28, is amended to read:
     580.28 ACTION TO SET ASIDE MORTGAGE; FORECLOSURE; REDEMPTION.
    When an action is brought wherein it is claimed that any mortgage as to the plaintiff or person
for whose benefit the action is brought is fraudulent or void, or has been paid or discharged, in
whole or in part, or the relative priority or the validity of liens is disputed, if such mortgage has
been foreclosed by advertisement, and the time for redemption from the foreclosure sale will expire
before final judgment in such action, the plaintiff or beneficiary having the right to redeem, for the
purpose of saving such right in case the action fails, may deposit with the sheriff before the time of
redemption expires the amount for which the mortgaged premises were sold, with interest thereon to
the time of deposit, together with a bond to the holder of the sheriff's certificate of sale, in an amount
and with sureties to be approved by the sheriff, conditioned to pay all interest that may accrue or be
allowed on such deposit if the action fail. The person shall, in writing, notify such sheriff that the
person claims the mortgage to be fraudulent or void, or to have been paid or discharged, in whole or

in part, as the case may be, and that such action is pending, and direct the sheriff to retain such money
and bond until final judgment. In case such action fails, such deposit shall operate as a redemption
of the premises from such foreclosure sale, and entitle the plaintiff to a certificate thereof. Such
foreclosure, deposit, bond, and notice shall be brought to the attention of the court by supplemental
complaint in the action, and the judgment shall determine the validity of the foreclosure sale, and
the rights of the parties to the moneys and bond so deposited, which shall be paid and delivered by
the sheriff as directed by such judgment upon delivery to the sheriff of a certified copy thereof. The
remedy herein provided shall be in addition to other remedies now existing.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 580.30, is amended to read:
   580.30 MORTGAGES, WHEN REINSTATED.
    Subdivision 1. Reinstatement. In any proceedings for the foreclosure of a real estate mortgage,
whether by action or by advertisement, if at any time before the sale of the premises under such
foreclosure the mortgagor, the owner, or any holder of any subsequent encumbrance or lien, or any
one for them, shall pay or cause to be paid to the holder of the mortgage so being foreclosed, or to
the attorney foreclosing the same, or to the sheriff of the county, the amount actually due thereon
and constituting the default actually existing in the conditions of the mortgage at the time of the
commencement of the foreclosure proceedings, including insurance, delinquent taxes, if any, upon
the premises, interest to date of payment, cost of publication and services of process or notices,
attorney's fees not exceeding $150 or one-half of the attorney's fees authorized by section 582.01,
whichever is greater, together with other lawful disbursements necessarily incurred in connection
with the proceedings by the party foreclosing, then, and in that event, the mortgage shall be fully
reinstated and further proceedings in such foreclosure shall be thereupon abandoned.
    Subd. 2. Request by sheriff. Upon written request by the sheriff, the holder of the mortgage
or the holder's legal representative shall provide to the sheriff within seven days of the date of
the request by the sheriff to the foreclosing attorney: (1) the current payoff amount, showing
outstanding principal, interest, and a daily interest accrual amount, (2) an itemized schedule of the
current amounts necessary to reinstate the mortgage, and (3) the identity of the person or entity
with authority to act on behalf of the holder of the mortgage or the holder's legal representative.
If the holder of the mortgage or the holder's legal representative fails to respond to the sheriff's
request within seven days of the date of the request, the sheriff shall postpone the sheriff's sale and
the sheriff shall announce at the sheriff's sale the postponement of the sale. The postponement does
not need to be published. If the request by the sheriff is made seven days or less before the sheriff's
sale, the holder of the mortgage or the holder's representative shall make a good faith effort to
respond to the sheriff before the sheriff's sale, but the sheriff may conduct the sheriff's sale without
a response from the holder of the mortgage or the holder's legal representative.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2008, and applies to sheriff's sales
scheduled to occur on or after that date.
   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 581.10, is amended to read:

                                ­n
sale was held at any time prior to expiration of the mortgagor's redemption period. Upon written
request by the sheriff, the holder of the sheriff's certificate or certificate of redemption shall provide
an affidavit of allowable costs to the sheriff within seven days of the date of the request by the
sheriff. If the mortgagor does not redeem within seven days after the affidavit is filed, the holder of
the sheriff's certificate may file a supplemental affidavit if additional allowable costs are incurred
during the redemption period. If the holder of the sheriff's certificate or certificate of redemption
fails to respond to the sheriff's request within seven days, the sheriff may calculate a redemption
amount pursuant to section 580.23, subdivision 1, and issue a certificate of redemption for that

amount. If the time allowed to redeem is less than seven days from the expiration of the redemption
period, the sheriff shall make a reasonable effort to request the affidavit of allowable costs in
writing from the holder of the sheriff's certificate, its agent, or attorney before issuing a certificate
of redemption. If the affidavit of allowable costs is not provided more than one business day before
the expiration of the redemption period, at any time one business day or less before the expiration
of the redemption period, the sheriff may calculate a redemption amount pursuant to section
580.23, subdivision 1, and issue a certificate of redemption for that amount. The amount calculated
by the sheriff, absent malfeasance by the sheriff, binds the holder of the sheriff's certificate even if
the amount calculated by the sheriff is less than the actual amount due.
    Subd. 3. Penalty for excessive costs. At any time within one year after the expiration of the
mortgagor's redemption period, the redeeming party, heirs, or assigns may recover from the holder
of the sheriff's certificate three times the amount of any sums declared as costs or disbursements
on the affidavit of allowable costs but not actually paid by the holder, or three times the amount of
any sums determined to exceed a reasonable cost for the declared item where the excess has been
retained by the lender, unless the disputed amounts are paid to the redeeming party, heirs, or assigns
prior to entry of judgment.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2008, and applies to redemptions made
on or after that date.
   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 582.031, is amended to read:
   582.031 LIMITED RIGHT OF ENTRY.
     Subdivision 1. Right of entry. If premises described in a mortgage or sheriff's certificate are
vacant or unoccupied, the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate or the holder's agents and
contractors may, but is under no obligation to, enter upon the premises to protect the premises
from waste, until the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate receives notice that the premises
are occupied. The holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate does not become a mortgagee in
possession by taking actions authorized under this section. An affidavit of the sheriff, the holder
of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate, or a person acting on behalf of the holder, describing the
premises and stating that the same are vacant or unoccupied, is prima facie evidence of the facts
stated in the affidavit and is entitled to be recorded in the office of the county recorder or the registrar
of titles in the county where the premises are located, if it contains a legal description of the premises.
    Subd. 2. Authorized actions. The holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate may take the
following actions to protect the premises from waste:  ­ or from falling below minimum community
standards for public safety and sanitation: make reasonable periodic inspections, install or change
locks on doors and windows, board windows, install an alarm system, ­    p­ro

and otherwise prevent or minimize damage to the premises from the elements, vandalism, trespass,
or other illegal activities. If the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate installs or changes
locks under this section, a key to the premises must be promptly delivered to the mortgagor or any
person lawfully claiming through the mortgagor, upon request.
    Subd. 3. Costs. All costs incurred by the holder of the mortgage to protect the premises from
waste or from falling below minimum community standards for public safety and sanitation may be
added to the principal balance of the mortgage. The costs may bear interest to the extent provided in
the mortgage and may be added to the redemption price if the costs are incurred after a foreclosure

either of those plans. The agreement may contain provisions that vary from those of paragraph (d)
to conform to the benefit sets or other terms under section 43A.23 or 43A.316. The agreement may
also provide that the pool and the commissioner will jointly solicit bids for use of provider networks,
claims processing, and other administrative services. If an agreement is entered into, persons covered
through the pool must continue to be rated separately for premium purposes from persons covered
under section 43A.23 or 43A.316. An agreement under this paragraph must not result in the pool
becoming self-insured or in the pool sharing risk with a plan offered by the commissioner. The pool
