the activities and programs identified by the advisory committee established under subdivision 2
and recommended to the commissioner of public safety. The commissioner shall not expend funds

     (b) The commissioner may make grants annually to fire departments from the money authorized
by the revenues appropriated from the fire safety account to qualifying fire departments. These grants
must be for the activities and programs, including training, that are recommended by the fire service
advisory committee established under subdivision 2. The commissioner may make block grants.
Block grants must be awarded on a per-firefighter basis and these funds must be used for the purpose
of firefighter training. The commissioner shall consult with the fire service advisory committee in

be a $12 surcharge. When a defendant is convicted of more than one offense in a case, the surcharge
shall be imposed only once in that case. In the Second Judicial District, the court shall impose,
and the court administrator shall collect, an additional $1 surcharge on every person convicted of
any felony, gross misdemeanor, misdemeanor, or petty misdemeanor offense, including a violation
of a law or ordinance relating to vehicle parking, if the Ramsey County Board of Commissioners
authorizes the $1 surcharge. The surcharge shall be imposed whether or not the person is sentenced
to imprisonment or the sentence is stayed. The surcharge shall not be imposed when a person is
convicted of a petty misdemeanor for which no fine is imposed.
   (b) If the court fails to impose a surcharge as required by this subdivision, the court administrator
shall show the imposition of the surcharge, collect the surcharge, and correct the record.
    (c) The court may not waive payment of the surcharge required under this subdivision. Upon
a showing of indigency or undue hardship upon the convicted person or the convicted person's
immediate family, the sentencing court may authorize payment of the surcharge in installments.
   (d) The court administrator or other entity collecting a surcharge shall forward it to the
commissioner of management and budget.
    (e) If the convicted person is sentenced to imprisonment and has not paid the surcharge before
the term of imprisonment begins, the chief executive officer of the correctional facility in which the
convicted person is incarcerated shall collect the surcharge from any earnings the inmate accrues
from work performed in the facility or while on conditional release. The chief executive officer
shall forward the amount collected to the court administrator or other entity collecting the surcharge
imposed by the court.
   (f) A person who successfully completes a diversion or similar program for a violation of chapter
169 must pay the surcharge described in this subdivision.
      (g) The surcharge does not apply to administrative citations issued pursuant to section 169.999.
      Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 357.021, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Disbursement of surcharges by commissioner of management and budget. (a)
Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), the commissioner of management and budget shall
disburse surcharges received under subdivision 6 and section 97A.065, subdivision 2, as follows:
    (1) one percent shall be credited to the game and fish fund to provide peace officer training
for employees of the Department of Natural Resources who are licensed under sections 626.84 to
626.863, and who possess peace officer authority for the purpose of enforcing game and fish laws;
      (2) 39 percent shall be credited to the peace officers training account in the special revenue fund;
and
      (3) 60 percent shall be credited to the general fund.
   (b) The commissioner of management and budget shall credit $3 of each surcharge received
under subdivision 6 and section 97A.065, subdivision 2, to the general fund.
   (c) In addition to any amounts credited under paragraph (a), the commissioner of management
and budget shall credit ­
                        $4­7
                           ­ $54 of each surcharge received under subdivision 6 and section 97A.065,
subdivision 2, and the $12 parking surcharge, to the general fund.

    (d) If the Ramsey County Board of Commissioners authorizes imposition of the additional
$1 surcharge provided for in subdivision 6, paragraph (a), the court administrator in the Second
Judicial District shall transmit the surcharge to the commissioner of management and budget. The
$1 special surcharge is deposited in a Ramsey County surcharge account in the special revenue
fund and amounts in the account are appropriated to the trial courts for the administration of the
petty misdemeanor diversion program operated by the Second Judicial District Ramsey County
Violations Bureau."

determined by the commissioner must be computed in accordance with tables prepared and issued

commissioner may disregard a fractional part of a dollar unless it amounts to 50 cents or more, in
which case it may be increased to $1.

in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code and increased by the additions required under section
290.01, subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (12), (13), (16), and (17), and reduced
by the Minnesota assignable portion of the subtraction for United States government interest under
section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clause (1), and the subtractions under section 290.01, subdivision
19b, clauses (8), (9), (13), (14), (15), and (17), after applying the allocation and assignability
provisions of section 290.081, clause (a), or 290.17; and
   (2) the denominator is the individual's federal adjusted gross income as defined in section
62 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, increased by the amounts specified in section 290.01,

rate brackets provided in subdivision 2c shall be the rate brackets as they existed for taxable years
beginning after December 31, ­   19

any rate bracket must not be changed. The dollar amounts setting forth the tax shall be adjusted to
reflect the changes in the rate brackets. The rate brackets as adjusted must be rounded to the nearest
$10 amount. If the rate bracket ends in $5, it must be rounded up to the nearest $10 amount.

to the provisions of section 1(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, except that in section 1(f)(3)(B) the
