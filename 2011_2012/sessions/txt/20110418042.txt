as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), during the probationary period any annual contract with
any teacher may or may not be renewed as the school board shall see fit. However, the board must

teaching contract, the board must give the teacher its reason in writing, including a statement that
appropriate supervision was furnished describing the nature and the extent of such supervision
furnished the teacher during the employment by the board, within ten days after receiving such
request. The school board may, after a hearing held upon due notice, discharge a teacher during the
probationary period for cause, effective immediately, under section 122A.44.
    (b) A board must discharge a probationary teacher, effective immediately, upon receipt of notice

reemployment timelines for uniformed service personnel under United States Code, title 38, section

   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.40, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 8a. Probationary period for principals hired internally. A probationary period of
two school years is required for a licensed teacher employed by the board who is subsequently
employed by the board as a licensed school principal or assistant principal and an additional
probationary period of two years is required for a licensed assistant principal employed by the
board who is subsequently employed by the board as a licensed principal. A licensed teacher
subsequently employed by the board as a licensed school principal or assistant principal retains the
teacher's continuing contract status as a licensed teacher during the probationary period under this
subdivision and has the right to return to his or her previous position or an equivalent position, if
available, if the teacher is not promoted.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective June 30, 2011, and applies to all contracts for
internally hired licensed school principals and assistant principals ratified or modified after that date.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.40, subdivision 11, is amended to read:
    Subd. 11. Unrequested leave of absence. (a) The board may place on unrequested leave
of absence, without pay or fringe benefits, as many teachers as may be necessary because of
discontinuance of position, lack of pupils, financial limitations, or merger of classes caused by
consolidation of districts. The unrequested leave is effective at the close of the school year. In
placing teachers on unrequested leave, the board may exempt from the effects of paragraphs (b) to

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
     Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.41, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
     Subd. 10. Decision, when rendered. The hearing must be concluded and a decision in writing,
stating the grounds on which it is based, rendered within 25 days after giving of such notice. Where
the hearing is before a school board the teacher may be discharged or demoted upon the affirmative
vote of a majority of the members of the board. If the charges, or any of such, are found to be true,
the board conducting the hearing must discharge, demote, or suspend the teacher, as seems to be for
the best interest of the school. A         ­­­­e

development resources and plans. The model must be designed to improve teaching and learning
by supporting administrators in shaping the school's professional environment and developing
teacher quality, performance, and effectiveness. The model must, at a minimum:

supervision and in teacher evaluation and development;
    (2) provide professional development that emphasizes improved teaching and learning,
curriculum and instruction, student learning, and a collaborative professional culture;
    (3) make appropriate recommendations for administrators to participate in development
opportunities, including the Principals' Leadership Institute under section 122A.74 and other
statewide development programs that support administrators' leadership behaviors and practices,
rigorous curriculum, school performance, and high quality instruction; and

data on student academic growth as evaluation components; and provide professional development
opportunities targeted at identifying systemic strengths and weaknesses and administrators'
