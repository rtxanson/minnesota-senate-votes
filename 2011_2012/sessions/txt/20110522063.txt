                   CONFERENCE COMMITTEE REPORT ON H. F. NO. 954

appointive in Kittson County.

The Honorable Kurt Zellers
Speaker of the House of Representatives
The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
    We, the undersigned conferees for H. F. No. 954 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
   That the Senate recede from its amendment and that H. F. No. 954 be further amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. KITTSON, MARSHALL COUNTY OFFICES MAY BE APPOINTED.
    Subdivision 1. Authority to make office appointive. Notwithstanding Minnesota Statutes,
section 382.01, upon adoption of a resolution by the Kittson County Board of Commissioners or
the Marshall County Board of Commissioners, the respective offices of county recorder and county
auditor-treasurer in that county are not elective but must be filled by appointment by the county
board as provided in the resolution.
    Subd. 2. Board controls; may change as long as duties done. Upon adoption of a resolution
by the county board of commissioners and subject to subdivisions 3 and 4, the duties of an elected
official required by statute whose office is made appointive as authorized by this section must be
discharged by the county board of commissioners acting through a department head appointed by
the board for that purpose. Reorganization, reallocation, delegation, or other administrative change
or transfer does not diminish, prohibit, or avoid the discharge of duties required by statute.
    Subd. 3. Incumbents to complete term. The person elected at the last general election to
an office made appointive under this section must serve in that capacity and perform the duties,
functions, and responsibilities required by statute until the completion of the term of office to which
the person was elected or until a vacancy occurs in the office, whichever occurs earlier.
    Subd. 4. Publishing resolution; petition, referendum. (a) Before the adoption of the resolution
to provide for the appointment of the county recorder and county auditor-treasurer, the county board
must publish a proposed resolution notifying the public of its intent to consider the issue once each
week for two consecutive weeks in the official publication of the county. Following publication and
prior to formally adopting the resolution, the county board shall provide an opportunity at its next
regular meeting for public comment relating to the issue. After the public comment opportunity,
at the same meeting or a subsequent meeting, the county board of commissioners may adopt a
resolution that provides for the appointment of the county recorder and county auditor-treasurer as
permitted in this section. The resolution must be approved by at least 80 percent of the members of
the county board. The resolution may take effect 60 days after it is adopted, or at a later date stated
in the resolution, unless a petition is filed as provided in paragraph (b).
63RD DAY]                             SUNDAY, MAY 22, 2011                                         3267

    (b) Within 60 days after the county board adopts the resolution, a petition requesting a
referendum may be filed with the county auditor-treasurer. The petition must be signed by at least
ten percent of the registered voters of the county. The petition must meet the requirements of the
secretary of state, as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 204B.071, and any rules adopted to
implement that section. If the petition is sufficient, the question of appointing the county recorder
and county auditor-treasurer must be placed on the ballot at a regular or special election. If a
majority of the voters of the county voting on the question vote in favor of appointment, the
resolution may be implemented.
    Subd. 5. Reverting to elected offices. (a) The county board may adopt a resolution to provide
for the election of an office made an appointed position under this section, but not until at least three
years after the office was made an appointed position. The county board must publish a proposed
resolution notifying the public of its intent to consider the issue once each week for two consecutive
weeks in the official publication of the county. Following publication and before formally adopting
the resolution, the county board must provide an opportunity at its next regular meeting for public
comment relating to the issue. After the public comment hearing, the county board may adopt the
resolution. The resolution must be approved by at least 60 percent of the members of the county
board and is effective August 1 following adoption of the resolution.
    (b) The question of whether an office made an appointed position under this section must be
made an elected office must be placed on the ballot at the next general election if (1) the position
has been an appointed position for at least three years, (2) a petition signed by at least ten percent of
the registered voters of the county is filed with the office of the county auditor-treasurer by August
1 of the year in which the general election is held, and (3) the petition meets the requirements of
the secretary of state, as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 204B.071, and any rules adopted
to implement that section. If a majority of the voters of the county voting on the question vote in
favor of making the office an elected position, the election for that office must be held at the next
regular or special election.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective as to Marshall County the day after the Marshall
County Board of Commissioners and its chief clerical officer timely complete their compliance with
Minnesota Statutes, section 645.021, subdivisions 2 and 3. This section is effective as to Kittson
County the day after the Kittson County Board of Commissioners and its chief clerical officer timely
complete their compliance with Minnesota Statutes, section 645.021, subdivisions 2 and 3."
   Delete the title and insert:
   "A bill for an act relating to counties; providing a process for making certain county offices
appointive in the counties of Kittson and Marshall."
   We request the adoption of this report and repassage of the bill.
