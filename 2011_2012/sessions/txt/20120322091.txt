without adoption assistance. If the identified parent is either unwilling or unable to adopt the child
without adoption assistance, the child-placing agency must provide documentation as prescribed by

    (b) Reimbursements under this paragraph shall be made only after the adoptive parent
documents that the requested service was denied by the local social service agency, community
agencies, local school district, local public health department, the parent's insurance provider, or
the child's program. The denial must be for an eligible service or qualified item under the program
requirements of the applicable agency or organization.
   (c) Reimbursements must be previously authorized, adhere to the requirements and procedures
prescribed by the commissioner, and be limited to:
    (1) child care for a child age 12 and younger, or for a child age 13 or 14 who has a documented
disability that requires special instruction for and services by the child care provider. Child care
reimbursements may be made if all available adult caregivers are employed or attending educational
or vocational training programs. If a parent is attending an educational or vocational training
program, child care reimbursement is limited to no more than the time necessary to complete the

Reimbursement is limited to 12 sessions of postadoption counseling;
    (5) family counseling that is required to meet the child's special needs. Reimbursement is limited

insurance or Medicaid pays for the child's counseling but does not cover counseling for the rest of
the family members;
   (6) home modifications to accommodate the child's special needs upon which eligibility for
adoption assistance was approved. Reimbursement is limited to once every five years per child;
    (7) vehicle modifications to accommodate the child's special needs upon which eligibility for

PAYMENT.
    Subdivision 1. Negotiation of adoption assistance agreement. (a) A monthly payment
is provided as part of the adoption assistance agreement to support the care of a child who
has manifested special needs. The amount of the payment made on behalf of a child eligible
for adoption assistance is determined through negotiation between the adoptive parent and the
child-placing agency on behalf of the commissioner. The negotiation shall take into consideration
the circumstances of the adopting parent and the needs of the child being adopted. The income of
the adoptive parent must not be taken into consideration when determining eligibility for adoption
assistance or the amount of the payments under section 259A.20. At the written request of the
adoptive parent, the amount of the payment in the agreement may be renegotiated when there is a
change in the child's needs or the family's circumstances.
    (b) The adoption assistance agreement of a child who is identified as an at-risk child must not
include a monthly payment unless and until the potential disability upon which the eligibility for
the agreement was based has manifested during childhood.
    Subd. 2. Renegotiation of adoption assistance agreement. (a) An adoptive parent of a child
with an adoption assistance agreement may request renegotiation of the agreement when there
is a change in the needs of the child or in the family's circumstances. When an adoptive parent
requests renegotiation of the agreement, a reassessment of the child must be completed by: (1) the
responsible social services agency in the child's county of residence; or (2) the child-placing agency
that facilitated the adoption when the child's residence is out of state. If the reassessment indicates
that the child's needs have changed, the child-placing agency, on behalf of the commissioner and
4698                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [91ST DAY

the parent, shall renegotiate the agreement to include a payment of the level determined appropriate
through the reassessment process using the assessment tool prescribed by the commissioner
according to section 259A.15, subdivision 3. The agreement must not be renegotiated unless the
commissioner and the parent mutually agree to the changes. The effective date of any renegotiated
agreement must be determined according to requirements and procedures prescribed by the
commissioner.
    (b) An adoptive parent of a child with an adoption assistance agreement based on the child being
an at-risk child may request renegotiation of the agreement to include a monthly payment. The parent
must have written documentation from a qualified expert that the potential disability upon which
eligibility for adoption assistance was approved has manifested. Documentation of the disability
must be limited to evidence deemed appropriate by the commissioner. Prior to renegotiating the
agreement, a reassessment of the child must be conducted using an assessment tool prescribed by
the commissioner according to section 259A.15, subdivision 3. The reassessment must be used to
renegotiate the agreement to include an appropriate monthly payment. The agreement must not be
renegotiated unless the commissioner and the adoptive parent mutually agree to the changes. The
effective date of any renegotiated agreement must be determined according to requirements and
procedures prescribed by the commissioner.
    Subd. 3. Child income or income attributable to the child. No income received by a child will
be considered in determining a child's adoption assistance payment amount. If a child for whom a
parent is receiving adoption assistance is also receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or
Retirement, Survivors, Disability Insurance (RSDI), the certifying agency shall inform the adoptive
parent that the child's adoption assistance must be reported to the Social Security Administration.
   Sec. 7. [259A.30] REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES.
    Subdivision 1. Notification of change. (a) An adoptive parent who has an adoption assistance
agreement shall keep the agency administering the program informed of changes in status or
circumstances that would make the child ineligible for the payments or eligible for payments in a
different amount.
   (b) As long as the agreement is in effect, the adoptive parent agrees to notify the agency
administering the program in writing within 30 days of the following changes:
   (1) the child's or adoptive parent's legal name;
   (2) the family's address;

or 3, was based.
    Subd. 2. Correct and true information. If the adoptive parent reports information the adoptive
parent knows is untrue, the adoptive parent fails to notify the commissioner of changes that may
affect eligibility, or the agency administering the program receives information the adoptive parent
did not report, the adoptive parent may be investigated for theft and, if charged and convicted, shall
be sentenced under section 609.52, subdivision 3, clauses (1) to (5).
   Sec. 8. [259A.35] TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT.
    Subdivision 1. Reasons for termination. (a) An adoption assistance agreement shall terminate
in any of the following circumstances:
    (1) the child has attained the age of 18, or up to age 21, when the child meets a condition for
extension as outlined in section 259A.45, subdivision 1;

is no longer legally responsible for support of the child;
    (3) the commissioner determines the adoptive parent is no longer providing financial support to
the child up to age 21;
   (4) the death of the child; or
   (5) the adoptive parent requests in writing termination of the adoption assistance agreement.
    (b) An adoptive parent is considered no longer legally responsible for support of the child in any

    Subd. 2. Death of adoptive parent or adoption dissolution. The adoption assistance agreement
ends upon death or termination of parental rights of both adoptive parents in the case of a two-parent
adoption, or the sole adoptive parent in the case of a single-parent adoption. The child's adoption
assistance eligibility may be continued according to section 259A.40.
   Subd. 3. Termination notice for parent. The commissioner shall provide the child's parent
written notice of termination of payment. Termination notices must be sent according to the
requirements and procedures prescribed by the commissioner.
   Sec. 9. [259A.40] ASSIGNMENT OF ADOPTION ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT.
   Subdivision 1. Continuing child's eligibility for title IV-E adoption assistance in a
subsequent adoption. (a) The child maintains eligibility for title IV-E adoption assistance in a
subsequent adoption if the following criteria are met:
   (1) the child is determined to be a child with special needs as outlined in section 259A.10,
subdivision 2; and
   (2) the subsequent adoptive parent resides in Minnesota.
    (b) If the child had a title IV-E adoption assistance agreement prior to the death of the adoptive
parent or dissolution of the adoption, and the subsequent adoptive parent resides outside of
Minnesota, the state is not responsible for determining whether the child meets the definition of
special needs, entering into the adoption assistance agreement, and making any adoption assistance
payments outlined in the new agreement unless a state agency in Minnesota has responsibility for
placement and care of the child at the time of the subsequent adoption. If there is no state agency in
Minnesota that has responsibility for placement and care of the child at the time of the subsequent
adoption, it is the public child welfare agency in the subsequent adoptive parent's residence that is
responsible for determining whether the child meets the definition of special needs and entering
into the adoption assistance agreement.
    Subd. 2. Assigning a child's adoption assistance to a court-appointed guardian. (a)
State-funded adoption assistance may be continued with the written consent of the commissioner
to an individual who is a guardian appointed by a court for the child upon the death of both the
adoptive parents in the case of a two-parent adoption, or the sole adoptive parent in the case of a
single-parent adoption, unless the child is under the custody of a child-placing agency.
    (b) Temporary assignment of adoption assistance may be approved by the commissioner for a
maximum of six consecutive months from the death of the parent or parents and must adhere to the
requirements and procedures prescribed by the commissioner. If, within six months, the child has
not been adopted by a person agreed upon by the commissioner, or if a court has not appointed a
legal guardian under either section 260C.325 or 524.5-313, or similar law of another jurisdiction,
the adoption assistance shall terminate. Upon assignment of payments pursuant to this subdivision,
funding shall be from state funds only.
   Sec. 10. [259A.45] EXTENSION OF ADOPTION ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT.
    Subdivision 1. General requirements. (a) Under certain limited circumstances a child may
qualify for extension of the adoption assistance agreement beyond the date the child attains age 18,

for reasons including, but not limited to: when eligibility for adoption assistance is denied,
when a specific payment or reimbursement is modified or denied, and when the agreement for
an eligible child is terminated. A prospective adoptive parent who disagrees with a decision by
the commissioner prior to finalization of the adoption may request review of the decision by the
commissioner, or may appeal the decision under section 256.045.
    Subd. 2. Extenuating circumstances. (a) An adoption assistance agreement must be signed and
fully executed prior to the court order that finalizes the adoption. An adoptive parent who believes

prove the existence of extenuating circumstances, such as:
    (1) relevant facts regarding the child were known by the child-placing agency and not presented
to the parent prior to finalization of the adoption; or

assistance for a child in the county-paid foster care system.
    (b) If an appeals judge finds through the fair hearing process that extenuating circumstances
existed and that the child met all eligibility criteria at the time the adoption was finalized, the
effective date and any associated federal financial participation shall be retroactive to the date of
the request for a fair hearing.

       Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 260.012, is amended to read:
  260.012 DUTY TO ENSURE PLACEMENT                                PREVENTION          AND     FAMILY
REUNIFICATION; REASONABLE EFFORTS.
    (a) Once a child alleged to be in need of protection or services is under the court's jurisdiction,
the court shall ensure that reasonable efforts, including culturally appropriate services, by the social
services agency are made to prevent placement or to eliminate the need for removal and to reunite
the child with the child's family at the earliest possible time, and the court must ensure that the
responsible social services agency makes reasonable efforts to finalize an alternative permanent
plan for the child as provided in paragraph (e). In determining reasonable efforts to be made with
respect to a child and in making those reasonable efforts, the child's best interests, health, and safety
must be of paramount concern. Reasonable efforts to prevent placement and for rehabilitation and
reunification are always required except upon a determination by the court that a petition has been
filed stating a prima facie case that:
       (1) the parent has subjected a child to egregious harm as defined in section 260C.007, subdivision
14;
       (2) the parental rights of the parent to another child have been terminated involuntarily;
       (3) the child is an abandoned infant under section 260C.301, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause
(2);
    (4) the parent's custodial rights to another child have been involuntarily transferred to a relative
under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, paragraph (d), clause (1), or a similar law of another
jurisdiction; o
              ­­r
    (5) the parent has committed sexual abuse as defined in section 626.556, subdivision 2, against
the child or another child of the parent;
    (6) the parent has committed an offense that requires registration as a predatory offender under
section 243.166, subdivision 1b, paragraph (a) or (b); or

91ST DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 22, 2012                                       4707

    (c) In the case of an Indian child, in proceedings under sections 260B.178 or 260C.178,
260C.201, and 260C.301 the juvenile court must make findings and conclusions consistent with
the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, United States Code, title 25, section 1901 et seq., as to the
provision of active efforts. In cases governed by the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, United
States Code, title 25, section 1901, the responsible social services agency must provide active
efforts as required under United States Code, title 25, section 1911(d).
   (d) "Reasonable efforts to prevent placement" means:
   (1) the agency has made reasonable efforts to prevent the placement of the child in foster care
by working with the family to develop and implement a safety plan; or
    (2) given the particular circumstances of the child and family at the time of the child's removal,
there are no services or efforts available which could allow the child to safely remain in the home.
    (e) "Reasonable efforts to finalize a permanent plan for the child" means due diligence by the
responsible social services agency to:
   (1) reunify the child with the parent or guardian from whom the child was removed;
    (2) assess a noncustodial parent's ability to provide day-to-day care for the child and, where
appropriate, provide services necessary to enable the noncustodial parent to safely provide the care,
as required by section 260C.212, subdivision 4;
    (3) conduct a relative search to identify and provide notice to adult relatives as required under
section 260C.212, subdivision 5;
    (4) place siblings removed from their home in the same home for foster care or adoption, or
transfer permanent legal and physical custody to a relative. Visitation between siblings who are not
in the same foster care, adoption, or custodial placement or facility shall be consistent with section
260C.212, subdivision 2; and
    (5) when the child cannot return to the parent or guardian from whom the child was removed,
to plan for and finalize a safe and legally permanent alternative home for the child, and considers
permanent alternative homes for the child inside or outside of the state, preferably through adoption
or transfer of permanent legal and physical custody of the child.
    (f) Reasonable efforts are made upon the exercise of due diligence by the responsible social
services agency to use culturally appropriate and available services to meet the needs of the child and
the child's family. Services may include those provided by the responsible social services agency and
other culturally appropriate services available in the community. At each stage of the proceedings
where the court is required to review the appropriateness of the responsible social services agency's
reasonable efforts as described in paragraphs (a), (d), and (e), the social services agency has the
burden of demonstrating that:
   (1) it has made reasonable efforts to prevent placement of the child in foster care;
   (2) it has made reasonable efforts to eliminate the need for removal of the child from the child's
home and to reunify the child with the child's family at the earliest possible time;
   (3) it has made reasonable efforts to finalize an alternative permanent home for the child, and
considers permanent alternative homes for the child inside or outside of the state; or

    (4) reasonable efforts to prevent placement and to reunify the child with the parent or guardian
are not required. The agency may meet this burden by stating facts in a sworn petition filed under
section 260C.141, by filing an affidavit summarizing the agency's reasonable efforts or facts the
agency believes demonstrate there is no need for reasonable efforts to reunify the parent and child,
or through testimony or a certified report required under juvenile court rules.
    (g) Once the court determines that reasonable efforts for reunification are not required because
the court has made one of the prima facie determinations under paragraph (a), the court may only
require reasonable efforts for reunification after a hearing according to section 260C.163, where the
court finds there is not clear and convincing evidence of the facts upon which the court based its
prima facie determination. In this case when there is clear and convincing evidence that the child
is in need of protection or services, the court may find the child in need of protection or services
and order any of the dispositions available under section 260C.201, subdivision 1. Reunification of

   (4) committing sexual abuse as defined in section 626.556, subdivision 2, against the child or
another child of the parent; or
   (5) an offense that requires registration as a predatory offender under section 243.166,
subdivision 1b, paragraph (a) or (b).
    (h) The juvenile court, in proceedings under sections 260B.178 or 260C.178, 260C.201, and
260C.301 shall make findings and conclusions as to the provision of reasonable efforts. When
determining whether reasonable efforts have been made, the court shall consider whether services
to the child and family were:
   (1) relevant to the safety and protection of the child;
   (2) adequate to meet the needs of the child and family;
   (3) culturally appropriate;
   (4) available and accessible;
   (5) consistent and timely; and
   (6) realistic under the circumstances.
    In the alternative, the court may determine that provision of services or further services for
the purpose of rehabilitation is futile and therefore unreasonable under the circumstances or that
reasonable efforts are not required as provided in paragraph (a).
    (i) This section does not prevent out-of-home placement for treatment of a child with a mental
disability when it is determined to be medically necessary as a result of the child's diagnostic

assessment or individual treatment plan indicates that appropriate and necessary treatment cannot
be effectively provided outside of a residential or inpatient treatment program and the level or
intensity of supervision and treatment cannot be effectively and safely provided in the child's home
or community and it is determined that a residential treatment setting is the least restrictive setting
that is appropriate to the needs of the child.
    (j) If continuation of reasonable efforts to prevent placement or reunify the child with the parent
or guardian from whom the child was removed is determined by the court to be inconsistent with
the permanent plan for the child or upon the court making one of the prima facie determinations
under paragraph (a), reasonable efforts must be made to place the child in a timely manner in a safe
and permanent home and to complete whatever steps are necessary to legally finalize the permanent
placement of the child.
    (k) Reasonable efforts to place a child for adoption or in another permanent placement may
be made concurrently with reasonable efforts to prevent placement or to reunify the child with the
parent or guardian from whom the child was removed. When the responsible social services agency
decides to concurrently make reasonable efforts for both reunification and permanent placement
away from the parent under paragraph (a), the agency shall disclose its decision and both plans for
concurrent reasonable efforts to all parties and the court. When the agency discloses its decision to
proceed on both plans for reunification and permanent placement away from the parent, the court's
review of the agency's reasonable efforts shall include the agency's efforts under both plans.

    (i) unless reunification is not required under section 260.012, developing a permanency plan
for the child that includes a primary plan for reunification with the child's parent or guardian and
a secondary plan for an alternative, legally permanent home for the child in the event reunification
cannot be achieved in a timely manner;
   (ii) identifying, locating, and assessing both parents of the child as soon as possible and offering
reunification services to both parents of the child as required under section 260.012 and 260C.219;
   (iii) identifying, locating, and notifying relatives of both parents of the child according to section
260.221;
    (iv) making a placement with a family that will commit to being the legally permanent home for
the child in the event reunification cannot occur at the earliest possible time while at the same time
actively supporting the reunification plan; and
    (v) returning the child home with supports and services, as soon as return is safe for the child,
or when safe return cannot be timely achieved, moving to finalize another legally permanent home

   (1) when required and appropriate, reasonable efforts have been made by the social services
agency to reunite the child with the child's parents in a home that is safe and permanent; and
    (2) if placement with the parents is not reasonably foreseeable, to secure for the child a safe and
permanent placement according to the requirements of section 260C.212, subdivision 2, preferably
with adoptive parents or, if that is not possible or in the best interests of the child, a fit and willing
relative through transfer of permanent legal and physical custody to that relative; and
    (3) when a child is under the guardianship of the commissioner of human services, reasonable
efforts are made to finalize an adoptive home for the child in a timely manner.
    Nothing in this section requires reasonable efforts to prevent placement or to reunify the child
with the parent or guardian to be made in circumstances where the court has determined that the

Minnesota Rules of Juvenile Protection Procedure.
    (d) The court may order genetic testing of any putative father or any man presumed to be father
of a child who is the subject of a juvenile protection matter unless paternity of the child has already
been adjudicated under the Minnesota Parentage Act or if a recognition of parentage has been fully
executed and filed under section 257.75 when the recognition of parentage has the force and effect
of a judgment or order determining the existence of the parent and child relationship under section
257.66. If genetic testing is ordered, a positive genetic test under section 257.62, subdivision 5, is
required to establish paternity for a child under this chapter.
   (e) A copy of the order establishing the parent and child relationship shall be filed in family court.
Any further proceedings for modification of the child support portion of the order that establishes the
parent and child relationship shall be brought in the family court of the county where the original
order was filed. The review shall be under chapters 518 and 518A. Notice of any family court
proceedings shall be provided by the court administrator to the responsible social services agency,
which shall be a party to the family court proceeding.
     Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 260C.157, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Investigation. Upon request of the court the responsible social services agency

coming within the jurisdiction of the court under section 260C.101 and shall report its findings to
the court. The court may order any minor coming within its jurisdiction to be examined by a duly
qualified physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist appointed by the court.
     Adoption investigations shall be conducted in accordance with the laws relating to adoptions

any other federally recognized Indian tribe, as defined in section 260.755, subdivision 12.
    (c) If the court, prior to, or as part of, a final disposition, proposes to place a child:
    (1) for the primary purpose of treatment for an emotional disturbance, a developmental disability,
or chemical dependency in a residential treatment facility out of state or in one which is within the
state and licensed by the commissioner of human services under chapter 245A; or
    (2) in any out-of-home setting potentially exceeding 30 days in duration, including a
postdispositional placement in a facility licensed by the commissioner of corrections or human
services, the court shall ascertain whether the child is an Indian child and shall notify the county
welfare agency and, if the child is an Indian child, shall notify the Indian child's tribe. The
county's juvenile treatment screening team must either: (i) screen and evaluate the child and file its
recommendations with the court within 14 days of receipt of the notice; or (ii) elect not to screen a
given case and notify the court of that decision within three working days.

    (2) the screening team has evaluated the child and recommended that a residential placement
is necessary to meet the child's treatment needs and the safety needs of the community, that it is a
cost-effective means of meeting the treatment needs, and that it will be of therapeutic value to the
child; or
    (3) the court, having reviewed a screening team recommendation against placement, determines
to the contrary that a residential placement is necessary. The court shall state the reasons for
its determination in writing, on the record, and shall respond specifically to the findings and
recommendation of the screening team in explaining why the recommendation was rejected. The
attorney representing the child and the prosecuting attorney shall be afforded an opportunity to be
heard on the matter.
    (e) When the county's juvenile treatment screening team has elected to screen and evaluate a
child determined to be an Indian child, the team shall provide notice to the tribe or tribes that
accept jurisdiction for the Indian child or that recognize the child as a member of the tribe or as
a person eligible for membership in the tribe, and permit the tribe's representative to participate in
the screening team.
    (f) When the Indian child's tribe or tribal health care services provider or Indian Health Services
provider proposes to place a child for the primary purpose of treatment for an emotional disturbance,
a developmental disability, or co-occurring emotional disturbance and chemical dependency, the
Indian child's tribe or the tribe delegated by the child's tribe shall submit necessary documentation to
the county juvenile treatment screening team, which must invite the Indian child's tribe to designate
a representative to the screening team.

file the decision with the court administrator as soon as possible but no later than 15 days after the

county attorney shall also have the responsibility for advancing the public interest in the welfare of
the child.
    Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 260C.178, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Hearing and release requirements. (a) If a child was taken into custody under
section 260C.175, subdivision 1, clause (1) or (2), item (ii), the court shall hold a hearing within 72
hours of the time the child was taken into custody, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, to
determine whether the child should continue in custody.
    (b) Unless there is reason to believe that the child would endanger self or others or not return

for a court hearing, or that the child's health or welfare would be immediately endangered, the child
shall be released to the custody of a parent, guardian, custodian, or other suitable person, subject to
reasonable conditions of release including, but not limited to, a requirement that the child undergo
a chemical use assessment as provided in section 260C.157, subdivision 1.
    (c) If the court determines there is reason to believe that the child would endanger self or
others or not return for a court hearing, or that the child's health or welfare would be immediately
endangered if returned to the care of the parent or guardian who has custody and from whom the
child was removed, the court shall order the child into foster care under the legal responsibility
of the responsible social services agency or responsible probation or corrections agency for the
purposes of protective care as that term is used in the juvenile court rules or into the home of a
noncustodial parent and order the noncustodial parent to comply with any conditions the court
determines to be appropriate to the safety and care of the child, including cooperating with paternity
establishment proceedings in the case of a man who has not been adjudicated the child's father. The
court shall not give the responsible social services legal custody and order a trial home visit at any
time prior to adjudication and disposition under section 260C.201, subdivision 1, paragraph (a),
clause (3), but may order the child returned to the care of the parent or guardian who has custody
and from whom the child was removed and order the parent or guardian to comply with any
conditions the court determines to be appropriate to meet the safety, health, and welfare of the child.
   (d) In determining whether the child's health or welfare would be immediately endangered, the
court shall consider whether the child would reside with a perpetrator of domestic child abuse.
    (e) The court, before determining whether a child should be placed in or continue in foster care
under the protective care of the responsible agency, shall also make a determination, consistent
with section 260.012 as to whether reasonable efforts were made to prevent placement or whether
reasonable efforts to prevent placement are not required. In the case of an Indian child, the court shall
determine whether active efforts, according to the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, United States
Code, title 25, section 1912(d), were made to prevent placement. The court shall enter a finding that
the responsible social services agency has made reasonable efforts to prevent placement when the
agency establishes either:
   (1) that it has actually provided services or made efforts in an attempt to prevent the child's
removal but that such services or efforts have not proven sufficient to permit the child to safely
remain in the home; or
    (2) that there are no services or other efforts that could be made at the time of the hearing that
could safely permit the child to remain home or to return home. When reasonable efforts to prevent
placement are required and there are services or other efforts that could be ordered which would
permit the child to safely return home, the court shall order the child returned to the care of the
parent or guardian and the services or efforts put in place to ensure the child's safety. When the
court makes a prima facie determination that one of the circumstances under paragraph (g) exists,
the court shall determine that reasonable efforts to prevent placement and to return the child to the
care of the parent or guardian are not required.
    If the court finds the social services agency's preventive or reunification efforts have not been
reasonable but further preventive or reunification efforts could not permit the child to safely remain
at home, the court may nevertheless authorize or continue the removal of the child.
   (f) The court may not order or continue the foster care placement of the child unless the court

makes explicit, individualized findings that continued custody of the child by the parent or guardian
would be contrary to the welfare of the child and that placement is in the best interest of the child.
    (g) At the emergency removal hearing, or at any time during the course of the proceeding, and
upon notice and request of the county attorney, the court shall determine whether a petition has been
filed stating a prima facie case that:
       (1) the parent has subjected a child to egregious harm as defined in section 260C.007, subdivision
14;
       (2) the parental rights of the parent to another child have been involuntarily terminated;
       (3) the child is an abandoned infant under section 260C.301, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause
(2);
   (4) the parents' custodial rights to another child have been involuntarily transferred to a relative
under Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 260C.201, subdivision 11, paragraph (e), clause (1); section
260C.515, subdivision 4, or a similar law of another jurisdiction; o­­
                                                                     r
    (5) the parent has committed sexual abuse as defined in section 626.556, subdivision 2, against
the child or another child of the parent;
    (6) the parent has committed an offense that requires registration as a predatory offender under
section 243.166, subdivision 1b, paragraph (a) or (b); or
    (7) the provision of services or further services for the purpose of reunification is futile and
therefore unreasonable.
    (h) When a petition to terminate parental rights is required under section 260C.301, subdivision
3 or 4, but the county attorney has determined not to proceed with a termination of parental rights
petition, and has instead filed a petition to transfer permanent legal and physical custody to a

attorney determines that the criminal case shall proceed to trial first under section 2   ­6

    (j) If the court determines the child should be ordered into foster care and the child's parent
refuses to give information to the responsible social services agency regarding the child's father
or relatives of the child, the court may order the parent to disclose the names, addresses, telephone
numbers, and other identifying information to the responsible social services agency for the purpose
of complying with ­h t­­

    (k) If a child ordered into foster care has siblings, whether full, half, or step, who are also ordered
into foster care, the court shall inquire of the responsible social services agency of the efforts to place
the children together as required by section 260C.212, subdivision 2, paragraph (d), if placement
together is in each child's best interests, unless a child is in placement for treatment or a child is
placed with a previously noncustodial parent who is not a parent to all siblings. If the children are
not placed together at the time of the hearing, the court shall inquire at each subsequent hearing of
4718                                      JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                               [91ST DAY

the agency's reasonable efforts to place the siblings together, as required under section 260.012. If
any sibling is not placed with another sibling or siblings, the agency must develop a plan to facilitate
visitation or ongoing contact among the siblings as required under section 260C.212, subdivision 1,
unless it is contrary to the safety or well-being of any of the siblings to do so.
    (l) When the court has ordered the child into foster care or into the home of a noncustodial
parent, the court may order a chemical dependency evaluation, mental health evaluation, medical
examination, and parenting assessment for the parent as necessary to support the development of
a plan for reunification required under subdivision 7 and section 260C.212, subdivision 1, or the
child protective services plan under section 626.556, subdivision 10, and Minnesota Rules, part
9560.0228.

    (b) Upon the filing of the out-of-home placement plan which has been developed jointly with
the parent and in consultation with others as required under section 260C.212, subdivision 1, the
court may approve implementation of the plan by the responsible social services agency based
on the allegations contained in the petition and any evaluations, examinations, or assessments
conducted under subdivision 1, paragraph (l). The court shall send written notice of the approval of
the out-of-home placement plan to all parties and the county attorney or may state such approval on
the record at a hearing. A parent may agree to comply with the terms of the plan filed with the court.

results of its efforts to engage the child's parents in the out-of-home placement plan filed with the
court. The agency shall notify the court of the services it will provide or efforts it will attempt under
the plan notwithstanding the parent's refusal to cooperate or disagreement with the services. The
parent may ask the court to modify the plan to require different or additional services requested by
the parent, but which the agency refused to provide. The court may approve the plan as presented by
the agency or may modify the plan to require services requested by the parent. The court's approval
shall be based on the content of the petition.
    (d) Unless the parent agrees to comply with the terms of the out-of-home placement plan, the
court may not order a parent to comply with the provisions of the plan until the court finds the child
is in need of protection or services and orders disposition under section 260C.201, subdivision 1.
However, the court may find that the responsible social services agency has made reasonable efforts
for reunification if the agency makes efforts to implement the terms of an out-of-home placement
plan approved under this section.

                       , The court may terminate jurisdiction on its own motion or the motion of any
interested party upon a determination that jurisdiction is no longer necessary to protect the child's
best interests except when:
     (1) a court order is necessary for a child to be in foster care; or
   (2) continued review under section 260C.203, 260C.515, subdivision 5 or 6, or 260C.317,
subdivision 3, is required for a child in foster care under section 260C.451.
    (c) Unless terminated by the court, and except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the
jurisdiction of the court shall continue until the child becomes 18 years of age. The court may
continue jurisdiction over an individual and all other parties to the proceeding to the individual's
19th birthday when continuing jurisdiction is in the individual's best interest in order to:
     (1) protect the safety or health of the individual;
     (2) accomplish additional planning for independent living or for the transition out of foster care;
or
     (3) support the individual's completion of high school or a high school equivalency program.

    Subd. 2. Written findings. (a) Any order for a disposition authorized under this section shall
contain written findings of fact to support the disposition and case plan ordered and shall also set
forth in writing the following information:
   (1) why the best interests and safety of the child are served by the disposition and case plan
ordered;
   (2) what alternative dispositions or services under the case plan were considered by the court
and why such dispositions or services were not appropriate in the instant case;
   (3) when legal custody of the child is transferred, the appropriateness of the particular placement
made or to be made by the placing agency using the factors in section 260C.212, subdivision 2,
paragraph (b);
   (4) whether reasonable efforts to finalize the permanent plan for the child consistent with section
260.012 were made including reasonable efforts:

                l child with the parent or guardian from whom the child was removed at the earliest
time consistent with the child's safety. The court's findings must include a brief description of what
preventive and reunification efforts were made and why further efforts could not have prevented
or eliminated the necessity of removal or that reasonable efforts were not required under section
260.012 or 260C.178, subdivision 1;
    (ii) to identify and locate any noncustodial or nonresident parent of the child and to assess such
parent's ability to provide day-to-day care of the child, and, where appropriate, provide services
necessary to enable the noncustodial or nonresident parent to safely provide day-to-day care of
the child as required under section 260C.219, unless such services are not required under section
260.012 or 260C.178, subdivision 1;
    (iii) to make the diligent search for relatives and provide the notices required under section
260C.221; a finding made pursuant to a hearing under section 260C.202 that the agency has made
diligent efforts to conduct a relative search and has appropriately engaged relatives who responded
to the notice under section 260C.221 and other relatives, who came to the attention of the agency
after notice under section 260C.221 was sent, in placement and case planning decisions fulfills the
requirement of this item;
    (iv) to identify and make a foster care placement in the home of an unlicensed relative,
according to the requirements of section 245A.035, a licensed relative, or other licensed foster
care provider who will commit to being the permanent legal parent or custodian for the child in the
event reunification cannot occur, but who will actively support the reunification plan for the child;
    (v) to place siblings together in the same home or to ensure visitation is occurring when siblings
are separated in foster care placement and visitation is in the siblings' best interests under section
260C.212, subdivision 2, paragraph (d); and
    (5) if the child has been adjudicated as a child in need of protection or services because the
child is in need of special services or care to treat or ameliorate a mental disability or emotional
disturbance as defined in section 245.4871, subdivision 15, the written findings shall also set forth:
    (i) whether the child has mental health needs that must be addressed by the case plan;
    (ii) what consideration was given to the diagnostic and functional assessments performed by
the child's mental health professional and to health and mental health care professionals' treatment
recommendations;
   (iii) what consideration was given to the requests or preferences of the child's parent or guardian
with regard to the child's interventions, services, or treatment; and
    (iv) what consideration was given to the cultural appropriateness of the child's treatment or
services.
    (b) If the court finds that the social services agency's preventive or reunification efforts have
not been reasonable but that further preventive or reunification efforts could not permit the child to
safely remain at home, the court may nevertheless authorize or continue the removal of the child.
    (c) If the child has been identified by the responsible social services agency as the subject
of concurrent permanency planning, the court shall review the reasonable efforts of the agency

required in juvenile court rules to determine whether continued out-of-home placement is necessary
and appropriate or whether the child should be returned home. This review is not required if the
court has returned the child home, ordered the child permanently placed away from the parent under

manner about who the child considers to be family members and important friends with whom the
child has resided or had significant contact. The relative search required under this section must
fulfill the agency's duties under the Indian Child Welfare Act regarding active efforts to prevent
the breakup of the Indian family under United States Code, title 25, section 1912(d) and to meet
placement preferences under United States Code, title 25, section 1915. The relatives must be
notified:
    (1) of the need for a foster home for the child, the option to become a placement resource for
the child, and the possibility of the need for a permanent placement for the child;
    (2) of their responsibility to keep the responsible social services agency informed of their current
address in order to receive notice in the event that a permanent placement is sought for the child. A
relative who fails to provide a current address to the responsible social services agency forfeits the
right to notice of the possibility of permanent placement. A decision by a relative not to be identified
as a potential permanent placement resource or participate in planning for the child at the beginning
of the case shall not affect whether the relative is considered for placement of the child with that
relative later;
    (3) that the relative may participate in the care and planning for the child, including that the
opportunity for such participation may be lost by failing to respond to the notice. "Participate in
the care and planning" includes, but is not limited to, participation in case planning for the parent
and child, identifying the strengths and needs of the parent and child, supervising visits, providing
respite and vacation visits for the child, providing transportation to appointments, suggesting other
relatives who might be able to help support the case plan, and to the extent possible, helping to
maintain the child's familiar and regular activities and contact with friends and relatives; ­

and how to request a variance from licensing standards that do not present a safety or health risk
to the child in the home under section 245A.04 and supports that are available for relatives and
children who reside in a family foster home.  ­; and
    (5) of the relatives' right to ask to be notified of any court proceedings regarding the child, to
attend the hearings, and of a relative's right or opportunity to be heard by the court as required under
section 260C.152, subdivision 5.

relatives including the Internet or other electronic means of conducting a search. The agency shall
disclose o ­n­­y
              l­ data that is necessary to facilitate possible placement with relatives and to ensure
that the relative is informed of the needs of the child so the relative can participate in planning
for the child and be supportive of services to the child and family. If the child's parent refuses
to give the responsible social services agency information sufficient to identify the maternal and
paternal relatives of the child, the agency shall ask the juvenile court to order the parent to provide

the necessary information. If a parent makes an explicit request that relatives or a specific relative
not be contacted or considered for placement, the agency shall bring the parent's request to the
attention of the court to determine whether the parent's request is consistent with the best interests
of the child and the agency shall not contact relatives or a specific relative unless authorized to do
so by the juvenile court.
    (c) At a regularly scheduled hearing not later than three months after the child's placement in
foster care and as required in section 260C.202, the agency shall report to the court:
    (1) its efforts to identify maternal and paternal relatives of the child, to engage the relatives in
providing support for the child and family, and document that the relatives have been provided the
notice required under paragraph (a); and
   (2) its decision regarding placing the child with a relative as required under section 260C.212,
subdivision 2, and to ask relatives to visit or maintain contact with the child in order to support
family connections for the child, when placement with a relative is not possible or appropriate.
    (d) Notwithstanding chapter 13, the agency shall disclose data about particular relatives
identified, searched for, and contacted for the purposes of the court's review of the agency's due
diligence.
    (e) When the court is satisfied that the agency has exercised due diligence to identify relatives
and provide the notice required in paragraph (a), the court may find that reasonable efforts have been
made to conduct a relative search to identify and provide notice to adult relatives as required under
section 260.012, paragraph (e), clause (3). If the court is not satisfied that the agency has exercised
due diligence to identify relatives and provide the notice required in paragraph (a), the court may
order the agency to continue its search and notice efforts and to report back to the court.

    Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 260C.212, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Administrative or court review of placements. (a) Unless the court is conducting the
reviews required under section 260C.202, there shall be an administrative review of the out-of-home
placement plan of each child placed in foster care no later than 180 days after the initial placement
of the child in foster care and at least every six months thereafter if the child is not returned to the
home of the parent or parents within that time. The out-of-home placement plan must be monitored
and updated at each administrative review. The administrative review shall be conducted by the
responsible social services agency using a panel of appropriate persons at least one of whom is not
responsible for the case management of, or the delivery of services to, either the child or the parents
who are the subject of the review. The administrative review shall be open to participation by the
parent or guardian of the child and the child, as appropriate.
    (b) As an alternative to the administrative review required in paragraph (a), the court may, as
part of any hearing required under the Minnesota Rules of Juvenile Protection Procedure, conduct
a hearing to monitor and update the out-of-home placement plan pursuant to the procedure and
standard in section 260C.201, subdivision 6, paragraph (d). The party requesting review of the
out-of-home placement plan shall give parties to the proceeding notice of the request to review and
update the out-of-home placement plan. A court review conducted pursuant to section 260C.141,

at age 18 or older, the responsible social services agency is required to develop a personalized
transition plan as directed by the youth. The transition plan must be developed during the 90-day
period immediately prior to the expected date of discharge. The transition plan must be as detailed
as the child may elect and include specific options on housing, health insurance, education, local
opportunities for mentors and continuing support services, and work force supports and employment
services. The plan must include information on the importance of designating another individual to
make health care treatment decisions on behalf of the child if the child becomes unable to participate
in these decisions and the child does not have, or does not want, a relative who would otherwise be
authorized to make these decisions. The plan must provide the child with the option to execute a
health care directive as provided under chapter 145C. The county shall also provide the individual
with appropriate contact information if the individual needs more information or needs help dealing
with a crisis situation through age 21.

260C.515, subdivision 5, terminates on the child's 18th birthday. The responsible social services
agency has legal responsibility for the individual's placement and care when the matter continues
under court jurisdiction pursuant to section 260C.193 or when the individual and the responsible
agency execute a voluntary placement agreement pursuant to section 260C.229.
    Subd. 8. Notice of termination of foster care. When a child in foster care between the ages
of 18 and 21 ceases to meet one of the eligibility criteria of subdivision 3a, the responsible social
services agency shall give the child written notice that foster care will terminate 30 days from the
date the notice is sent. The child or the child's guardian ad litem may file a motion asking the court
to review the agency's determination within 15 days of receiving the notice. The child shall not
be discharged from foster care until the motion is heard. The agency shall work with the child to
transition out of foster care as required under section 260C.203, paragraph (e). The written notice
of termination of benefits shall be on a form prescribed by the commissioner and shall also give
notice of the right to have the agency's determination reviewed by the court in the proceeding where
the court conducts the reviews required under sections 260C.203, 260C.515, subdivisions 5 or 6, or
260C.317. A copy of the termination notice shall be sent to the child and the child's attorney, if any,
the foster care provider, the child's guardian ad litem, and the court. The agency is not responsible
for paying foster care benefits for any period of time after the child actually leaves foster care.
      Sec. 27. [260C.503] PERMANENCY PROCEEDINGS.
    Subdivision 1. Required permanency proceedings. Except for children in foster care pursuant
to chapter 260D, where the child is in foster care or in the care of a noncustodial or nonresident
parent, the court shall commence proceedings to determine the permanent status of a child by holding
the admit-deny hearing required under section 260C.507 not later than 12 months after the child is
placed in foster care or in the care of a noncustodial or nonresident parent. Permanency proceedings
for children in foster care pursuant to chapter 260D shall be according to section 260D.07.
    Subd. 2. Termination of parental rights. (a) The responsible social services agency must ask
the county attorney to immediately file a termination of parental rights petition when:
      (1) the child has been subjected to egregious harm as defined in section 260C.007, subdivision
14;
      (2) the child is determined to be the sibling of a child who was subjected to egregious harm;
    (3) the child is an abandoned infant as defined in section 260C.301, subdivision 3, paragraph
(b), clause (2);
    (4) the child's parent has lost parental rights to another child through an order involuntarily
terminating the parent's rights;
    (5) the parent has committed sexual abuse as defined in section 626.556, subdivision 2, against
the child or another child of the parent;
    (6) the parent has committed an offense that requires registration as a predatory offender under
section 243.166, subdivision 1b, paragraph (a) or (b); or
91ST DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 22, 2012                                          4733

    (7) another child of the parent is the subject of an order involuntarily transferring permanent
legal and physical custody of the child to a relative under this chapter or a similar law of another
jurisdiction;
The county attorney shall file a termination of parental rights petition unless the conditions of
paragraph (d) are met.
    (b) When the termination of parental rights petition is filed under this subdivision, the responsible
social services agency shall identify, recruit, and approve an adoptive family for the child. If a
termination of parental rights petition has been filed by another party, the responsible social services
agency shall be joined as a party to the petition.
     (c) If criminal charges have been filed against a parent arising out of the conduct alleged to
constitute egregious harm, the county attorney shall determine which matter should proceed to trial
first, consistent with the best interests of the child and subject to the defendant's right to a speedy
trial.
   (d) The requirement of paragraph (a) does not apply if the responsible social services agency
and the county attorney determine and file with the court:
   (1) a petition for transfer of permanent legal and physical custody to a relative under sections
260C.505 and 260C.515, subdivision 3, including a determination that adoption is not in the child's
best interests and that transfer of permanent legal and physical custody is in the child's best interests;
or
    (2) a petition under section 260C.141 alleging the child, and where appropriate, the child's
siblings, to be in need of protection or services accompanied by a case plan prepared by the
responsible social services agency documenting a compelling reason why filing a termination of
parental rights petition would not be in the best interests of the child.
    Subd. 3. Calculating time to required permanency proceedings. (a) For purposes of this
section, the date of the child's placement in foster care is the earlier of the first court-ordered
placement or 60 days after the date on which the child has been voluntarily placed in foster care
by the child's parent or guardian. For purposes of this section, time spent by a child in the home
of the noncustodial parent pursuant to court order under section 260C.178 or under the protective
supervision of the responsible social services agency in the home of the noncustodial parent
pursuant to an order under section 260C.201, subdivision 1, counts towards the requirement of
a permanency hearing under this section. Time spent on a trial home visit counts towards the
requirement of a permanency hearing under this section and the permanency progress review
required under section 260C.204.
   (b) For the purposes of this section, 12 months is calculated as follows:
     (1) during the pendency of a petition alleging that a child is in need of protection or services,
all time periods when a child is placed in foster care or in the home of a noncustodial parent are
cumulated;
   (2) if a child has been placed in foster care within the previous five years under one or more
previous petitions, the lengths of all prior time periods when the child was placed in foster care
within the previous five years are cumulated. If a child under this clause has been in foster care for
12 months or more, the court, if it is in the best interests of the child and for compelling reasons,
4734                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [91ST DAY

may extend the total time the child may continue out of the home under the current petition up to
an additional six months before making a permanency determination.
    (c) If the child is on a trial home visit 12 months after the child was placed in foster care or in
the care of a noncustodial parent, the responsible social services agency may file a report with the
court regarding the child's and parent's progress on the trial home visit and the agency's reasonable
efforts to finalize the child's safe and permanent return to the care of the parent in lieu of filing the
petition required under section 260C.505. The court shall make findings regarding the reasonable
efforts of the agency to finalize the child's return home as the permanency disposition order in
the best interests of the child. The court may continue the trial home visit to a total time not to
exceed six months as provided in section 260C.201, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (3). If the
court finds the agency has not made reasonable efforts to finalize the child's return home as the
permanency disposition order in the child's best interests, the court may order other or additional
efforts to support the child remaining in the care of the parent. If a trial home visit ordered or
continued at permanency proceedings under sections 260C.503 to 260C.521 terminates, the court
shall commence or recommence permanency proceedings under this chapter no later than 30 days
after the child is returned to foster care or to the care of a noncustodial parent.
   Sec. 28. [260C.505] PETITION.
    (a) A permanency or termination of parental rights petition must be filed at or prior to the time
the child has been in foster care or in the care of a noncustodial or nonresident parent for 11 months
or in the expedited manner required in section 260C.503, subdivision 2, paragraph (a). The court
administrator shall serve the petition as required in the Minnesota Rules of Juvenile Protection
Procedure and section 260C.152 for the admit-deny hearing on the petition required in section
260C.507.
    (b) A petition under this section is not required if the responsible social services agency intends
to recommend that the child return to the care of the parent from whom the child was removed
at or prior to the time the court is required to hold the admit-deny hearing required under section
260C.507.
   Sec. 29. [260C.507] ADMIT-DENY HEARING.
    (a) An admit-deny hearing on the permanency or termination of parental rights petition shall be
held not later than 12 months from the child's placement in foster care or an order for the child to
be in the care of a noncustodial or nonresident parent.
    (b) An admit-deny hearing on the termination of parental rights or transfer of permanent legal
and physical custody petition required to be immediately filed under section 260C.503, subdivision
2, paragraph (a), shall be within ten days of the filing of the petition.
    (c) At the admit-deny hearing, the court shall determine whether there is a prima facie basis for
finding that the agency made reasonable efforts, or in the case of an Indian child active efforts, for
reunification as required or that reasonable efforts for reunification are not required under section
260.012 and proceed according to the Minnesota Rules of Juvenile Protection Procedure.
   Sec. 30. [260C.509] TRIAL.

required under section 260C.163 shall be commenced within 60 days of the admit-deny hearing

required under section 260C.507. At the conclusion of the permanency proceedings, the court shall:
   (1) order the child returned to the care of the parent or guardian from whom the child was
removed; or
    (2) order a permanency disposition under section 260C.515 or termination of parental rights
under sections 260C.301 to 260C.328 if a permanency disposition order or termination of parental
rights is in the child's best interests.
   Sec. 31. [260C.511] BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD.
   (a) The "best interests of the child" means all relevant factors to be considered and evaluated.
    (b) In making a permanency disposition order or termination of parental rights, the court must
be governed by the best interests of the child, including a review of the relationship between the
child and relatives and the child and other important persons with whom the child has resided or
had significant contact.
  Sec. 32. [260C.513] PERMANENCY DISPOSITIONS WHEN CHILD CANNOT
RETURN HOME.
    (a) Termination of parental rights and adoption, or guardianship to the commissioner of human
services through a consent to adopt are preferred permanency options for a child who cannot return
home. If the court finds that termination of parental rights and guardianship to the commissioner is
not in the child's best interests, the court may transfer permanent legal and physical custody of the
child to a relative when that order is in the child's best interests.
    (b) When the court has determined that permanent placement of the child away from the parent
is necessary, the court shall consider permanent alternative homes that are available both inside and
outside the state.
   Sec. 33. [260C.515] PERMANENCY DISPOSITION ORDERS.
   Subdivision 1. Court order required. If the child is not returned to the home at or before the

which case all the requirements of sections 260C.301 to 260C.328 remain applicable.
    Subd. 3. Guardianship; commissioner. The court may order guardianship to the commissioner
of human services under the following procedures and conditions:
   (1) there is an identified prospective adoptive parent agreed to by the responsible social services
agency having legal custody of the child pursuant to court order under this chapter and that
prospective adoptive parent has agreed to adopt the child;
   (2) the court accepts the parent's voluntary consent to adopt in writing on a form prescribed by

the commissioner, executed before two competent witnesses and confirmed by the consenting parent
before the court or executed before court. The consent shall contain notice that consent given under
this chapter:
   (i) is irrevocable upon acceptance by the court unless fraud is established and an order issues
permitting revocation as stated in clause (9) unless the matter is governed by the Indian Child
Welfare Act, United States Code, title 25, section 1913(c); and
    (ii) will result in an order that the child is under the guardianship of the commissioner of human
services;
    (3) a consent executed and acknowledged outside of this state, either in accordance with the law
of this state or in accordance with the law of the place where executed, is valid;
   (4) the court must review the matter at least every 90 days under section 260C.317;
    (5) a consent to adopt under this subdivision vests guardianship of the child with the
commissioner of human services and makes the child a ward of the commissioner of human
services under section 260C.325;
    (6) the court must forward to the commissioner a copy of the consent to adopt, together with a
certified copy of the order transferring guardianship to the commissioner;
    (7) if an adoption is not finalized by the identified prospective adoptive parent within six months
of the execution of the consent to adopt under this clause, the responsible social services agency
shall pursue adoptive placement in another home unless the court finds in a hearing under section
260C.317 that the failure to finalize is not due to either an action or a failure to act by the prospective
adoptive parent;
    (8) notwithstanding clause (7), the responsible social services agency must pursue adoptive
placement in another home as soon as the agency determines that finalization of the adoption with the
identified prospective adoptive parent is not possible, that the identified prospective adoptive parent
is not willing to adopt the child, or that the identified prospective adoptive parent is not cooperative
in completing the steps necessary to finalize the adoption;
    (9) unless otherwise required by the Indian Child Welfare Act, United States Code, title 25,
section 1913(c), a consent to adopt executed under this section shall be irrevocable upon acceptance
by the court except upon order permitting revocation issued by the same court after written findings
that consent was obtained by fraud.
    Subd. 4. Custody to relative. The court may order permanent legal and physical custody to a
relative in the best interests of the child according to the following conditions:
    (1) an order for transfer of permanent legal and physical custody to a relative shall only be made
after the court has reviewed the suitability of the prospective legal and physical custodian;

follow the standards applicable under this chapter and chapter 260, and the procedures in the
Minnesota Rules of Juvenile Protection Procedure;
    (3) a transfer of legal and physical custody includes responsibility for the protection, education,
care, and control of the child and decision making on behalf of the child;
91ST DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 22, 2012                                        4737

    (4) a permanent legal and physical custodian may not return a child to the permanent care of a
parent from whom the court removed custody without the court's approval and without notice to the
responsible social services agency;
   (5) the social services agency may file a petition naming a fit and willing relative as a proposed
permanent legal and physical custodian;
    (6) another party to the permanency proceeding regarding the child may file a petition to transfer
permanent legal and physical custody to a relative, but the petition must be filed not later than the
date for the required admit/deny hearing under section 260C.507; or if the agency's petition is filed
under section 260C.503, subdivision 2, the petition must be filed not later than 30 days prior to the
trial required under section 260C.509; and
    (7) the juvenile court may maintain jurisdiction over the responsible social services agency,
the parents or guardian of the child, the child, and the permanent legal and physical custodian for
purposes of ensuring appropriate services are delivered to the child and permanent legal custodian
for the purpose of ensuring conditions ordered by the court related to the care and custody of the
child are met.
    Subd. 5. Permanent custody to agency. The court may order permanent custody to the
responsible social services agency for continued placement of the child in foster care but only if
it approves the responsible social services agency's compelling reasons that no other permanency
disposition order is in the child's best interests, and:
   (1) the child has reached age 12;
   (2) the child is a sibling of a child described in clause (1) and the siblings have a significant
positive relationship and are ordered into the same foster home;
    (3) the responsible social services agency has made reasonable efforts to locate and place the
child with an adoptive family or a fit and willing relative who would either agree to adopt the child or
to a transfer of permanent legal and physical custody of the child, but these efforts have not proven
successful; and
    (4) the parent will continue to have visitation or contact with the child and will remain involved
in planning for the child.
    Subd. 6. Temporary legal custody to agency. The court may order temporary legal custody
to the responsible social services agency for continued placement of the child in foster care for a
specified period of time according to the following conditions:
    (1) the sole basis for an adjudication that the child is in need of protection or services is the
child's behavior;
    (2) the court finds that foster care for a specified period of time is in the best interests of the
child;
    (3) the court approves the responsible social services agency's compelling reasons that neither
an award of permanent legal and physical custody to a relative, nor termination of parental rights is
in the child's best interests; and
   (4) the order specifies that the child continue in foster care no longer than one year.

   Sec. 34. [260C.517] FINDINGS AND CONTENT OF ORDER FOR PERMANENCY
DISPOSITION.
    (a) Except for an order terminating parental rights, an order permanently placing a child out of
the home of the parent or guardian must include the following detailed findings:
      (1) how the child's best interests are served by the order;
    (2) the nature and extent of the responsible social services agency's reasonable efforts, or, in
the case of an Indian child, active efforts to reunify the child with the parent or guardian where
reasonable efforts are required;
    (3) the parent's or parents' efforts and ability to use services to correct the conditions which led
to the out-of-home placement; and
    (4) that the conditions which led to the out-of-home placement have not been corrected so that
the child can safely return home.
   (b) The court shall issue an order required under section 260C.515 and this section within 15
days of the close of the proceedings. The court may extend issuing the order an additional 15 days
when necessary in the interests of justice and the best interests of the child.
      Sec. 35. [260C.519] FURTHER COURT HEARINGS.
      Once a permanency disposition order has been made, further court hearings are necessary if:
   (1) the child is ordered on a trial home visit or under the protective supervision of the responsible
social services agency;
      (2) the child continues in foster care;
    (3) the court orders further hearings in a transfer of permanent legal and physical custody matter
including if a party seeks to modify an order under section 260C.521, subdivision 2;
      (4) an adoption has not yet been finalized; or
    (5) the child returns to foster care after the court has entered an order for a permanency
disposition under this section.
  Sec. 36. [260C.521] COURT REVIEWS AFTER PERMANENCY DISPOSITION
ORDER.
    Subdivision 1. Child in permanent custody of responsible social services agency. (a) Court
reviews of an order for permanent custody to the responsible social services agency for placement
of the child in foster care must be conducted at least yearly at an in-court appearance hearing.
      (b) The purpose of the review hearing is to ensure:
    (1) the order for permanent custody to the responsible social services agency for placement of
the child in foster care continues to be in the best interests of the child and that no other permanency
disposition order is in the best interests of the child;
      (2) that the agency is assisting the child to build connections to the child's family and community;
and
91ST DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 22, 2012                                         4739

    (3) that the agency is appropriately planning with the child for development of independent
living skills for the child, and as appropriate, for the orderly and successful transition to independent
living that may occur if the child continues in foster care without another permanency disposition
order.
    (c) The court must review the child's out-of-home placement plan and the reasonable efforts of
the agency to finalize an alternative permanent plan for the child including the agency's efforts to:
    (1) ensure that permanent custody to the agency with placement of the child in foster care
continues to be the most appropriate legal arrangement for meeting the child's need for permanency
and stability or, if not, to identify and attempt to finalize another permanency disposition order under
this chapter that would better serve the child's needs and best interests;
   (2) identify a specific foster home for the child, if one has not already been identified;
   (3) support continued placement of the child in the identified home, if one has been identified;
    (4) ensure appropriate services are provided to address the physical health, mental health, and
educational needs of the child during the period of foster care and also ensure appropriate services
or assistance to maintain relationships with appropriate family members and the child's community;
and
    (5) plan for the child's independence upon the child's leaving foster care living as required under
section 260C.212, subdivision 1.
   (d) The court may find that the agency has made reasonable efforts to finalize the permanent
plan for the child when:
    (1) the agency has made reasonable efforts to identify a more legally permanent home for the
child than is provided by an order for permanent custody to the agency for placement in foster care;
and
   (2) the agency's engagement of the child in planning for independent living is reasonable and
appropriate.
    Subd. 2. Modifying an order for permanent legal and physical custody to a relative. An
order for a relative to have permanent legal and physical custody of a child may be modified using
standards under sections 518.18 and 518.185. The social services agency is a party to the proceeding
and must receive notice.
    Subd. 3. Modifying order for permanent custody to agency for placement in foster care. (a)
A parent may seek modification of an order for permanent custody of the child to the responsible
social services agency for placement in foster care upon motion and a showing by the parent of a
substantial change in the parent's circumstances such that the parent could provide appropriate care
for the child and that removal of the child from the permanent custody of the agency and the return
to the parent's care would be in the best interests of the child.
    (b) The responsible social services agency may ask the court to vacate an order for permanent
custody to the agency upon a petition and hearing pursuant to section 260C.163 establishing
the basis for the court to order another permanency disposition under this chapter, including
termination of parental rights based on abandonment if the parent has not visited the child,
4740                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [91ST DAY

maintained contact with the child, or participated in planning for the child as required under section
260C.515, subdivision 5. The responsible social services agency must establish that the proposed
permanency disposition order is in the child's bests interests. Upon a hearing where the court
determines the petition is proved, the court may vacate the order for permanent custody and enter
a different order for a permanent disposition that is in the child's best interests. The court shall
not require further reasonable efforts to reunify the child with the parent or guardian as a basis
for vacating the order for permanent custody to the agency and ordering a different permanency
disposition in the child's best interests. The county attorney must file the petition and give notice as
required under the Minnesota Rules of Juvenile Protection Procedure in order to modify an order
for permanent custody under this subdivision.

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256.01, subdivision 14b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 14b. American Indian child welfare projects. (a) The commissioner of human services
may authorize projects to test tribal delivery of child welfare services to American Indian children
and their parents and custodians living on the reservation. The commissioner has authority to
solicit and determine which tribes may participate in a project. Grants may be issued to Minnesota
Indian tribes to support the projects. The commissioner may waive existing state rules as needed
to accomplish the projects. Notwithstanding section 626.556, the commissioner may authorize
projects to use alternative methods of investigating and assessing reports of child maltreatment,
provided that the projects comply with the provisions of section 626.556 dealing with the rights
of individuals who are subjects of reports or investigations, including notice and appeal rights
and data practices requirements. The commissioner may seek any federal approvals necessary to
carry out the projects as well as seek and use any funds available to the commissioner, including
use of federal funds, foundation funds, existing grant funds, and other funds. The commissioner
is authorized to advance state funds as necessary to operate the projects. Federal reimbursement
applicable to the projects is appropriated to the commissioner for the purposes of the projects.
The projects must be required to address responsibility for safety, permanency, and well-being of
children.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, "American Indian child" means a person under 1   ­­
                                                                                            8y­­a­

 ­­e 21 years old and who is a tribal member or eligible for membership in one of the tribes chosen
for a project under this subdivision and who is residing on the reservation of that tribe.
   (c) In order to qualify for an American Indian child welfare project, a tribe must:
   (1) be one of the existing tribes with reservation land in Minnesota;
   (2) have a tribal court with jurisdiction over child custody proceedings;
   (3) have a substantial number of children for whom determinations of maltreatment have
occurred;
   (4) have capacity to respond to reports of abuse and neglect under section 626.556;
   (5) provide a wide range of services to families in need of child welfare services; and
91ST DAY]                           THURSDAY, MARCH 22, 2012                                      4741

      (6) have a tribal-state title IV-E agreement in effect.
   (d) Grants awarded under this section may be used for the nonfederal costs of providing child
welfare services to American Indian children on the tribe's reservation, including costs associated
with:
      (1) assessment and prevention of child abuse and neglect;
      (2) family preservation;
      (3) facilitative, supportive, and reunification services;
      (4) out-of-home placement for children removed from the home for child protective purposes;
and
    (5) other activities and services approved by the commissioner that further the goals of providing
safety, permanency, and well-being of American Indian children.
    (e) When a tribe has initiated a project and has been approved by the commissioner to assume
child welfare responsibilities for American Indian children of that tribe under this section, the
affected county social service agency is relieved of responsibility for responding to reports of
abuse and neglect under section 626.556 for those children during the time within which the tribal
project is in effect and funded. The commissioner shall work with tribes and affected counties to
develop procedures for data collection, evaluation, and clarification of ongoing role and financial
responsibilities of the county and tribe for child welfare services prior to initiation of the project.
Children who have not been identified by the tribe as participating in the project shall remain the
responsibility of the county. Nothing in this section shall alter responsibilities of the county for law
enforcement or court services.
    (f) Participating tribes may conduct children's mental health screenings under section 245.4874,
subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (14), for children who are eligible for the initiative and living
on the reservation and who meet one of the following criteria:
      (1) the child must be receiving child protective services;
      (2) the child must be in foster care; or
      (3) the child's parents must have had parental rights suspended or terminated.
Tribes may access reimbursement from available state funds for conducting the screenings. Nothing
in this section shall alter responsibilities of the county for providing services under section 245.487.
    (g) Participating tribes may establish a local child mortality review panel. In establishing a local
child mortality review panel, the tribe agrees to conduct local child mortality reviews for child deaths
or near-fatalities occurring on the reservation under subdivision 12. Tribes with established child
mortality review panels shall have access to nonpublic data and shall protect nonpublic data under
subdivision 12, paragraphs (c) to (e). The tribe shall provide written notice to the commissioner and
affected counties when a local child mortality review panel has been established and shall provide
data upon request of the commissioner for purposes of sharing nonpublic data with members of the
state child mortality review panel in connection to an individual case.
      (h) The commissioner shall collect information on outcomes relating to child safety, permanency,

and well-being of American Indian children who are served in the projects. Participating tribes must
provide information to the state in a format and completeness deemed acceptable by the state to meet
state and federal reporting requirements.

state for a tribunal of another state to modify the order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
    (b) A tribunal of this state issuing a child support order consistent with the law of this state
may not exercise its continuing jurisdiction to modify the order if the order has been modified by a
tribunal of another state pursuant to this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter.
    (c) If a child support order of this state is modified by a tribunal of another state pursuant to
this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter, a tribunal of this state loses its continuing,
exclusive jurisdiction with regard to prospective enforcement of the order issued in this state, and
may only:
    (1) enforce the order that was modified as to amounts accruing before the modification;
    (2) enforce nonmodifiable aspects of that order; and
    (3) provide other appropriate relief for violations of that order which occurred before the
effective date of the modification.
   (d) A tribunal of this state shall recognize the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of a tribunal of
another state which has issued a child support order pursuant to this chapter or a law substantially
similar to this chapter.
   (e) A temporary support order issued ex parte or pending resolution of a jurisdictional conflict
does not create continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in the issuing tribunal.

special needs under section 259A.70.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 260C.301, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Voluntary and involuntary. The juvenile court may upon petition, terminate all
rights of a parent to a child:
     (a) with the written consent of a parent who for good cause desires to terminate parental rights;
or
     (b) if it finds that one or more of the following conditions exist:
     (1) that the parent has abandoned the child;
    (2) that the parent has substantially, continuously, or repeatedly refused or neglected to comply
with the duties imposed upon that parent by the parent and child relationship, including but not
limited to providing the child with necessary food, clothing, shelter, education, and other care and
control necessary for the child's physical, mental, or emotional health and development, if the parent
is physically and financially able, and either reasonable efforts by the social services agency have
failed to correct the conditions that formed the basis of the petition or reasonable efforts would be
futile and therefore unreasonable;
    (3) that a parent has been ordered to contribute to the support of the child or financially aid in
the child's birth and has continuously failed to do so without good cause. This clause shall not be
construed to state a grounds for termination of parental rights of a noncustodial parent if that parent
has not been ordered to or cannot financially contribute to the support of the child or aid in the child's
birth;
    (4) that a parent is palpably unfit to be a party to the parent and child relationship because of a
consistent pattern of specific conduct before the child or of specific conditions directly relating to
the parent and child relationship either of which are determined by the court to be of a duration or
nature that renders the parent unable, for the reasonably foreseeable future, to care appropriately for
the ongoing physical, mental, or emotional needs of the child. It is presumed that a parent is palpably
unfit to be a party to the parent and child relationship upon a showing that the parent's parental rights
to one or more other children were involuntarily terminated or that the parent's custodial rights to
another child have been involuntarily transferred to a relative under section 260C.201, subdivision
11, paragraph (e), clause (1), or a similar law of another jurisdiction;
    (5) that following the child's placement out of the home, reasonable efforts, under the direction
of the court, have failed to correct the conditions leading to the child's placement. It is presumed
that reasonable efforts under this clause have failed upon a showing that:
    (i) a child has resided out of the parental home under court order for a cumulative period of 12
months within the preceding 22 months. In the case of a child under age eight at the time the petition
was filed alleging the child to be in need of protection or services, the presumption arises when
the child has resided out of the parental home under court order for six months unless the parent
has maintained regular contact with the child and the parent is complying with the out-of-home
placement plan;
    (ii) the court has approved the out-of-home placement plan required under section 260C.212 and
filed with the court under section 260C.178;
91ST DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 22, 2012                                        4745

    (iii) conditions leading to the out-of-home placement have not been corrected. It is presumed
that conditions leading to a child's out-of-home placement have not been corrected upon a showing
that the parent or parents have not substantially complied with the court's orders and a reasonable
case plan; and
   (iv) reasonable efforts have been made by the social services agency to rehabilitate the parent
and reunite the family.
    This clause does not prohibit the termination of parental rights prior to one year, or in the case
of a child under age eight, prior to six months after a child has been placed out of the home.
   It is also presumed that reasonable efforts have failed under this clause upon a showing that:
    (A) the parent has been diagnosed as chemically dependent by a professional certified to make
the diagnosis;
   (B) the parent has been required by a case plan to participate in a chemical dependency treatment
program;
   (C) the treatment programs offered to the parent were culturally, linguistically, and clinically
appropriate;
    (D) the parent has either failed two or more times to successfully complete a treatment program
or has refused at two or more separate meetings with a caseworker to participate in a treatment
program; and
   (E) the parent continues to abuse chemicals.
    (6) that a child has experienced egregious harm in the parent's care which is of a nature, duration,
or chronicity that indicates a lack of regard for the child's well-being, such that a reasonable person
would believe it contrary to the best interest of the child or of any child to be in the parent's care;
    (7) that in the case of a child born to a mother who was not married to the child's father when the
child was conceived nor when the child was born the person is not entitled to notice of an adoption
hearing under section 259.49 and the person has not registered with the fathers' adoption registry
under section 259.52;
   (8) that the child is neglected and in foster care; or
    (9) that the parent has been convicted of a crime listed in section 260.012, paragraph (g), clauses
(1) to ­
       (3
        ­­) (5).
   In an action involving an American Indian child, sections 260.751 to 260.835 and the Indian
Child Welfare Act, United States Code, title 25, sections 1901 to 1923, control to the extent that the
provisions of this section are inconsistent with those laws.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 260D.08, is amended to read:
   260D.08 ANNUAL REVIEW.
    (a) After the court conducts a permanency review hearing under section 260D.07, the matter
must be returned to the court for further review of the responsible social services reasonable efforts
to finalize the permanent plan for the child and the child's foster care placement at least every 12
4746                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [91ST DAY

months while the child is in foster care. The court shall give notice to the parent and child, age
12 or older, and the foster parents of the continued review requirements under this section at the
permanency review hearing.
    (b) Every 12 months, the court shall determine whether the agency made reasonable efforts to
finalize the permanency plan for the child, which means the exercise of due diligence by the agency
to:
    (1) ensure that the agreement for voluntary foster care is the most appropriate legal arrangement
to meet the child's safety, health, and best interests and to conduct a genuine examination of whether
there is another permanency disposition order under chapter 260C, including returning the child
home, that would better serve the child's need for a stable and permanent home;
    (2) engage and support the parent in continued involvement in planning and decision making
for the needs of the child;
   (3) strengthen the child's ties to the parent, relatives, and community;
   (4) implement the out-of-home placement plan required under section 260C.212, subdivision 1,
and ensure that the plan requires the provision of appropriate services to address the physical health,
mental health, and educational needs of the child; and
    (5) ensure appropriate planning for the child's safe, permanent, and independent living
arrangement after the child's 18th birthday.
   Sec. 6. [611.012] DISPOSITION OF CHILD OF PARENT ARRESTED.
    A peace officer who arrests a person accompanied by a child of the person may release the
child to any person designated by the parent unless it is necessary to remove the child under section
260C.175 because the child is found in surroundings or conditions which endanger the child's health
or welfare or which the peace officer reasonably believes will endanger the child's health or welfare.
An officer releasing a child under this section to a person designated by the parent has no civil or
criminal liability for the child's release.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 626.556, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the meanings given them
unless the specific content indicates otherwise:
    (a) "Family assessment" means a comprehensive assessment of child safety, risk of subsequent
child maltreatment, and family strengths and needs that is applied to a child maltreatment report that
does not allege substantial child endangerment. Family assessment does not include a determination
as to whether child maltreatment occurred but does determine the need for services to address the
safety of family members and the risk of subsequent maltreatment.
    (b) "Investigation" means fact gathering related to the current safety of a child and the risk of
subsequent maltreatment that determines whether child maltreatment occurred and whether child
protective services are needed. An investigation must be used when reports involve substantial
child endangerment, and for reports of maltreatment in facilities required to be licensed under
chapter 245A or 245B; under sections 144.50 to 144.58 and 241.021; in a school as defined in
sections 120A.05, subdivisions 9, 11, and 13, and 124D.10; or in a nonlicensed personal care

    (d) "Sexual abuse" means the subjection of a child by a person responsible for the child's care,
by a person who has a significant relationship to the child, as defined in section 609.341, or by a
person in a position of authority, as defined in section 609.341, subdivision 10, to any act which
constitutes a violation of section 609.342 (criminal sexual conduct in the first degree), 609.343
(criminal sexual conduct in the second degree), 609.344 (criminal sexual conduct in the third
degree), 609.345 (criminal sexual conduct in the fourth degree), or 609.3451 (criminal sexual

    (f) "Neglect" means the commission or omission of any of the acts specified under clauses (1)
to (9), other than by accidental means:
    (1) failure by a person responsible for a child's care to supply a child with necessary food,
clothing, shelter, health, medical, or other care required for the child's physical or mental health
when reasonably able to do so;
    (2) failure to protect a child from conditions or actions that seriously endanger the child's physical
or mental health when reasonably able to do so, including a growth delay, which may be referred to

   (4) failure to ensure that the child is educated as defined in sections 120A.22 and 260C.163,
subdivision 11, which does not include a parent's refusal to provide the parent's child with
sympathomimetic medications, consistent with section 125A.091, subdivision 5;
    (5) nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that a child is neglected solely because
the child's parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's care in good faith selects and
depends upon spiritual means or prayer for treatment or care of disease or remedial care of the child
in lieu of medical care; except that a parent, guardian, or caretaker, or a person mandated to report
pursuant to subdivision 3, has a duty to report if a lack of medical care may cause serious danger
to the child's health. This section does not impose upon persons, not otherwise legally responsible
for providing a child with necessary food, clothing, shelter, education, or medical care, a duty to
provide that care;
    (6) prenatal exposure to a controlled substance, as defined in section 253B.02, subdivision 2,

functioning of the child which may be demonstrated by a substantial and observable effect in the
child's behavior, emotional response, or cognition that is not within the normal range for the child's
age and stage of development, with due regard to the child's culture.

services were both in compliance with all licensing requirements relevant to the incident.
    This definition only applies to child care centers licensed under Minnesota Rules, chapter 9503.
If clauses (1) to (5) apply, rather than making a determination of substantiated maltreatment by the
individual, the commissioner of human services shall determine that a nonmaltreatment mistake
was made by the individual.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 626.556, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Duties of local welfare agency and local law enforcement agency upon receipt of
report. (a) Upon receipt of a report, the local welfare agency shall determine whether to conduct
a family assessment or an investigation as appropriate to prevent or provide a remedy for child
maltreatment. The local welfare agency:
   (1) shall conduct an investigation on reports involving substantial child endangerment;
    (2) shall begin an immediate investigation if, at any time when it is using a family assessment
response, it determines that there is reason to believe that substantial child endangerment or a serious
threat to the child's safety exists;
   (3) may conduct a family assessment for reports that do not allege substantial child
endangerment. In determining that a family assessment is appropriate, the local welfare agency may
consider issues of child safety, parental cooperation, and the need for an immediate response; and
   (4) may conduct a family assessment on a report that was initially screened and assigned for an
investigation. In determining that a complete investigation is not required, the local welfare agency
must document the reason for terminating the investigation and notify the local law enforcement
agency if the local law enforcement agency is conducting a joint investigation.
    If the report alleges neglect, physical abuse, or sexual abuse by a parent, guardian, or individual
functioning within the family unit as a person responsible for the child's care, or sexual abuse by a
person with a significant relationship to the child when that person resides in the child's household
or by a sibling, the local welfare agency shall immediately conduct a family assessment or
investigation as identified in clauses (1) to (4). In conducting a family assessment or investigation,
the local welfare agency shall gather information on the existence of substance abuse and domestic
violence and offer services for purposes of preventing future child maltreatment, safeguarding and
enhancing the welfare of the abused or neglected minor, and supporting and preserving family life
whenever possible. If the report alleges a violation of a criminal statute involving sexual abuse,
physical abuse, or neglect or endangerment, under section 609.378, the local law enforcement
agency and local welfare agency shall coordinate the planning and execution of their respective
investigation and assessment efforts to avoid a duplication of fact-finding efforts and multiple
interviews. Each agency shall prepare a separate report of the results of its investigation. In cases
of alleged child maltreatment resulting in death, the local agency may rely on the fact-finding
efforts of a law enforcement investigation to make a determination of whether or not maltreatment
occurred. When necessary the local welfare agency shall seek authority to remove the child from
4752                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [91ST DAY

the custody of a parent, guardian, or adult with whom the child is living. In performing any of these
duties, the local welfare agency shall maintain appropriate records.
   If the family assessment or investigation indicates there is a potential for abuse of alcohol or
other drugs by the parent, guardian, or person responsible for the child's care, the local welfare
agency shall conduct a chemical use assessment pursuant to Minnesota Rules, part 9530.6615.
    (b) When a local agency receives a report or otherwise has information indicating that a child
who is a client, as defined in section 245.91, has been the subject of physical abuse, sexual abuse, or
neglect at an agency, facility, or program as defined in section 245.91, it shall, in addition to its other
duties under this section, immediately inform the ombudsman established under sections 245.91 to
245.97. The commissioner of education shall inform the ombudsman established under sections
245.91 to 245.97 of reports regarding a child defined as a client in section 245.91 that maltreatment
occurred at a school as defined in sections 120A.05, subdivisions 9, 11, and 13, and 124D.10.
    (c) Authority of the local welfare agency responsible for assessing or investigating the child
abuse or neglect report, the agency responsible for assessing or investigating the report, and of the
local law enforcement agency for investigating the alleged abuse or neglect includes, but is not
limited to, authority to interview, without parental consent, the alleged victim and any other minors
who currently reside with or who have resided with the alleged offender. The interview may take
place at school or at any facility or other place where the alleged victim or other minors might be
found or the child may be transported to, and the interview conducted at, a place appropriate for
the interview of a child designated by the local welfare agency or law enforcement agency. The
interview may take place outside the presence of the alleged offender or parent, legal custodian,
guardian, or school official. For family assessments, it is the preferred practice to request a parent
or guardian's permission to interview the child prior to conducting the child interview, unless doing
so would compromise the safety assessment. Except as provided in this paragraph, the parent, legal
custodian, or guardian shall be notified by the responsible local welfare or law enforcement agency
no later than the conclusion of the investigation or assessment that this interview has occurred.
Notwithstanding rule 32 of the Minnesota Rules of Procedure for Juvenile Courts, the juvenile court
may, after hearing on an ex parte motion by the local welfare agency, order that, where reasonable
cause exists, the agency withhold notification of this interview from the parent, legal custodian, or
guardian. If the interview took place or is to take place on school property, the order shall specify
that school officials may not disclose to the parent, legal custodian, or guardian the contents of the
notification of intent to interview the child on school property, as provided under this paragraph, and
any other related information regarding the interview that may be a part of the child's school record.
A copy of the order shall be sent by the local welfare or law enforcement agency to the appropriate
school official.
    (d) When the local welfare, local law enforcement agency, or the agency responsible for
assessing or investigating a report of maltreatment determines that an interview should take place
on school property, written notification of intent to interview the child on school property must be
received by school officials prior to the interview. The notification shall include the name of the
child to be interviewed, the purpose of the interview, and a reference to the statutory authority to
conduct an interview on school property. For interviews conducted by the local welfare agency, the
notification shall be signed by the chair of the local social services agency or the chair's designee.
The notification shall be private data on individuals subject to the provisions of this paragraph.
School officials may not disclose to the parent, legal custodian, or guardian the contents of the
91ST DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 22, 2012                                       4753

notification or any other related information regarding the interview until notified in writing by the
local welfare or law enforcement agency that the investigation or assessment has been concluded,
unless a school employee or agent is alleged to have maltreated the child. Until that time, the
local welfare or law enforcement agency or the agency responsible for assessing or investigating
a report of maltreatment shall be solely responsible for any disclosures regarding the nature of the
assessment or investigation.
    Except where the alleged offender is believed to be a school official or employee, the time and
place, and manner of the interview on school premises shall be within the discretion of school
officials, but the local welfare or law enforcement agency shall have the exclusive authority to
determine who may attend the interview. The conditions as to time, place, and manner of the
interview set by the school officials shall be reasonable and the interview shall be conducted not
more than 24 hours after the receipt of the notification unless another time is considered necessary
by agreement between the school officials and the local welfare or law enforcement agency. Where
the school fails to comply with the provisions of this paragraph, the juvenile court may order the
school to comply. Every effort must be made to reduce the disruption of the educational program
of the child, other students, or school staff when an interview is conducted on school premises.
    (e) Where the alleged offender or a person responsible for the care of the alleged victim or other
minor prevents access to the victim or other minor by the local welfare agency, the juvenile court
may order the parents, legal custodian, or guardian to produce the alleged victim or other minor for
questioning by the local welfare agency or the local law enforcement agency outside the presence
of the alleged offender or any person responsible for the child's care at reasonable places and times
as specified by court order.
    (f) Before making an order under paragraph (e), the court shall issue an order to show cause,
either upon its own motion or upon a verified petition, specifying the basis for the requested
interviews and fixing the time and place of the hearing. The order to show cause shall be served
personally and shall be heard in the same manner as provided in other cases in the juvenile court.
The court shall consider the need for appointment of a guardian ad litem to protect the best interests
of the child. If appointed, the guardian ad litem shall be present at the hearing on the order to show
cause.
    (g) The commissioner of human services, the ombudsman for mental health and developmental
disabilities, the local welfare agencies responsible for investigating reports, the commissioner of
education, and the local law enforcement agencies have the right to enter facilities as defined in
subdivision 2 and to inspect and copy the facility's records, including medical records, as part of the
investigation. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 13, they also have the right to inform the
facility under investigation that they are conducting an investigation, to disclose to the facility the
names of the individuals under investigation for abusing or neglecting a child, and to provide the
facility with a copy of the report and the investigative findings.
    (h) The local welfare agency responsible for conducting a family assessment or investigation
shall collect available and relevant information to determine child safety, risk of subsequent child
maltreatment, and family strengths and needs and share not public information with an Indian's
tribal social services agency without violating any law of the state that may otherwise impose duties
of confidentiality on the local welfare agency in order to implement the tribal state agreement. The
local welfare agency or the agency responsible for investigating the report shall collect available
and relevant information to ascertain whether maltreatment occurred and whether protective
4754                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [91ST DAY

services are needed. Information collected includes, when relevant, information with regard to the
person reporting the alleged maltreatment, including the nature of the reporter's relationship to
the child and to the alleged offender, and the basis of the reporter's knowledge for the report; the
child allegedly being maltreated; the alleged offender; the child's caretaker; and other collateral
sources having relevant information related to the alleged maltreatment. The local welfare agency

   Information relevant to the assessment or investigation must be asked for, and may include:
    (1) the child's sex and age, prior reports of maltreatment, information relating to developmental
functioning, credibility of the child's statement, and whether the information provided under
this clause is consistent with other information collected during the course of the assessment or
investigation;
    (2) the alleged offender's age, a record check for prior reports of maltreatment, and criminal
charges and convictions. The local welfare agency or the agency responsible for assessing
or investigating the report must provide the alleged offender with an opportunity to make a
statement. The alleged offender may submit supporting documentation relevant to the assessment
or investigation;
    (3) collateral source information regarding the alleged maltreatment and care of the child.
Collateral information includes, when relevant: (i) a medical examination of the child; (ii) prior
medical records relating to the alleged maltreatment or the care of the child maintained by any
facility, clinic, or health care professional and an interview with the treating professionals; and (iii)
interviews with the child's caretakers, including the child's parent, guardian, foster parent, child
care provider, teachers, counselors, family members, relatives, and other persons who may have
knowledge regarding the alleged maltreatment and the care of the child; and
   (4) information on the existence of domestic abuse and violence in the home of the child, and
substance abuse.
    Nothing in this paragraph precludes the local welfare agency, the local law enforcement agency,
or the agency responsible for assessing or investigating the report from collecting other relevant
information necessary to conduct the assessment or investigation. Notwithstanding sections 13.384
or 144.291 to 144.298, the local welfare agency has access to medical data and records for purposes
of clause (3). Notwithstanding the data's classification in the possession of any other agency, data
acquired by the local welfare agency or the agency responsible for assessing or investigating the
report during the course of the assessment or investigation are private data on individuals and must
be maintained in accordance with subdivision 11. Data of the commissioner of education collected
or maintained during and for the purpose of an investigation of alleged maltreatment in a school
are governed by this section, notwithstanding the data's classification as educational, licensing, or
personnel data under chapter 13.
    In conducting an assessment or investigation involving a school facility as defined in subdivision
2, paragraph (i), the commissioner of education shall collect investigative reports and data that are
relevant to a report of maltreatment and are from local law enforcement and the school facility.
   (i) Upon receipt of a report, the local welfare agency shall conduct a face-to-face contact with
91ST DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 22, 2012                                        4755

the child reported to be maltreated and with the child's primary caregiver sufficient to complete a
safety assessment and ensure the immediate safety of the child. The face-to-face contact with the
child and primary caregiver shall occur immediately if substantial child endangerment is alleged and
within five calendar days for all other reports. If the alleged offender was not already interviewed
as the primary caregiver, the local welfare agency shall also conduct a face-to-face interview with
the alleged offender in the early stages of the assessment or investigation. At the initial contact, the
local child welfare agency or the agency responsible for assessing or investigating the report must
inform the alleged offender of the complaints or allegations made against the individual in a manner
consistent with laws protecting the rights of the person who made the report. The interview with the
alleged offender may be postponed if it would jeopardize an active law enforcement investigation.
    (j) When conducting an investigation, the local welfare agency shall use a question and answer
interviewing format with questioning as nondirective as possible to elicit spontaneous responses.
For investigations only, the following interviewing methods and procedures must be used whenever
possible when collecting information:
   (1) audio recordings of all interviews with witnesses and collateral sources; and
    (2) in cases of alleged sexual abuse, audio-video recordings of each interview with the alleged
victim and child witnesses.
    (k) In conducting an assessment or investigation involving a school facility as defined in
subdivision 2, paragraph (i), the commissioner of education shall collect available and relevant
information and use the procedures in paragraphs (i), (k), and subdivision 3d, except that the
requirement for face-to-face observation of the child and face-to-face interview of the alleged
offender is to occur in the initial stages of the assessment or investigation provided that the
commissioner may also base the assessment or investigation on investigative reports and data
received from the school facility and local law enforcement, to the extent those investigations
satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (i) and (k), and subdivision 3d.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 626.556, subdivision 10e, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10e. Determinations. (a) The local welfare agency shall conclude the family assessment
or the investigation within 45 days of the receipt of a report. The conclusion of the assessment or
investigation may be extended to permit the completion of a criminal investigation or the receipt of
expert information requested within 45 days of the receipt of the report.
    (b) After conducting a family assessment, the local welfare agency shall determine whether
services are needed to address the safety of the child and other family members and the risk of
subsequent maltreatment.
     (c) After conducting an investigation, the local welfare agency shall make two determinations:
first, whether maltreatment has occurred;­ and, second, whether child protective services are needed.
No determination of maltreatment shall be made when the alleged perpetrator is a child under the
age of ten.
    (d) If the commissioner of education conducts an assessment or investigation, the commissioner
shall determine whether maltreatment occurred and what corrective or protective action was taken
by the school facility. If a determination is made that maltreatment has occurred, the commissioner
shall report to the employer, the school board, and any appropriate licensing entity the determination
4756                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [91ST DAY

that maltreatment occurred and what corrective or protective action was taken by the school facility.
In all other cases, the commissioner shall inform the school board or employer that a report was
received, the subject of the report, the date of the initial report, the category of maltreatment alleged
as defined in paragraph (f), the fact that maltreatment was not determined, and a summary of the
specific reasons for the determination.
    (e) When maltreatment is determined in an investigation involving a facility, the investigating
agency shall also determine whether the facility or individual was responsible, or whether both the
facility and the individual were responsible for the maltreatment using the mitigating factors in
paragraph (i). Determinations under this subdivision must be made based on a preponderance of the
evidence and are private data on individuals or nonpublic data as maintained by the commissioner
of education.
   (f) For the purposes of this subdivision, "maltreatment" means any of the following acts or
omissions:
   (1) physical abuse as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (g);
   (2) neglect as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (f);
   (3) sexual abuse as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (d);
   (4) mental injury as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (m); or
   (5) maltreatment of a child in a facility as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (i).
    (g) For the purposes of this subdivision, a determination that child protective services are
needed means that the local welfare agency has documented conditions during the assessment
or investigation sufficient to cause a child protection worker, as defined in section 626.559,
subdivision 1, to conclude that a child is at significant risk of maltreatment if protective intervention
is not provided and that the individuals responsible for the child's care have not taken or are not
likely to take actions to protect the child from maltreatment or risk of maltreatment.
    (h) This subdivision does not mean that maltreatment has occurred solely because the child's
parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's care in good faith selects and depends
upon spiritual means or prayer for treatment or care of disease or remedial care of the child, in lieu
of medical care. However, if lack of medical care may result in serious danger to the child's health,
the local welfare agency may ensure that necessary medical services are provided to the child.
   (i) When determining whether the facility or individual is the responsible party, or whether
both the facility and the individual are responsible for determined maltreatment in a facility, the
investigating agency shall consider at least the following mitigating factors:
    (1) whether the actions of the facility or the individual caregivers were according to, and followed
the terms of, an erroneous physician order, prescription, individual care plan, or directive; however,
this is not a mitigating factor when the facility or caregiver was responsible for the issuance of the
erroneous order, prescription, individual care plan, or directive or knew or should have known of
the errors and took no reasonable measures to correct the defect before administering care;
   (2) comparative responsibility between the facility, other caregivers, and requirements placed
upon an employee, including the facility's compliance with related regulatory standards and the

adequacy of facility policies and procedures, facility training, an individual's participation in the
training, the caregiver's supervision, and facility staffing levels and the scope of the individual
employee's authority and discretion; and
   (3) whether the facility or individual followed professional standards in exercising professional
judgment.
The evaluation of the facility's responsibility under clause (2) must not be based on the completeness
of the risk assessment or risk reduction plan required under section 245A.66, but must be based on
the facility's compliance with the regulatory standards for policies and procedures, training, and
supervision as cited in Minnesota Statutes and Minnesota Rules.
    (j) Notwithstanding paragraph (i), when maltreatment is determined to have been committed
by an individual who is also the facility license holder, both the individual and the facility must
be determined responsible for the maltreatment, and both the background study disqualification
standards under section 245C.15, subdivision 4, and the licensing actions under sections 245A.06
or 245A.07 apply.
    (k) Individual counties may implement more detailed definitions or criteria that indicate which
allegations to investigate, as long as a county's policies are consistent with the definitions in
the statutes and rules and are approved by the county board. Each local welfare agency shall
periodically inform mandated reporters under subdivision 3 who work in the county of the
definitions of maltreatment in the statutes and rules and any additional definitions or criteria that
have been approved by the county board.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 626.556, subdivision 10f, is amended to read:
     Subd. 10f. Notice of determinations. Within ten working days of the conclusion of a family
assessment, the local welfare agency shall notify the parent or guardian of the child of the need
for services to address child safety concerns or significant risk of subsequent child maltreatment.
The local welfare agency and the family may also jointly agree that family support and family
preservation services are needed. Within ten working days of the conclusion of an investigation, the

o r investigating the report shall notify the private licensing agency of the determination and shall
provide a summary of the specific reasons for the determination. The notice to the private licensing
agency must include identifying private data, but not the identity of the reporter of maltreatment.
The notice must also include a certification that the information collection procedures under
subdivision 10, paragraphs (h), (i), and (j), were followed and a notice of the right of a data subject
to obtain access to other private data on the subject collected, created, or maintained under this
section. In addition, the notice shall include the length of time that the records will be kept under
subdivision 11c. The investigating agency shall notify the parent or guardian of the child who
is the subject of the report, and any person or facility determined to have maltreated a child, of
their appeal or review rights under this section or section 256.022. The notice must also state
that a finding of maltreatment may result in denial of a license application or background study
disqualification under chapter 245C related to employment or services that are licensed by the

Department of Human Services under chapter 245A, the Department of Health under chapter 144
or 144A, the Department of Corrections under section 241.021, and from providing services related
to an unlicensed personal care provider organization under chapter 256B.
     Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 626.556, subdivision 10i, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10i. Administrative reconsideration; review panel. (a) Administrative reconsideration
is not applicable in family assessments since no determination concerning maltreatment is made.
For investigations, except as provided under paragraph (e), an individual or facility that the
commissioner of human services, a local social service agency, or the commissioner of education
determines has maltreated a child, an interested person acting on behalf of the child, regardless
of the determination, who contests the investigating agency's final determination regarding
maltreatment, may request the investigating agency to reconsider its final determination regarding
maltreatment. The request for reconsideration must be submitted in writing to the investigating
agency within 15 calendar days after receipt of notice of the final determination regarding
maltreatment or, if the request is made by an interested person who is not entitled to notice, within
15 days after receipt of the notice by the parent or guardian of the child. If mailed, the request for
reconsideration must be postmarked and sent to the investigating agency within 15 calendar days
of the individual's or facility's receipt of the final determination. If the request for reconsideration
is made by personal service, it must be received by the investigating agency within 15 calendar
days after the individual's or facility's receipt of the final determination. Effective January 1,
2002, an individual who was determined to have maltreated a child under this section and who
was disqualified on the basis of serious or recurring maltreatment under sections 245C.14 and
245C.15, may request reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification.
The request for reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification must
be submitted within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice of disqualification
under sections 245C.16 and 245C.17. If mailed, the request for reconsideration of the maltreatment
determination and the disqualification must be postmarked and sent to the investigating agency
within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the maltreatment determination and notice of
disqualification. If the request for reconsideration is made by personal service, it must be received
by the investigating agency within 30 calendar days after the individual's receipt of the notice of
disqualification.
      (b) Except as provided under paragraphs (e) and (f), if the investigating agency denies the request
or fails to act upon the request within 15 working days after receiving the request for reconsideration,
the person or facility entitled to a fair hearing under section 256.045 may submit to the commissioner
of human services or the commissioner of education a written request for a hearing under that
section. Section 256.045 also governs hearings requested to contest a final determination of the
commissioner of education. F                  ­o­­r­ r­ep­­o­

to accuracy and completeness challenges under section 13.04.
    (c) If, as a result of a reconsideration or review, the investigating agency changes the final
determination of maltreatment, that agency shall notify the parties specified in subdivisions 10b,
10d, and 10f.
    (d) Except as provided under paragraph (f), if an individual or facility contests the investigating
agency's final determination regarding maltreatment by requesting a fair hearing under section
256.045, the commissioner of human services shall assure that the hearing is conducted and a
decision is reached within 90 days of receipt of the request for a hearing. The time for action on
the decision may be extended for as many days as the hearing is postponed or the record is held
open for the benefit of either party.
    (e) If an individual was disqualified under sections 245C.14 and 245C.15, on the basis
of a determination of maltreatment, which was serious or recurring, and the individual has
requested reconsideration of the maltreatment determination under paragraph (a) and requested
reconsideration of the disqualification under sections 245C.21 to 245C.27, reconsideration of the
maltreatment determination and reconsideration of the disqualification shall be consolidated into
a single reconsideration. If reconsideration of the maltreatment determination is denied and the
individual remains disqualified following a reconsideration decision, the individual may request
a fair hearing under section 256.045. If an individual requests a fair hearing on the maltreatment
determination and the disqualification, the scope of the fair hearing shall include both the
maltreatment determination and the disqualification.
    (f) If a maltreatment determination or a disqualification based on serious or recurring
maltreatment is the basis for a denial of a license under section 245A.05 or a licensing sanction
under section 245A.07, the license holder has the right to a contested case hearing under chapter
14 and Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612. As provided for under section 245A.08,
subdivision 2a, the scope of the contested case hearing shall include the maltreatment determination,
disqualification, and licensing sanction or denial of a license. In such cases, a fair hearing regarding
the maltreatment determination and disqualification shall not be conducted under section 256.045.
Except for family child care and child foster care, reconsideration of a maltreatment determination
as provided under this subdivision, and reconsideration of a disqualification as provided under
section 245C.22, shall also not be conducted when:
    (1) a denial of a license under section 245A.05 or a licensing sanction under section 245A.07,
is based on a determination that the license holder is responsible for maltreatment or the
disqualification of a license holder based on serious or recurring maltreatment;
    (2) the denial of a license or licensing sanction is issued at the same time as the maltreatment
determination or disqualification; and
    (3) the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination or disqualification, and denial of
a license or licensing sanction.
    Notwithstanding clauses (1) to (3), if the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination
or disqualification, but does not appeal the denial of a license or a licensing sanction, reconsideration
of the maltreatment determination shall be conducted under sections 626.556, subdivision 10i, and
626.557, subdivision 9d, and reconsideration of the disqualification shall be conducted under section
245C.22. In such cases, a fair hearing shall also be conducted as provided under sections 245C.27,

626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d.
   If the disqualified subject is an individual other than the license holder and upon whom a
background study must be conducted under chapter 245C, the hearings of all parties may be
consolidated into a single contested case hearing upon consent of all parties and the administrative
law judge.

parent or legal guardian; stepparent; grandparent; guardian ad litem; adult stepbrother, stepsister, or
sibling; or adult aunt or uncle; unless the person has been determined to be the perpetrator of the
maltreatment.

audit report has been issued.

legislature on the management of the school trust lands that shows how the commissioner has and
will continue to achieve the following goals:
   (1) manage the school trust lands efficiently;
   (2) reduce the management expenditures of school trust lands and maximize the revenues
deposited in the permanent school trust fund;
   (3) manage the sale, exchange, and commercial leasing of school trust lands to maximize the
revenues deposited in the permanent school trust fund and retain the value from the long-term
appreciation of the school trust lands; and

school trust fund while maintaining sound natural resource conservation and management
principles.
    (b) When the commissioner finds an irresolvable conflict between maximizing the long-term
economic return and protecting natural resources and recreational values on school trust lands, the
commissioner shall give precedence to the long-term economic return in managing school trust
lands. By July 1, 2016, the permanent school fund shall be compensated for all school trust lands
included under a designation or policy provision that prohibits long-term economic return. Any
uncompensated designation or policy provision restrictions on the long-term economic return on
school trust lands is removed on July 1, 2016, and the lands shall be managed for long-term economic
return to the permanent school fund.
   (c) The first 2013 report required under paragraph (a) shall provide an inventory and
identification of all school trust lands that are included under a designation or policy provision that
prohibits long-term economic return. The report shall include a plan to compensate the permanent
school fund through the purchase or exchange of the lands or a plan to manage the school trust
land to generate long-term economic return to the permanent school fund. Subsequent reports
under paragraph (a) shall include a status report of the commissioner's progress in maximizing the
long-term economic return on lands identified in the first 2013 report.
    (d) When future designations or policies prohibit the long-term economic return on school trust
land, the conflict shall be resolved by compensating the permanent school fund through an exchange
or purchase of the lands before designation or application of the policy.

for new law in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 518; repealing Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 518.17,
subdivision 2.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 518.175, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. General. (a) In all proceedings for dissolution or legal separation, subsequent to
the commencement of the proceeding and continuing thereafter during the minority of the child, the
court shall, upon the request of either parent, grant such parenting time on behalf of the child and a
parent as will enable the child and the parent to maintain a child to parent relationship that will be
in the best interests of the child.
    If the court finds, after a hearing, that parenting time with a parent is likely to endanger the
child's physical or emotional health or impair the child's emotional development, the court shall
restrict parenting time with that parent as to time, place, duration, or supervision and may deny
parenting time entirely, as the circumstances warrant. The court shall consider the age of the child
and the child's relationship with the parent prior to the commencement of the proceeding.
   A parent's failure to pay support because of the parent's inability to do so shall not be sufficient
cause for denial of parenting time.
   (b) The court may provide that a law enforcement officer or other appropriate person will
accompany a party seeking to enforce or comply with parenting time.
    (c) Upon request of either party, to the extent practicable an order for parenting time must
include a specific schedule for parenting time, including the frequency and duration of visitation
and visitation during holidays and vacations, unless parenting time is restricted, denied, or reserved.
    (d) The court administrator shall provide a form for a pro se motion regarding parenting time
disputes, which includes provisions for indicating the relief requested, an affidavit in which the party
may state the facts of the dispute, and a brief description of the parenting time expeditor process
under section 518.1751. The form may not include a request for a change of custody. The court shall
provide instructions on serving and filing the motion.
    (e) In the absence of other evidence, there is a rebuttable presumption that a parent is entitled
to receive at least 2
                    ­5­ 35 percent of the parenting time for the child. For purposes of this paragraph,
the percentage of parenting time may be determined by calculating the number of overnights that a
child spends with a parent or by using a method other than overnights if the parent has significant
time periods on separate days when the child is in the parent's physical custody but does not stay
overnight. The court may consider the age of the child in determining whether a child is with a
parent for a significant period of time.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 518A.36, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Calculation of parenting expense adjustment. The obligor is entitled to a parenting
expense adjustment calculated as provided in this subdivision. The court shall:
    (1) find the adjustment percentage corresponding to the percentage of parenting time allowed to
the obligor below:

(i)                           less than 10 percent                no adjustment
(ii)                          10 percent to 4

(iii)                         30.1 percent to 45 percent          35 percent

 i­i                          45.1 percent to 50 percent          presume parenting time is equal

    (2) multiply the adjustment percentage by the obligor's basic child support obligation to arrive
at the parenting expense adjustment; and
   (3) subtract the parenting expense adjustment from the obligor's basic child support obligation.
The result is the obligor's basic support obligation after parenting expense adjustment.
       Sec. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE; APPLICATION.
    (a) Sections 1 and 2 are effective January 1, 2013, and apply to orders adopted or modified on
or after that date.
    (b) There must be no modification of an existing parenting time order based on the amendment
to the parenting time presumption under section 1 until July 1, 2014, unless the child's environment
presently endangers the child's physical or emotional health or impairs the child's emotional
development.
    (c) There must be no modification of an existing child support order based on the amendments
to the parenting expense adjustment under section 2 until July 1, 2014, unless the court finds that
other grounds for modification exist under Minnesota Statutes, section 518A.39."
