of polling place rosters that include the voter's name, address, date of birth, school district number,
and space for the voter's signature. The address listed on the polling place roster must be the voter's
address of residence, unless the voter has requested that the address printed on the roster be the
voter's mailing address because the voter is a judge, or a law enforcement or corrections officer.
The secretary of state may prescribe additional election-related information to be placed on the
polling place rosters on an experimental basis for one state primary and general election cycle; the
same information may not be placed on the polling place roster for a second state primary and
general election cycle unless specified in this subdivision. The polling place roster must be used
to indicate whether the voter has voted in a given election. The secretary of state shall prescribe
procedures for transporting the polling place rosters to the election judges for use on election day.
The secretary of state shall prescribe the form for a county or municipality to request the date of
birth from currently registered voters. The county or municipality shall not request the date of birth
from currently registered voters by any communication other than the prescribed form and the form
must clearly indicate that a currently registered voter does not lose registration status by failing to
provide the date of birth. In accordance with section 204B.40, the county auditor shall retain the
prescribed polling place rosters used on the date of election for 22 months following the election.

voter shall deliver the voter's receipt to the judge in charge of ballots as proof of the voter's right
to vote, and thereupon the judge shall hand to the voter the ballot. The voters' receipts must be

provided in section 204C.135.
     Sec. 11. [204C.135] PROVISIONAL BALLOTS.
    Subdivision 1. Casting of provisional ballots. (a) The following voters seeking to vote are
entitled to cast a provisional ballot in the manner provided by this section:
     (1) a voter who is unable to provide proper photo identification as required by section 204C.10;
     (2) a voter whose registration status is listed as "challenged" on the polling place roster; and
     (3) a voter whose eligibility to vote is challenged as permitted by section 204C.12.
    (b) A voter seeking to vote a provisional ballot must sign a provisional ballot roster and complete
a provisional ballot envelope. The envelope must contain a space for the voter to list the voter's
name, address of residence, date of birth, voter identification number, and any other information
prescribed by the secretary of state. The voter must also swear or affirm, in writing, that the voter is
eligible to vote, has not voted previously in the same election, and meets the criteria for registering
to vote in the precinct in which the voter appears.
    Once the voter has completed the provisional ballot envelope, the voter must be allowed to cast
a provisional ballot. The provisional ballot must be in the same form as the official ballot available
in the precinct on election day. A completed provisional ballot shall be sealed in a secrecy envelope.
The secrecy envelope shall be sealed inside the voter's provisional ballot envelope and deposited
by the voter in a secure, sealed provisional ballot box. Completed provisional ballots may not be
combined with other voted ballots in the polling place.
    (c) The form of the secrecy and provisional ballot envelopes shall be prescribed by the secretary
of state. The provisional ballot envelope must be a color other than that provided for absentee ballot
envelopes and must be prominently labeled "Provisional Ballot Envelope."
    (d) Provisional ballots and related documentation shall be delivered to and securely maintained
by the county auditor or municipal clerk in the same manner as required for other election materials

under sections 204C.27 to 204C.28.
    Subd. 2. Counting provisional ballots. (a) A voter who casts a provisional ballot in the polling
place may personally appear before the county auditor or municipal clerk no later than seven
calendar days following the election to prove that the voter's provisional ballot should be counted.
The county auditor or municipal clerk must count a provisional ballot in the final certified results
from the precinct if:
   (1) the statewide voter registration system indicates that the voter is eligible to vote or, if
challenged, the voter presents evidence of the voter's eligibility to vote; and
    (2) the voter presents proof of identity and residence in the precinct in the manner permitted by
section 200.035.
    (b) If a voter does not appear before the county auditor or municipal clerk within seven calendar
days following the election or otherwise does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a), or if the
data listed on the items of identification presented by the voter does not match the data submitted
by the voter on the provisional ballot envelope, the voter's provisional ballot must not be counted.
    (c) The county auditor or municipal clerk must notify, in writing, any provisional voter who
does not appear within seven calendar days of the election that the voter's provisional ballot was not
counted because of the voter's failure to appear before the county auditor or municipal clerk within
the time permitted by law to determine whether the provisional ballot should be counted.
    Subd. 3. Provisional ballots; reconciliation. Prior to counting any provisional ballots in the final
vote totals from a precinct, the county auditor must verify that the number of signatures appearing
on the provisional ballot roster from that precinct is equal to or greater than the number of accepted
provisional ballots submitted by voters in the precinct on election day. Any discrepancy must be
resolved before the provisional ballots from the precinct may be counted. Excess provisional ballots
to be counted must be randomly withdrawn in the manner required by section 204C.20, subdivision
2, after the period for a voter to appear to prove residence and identity has expired and the ballots
to be counted have been separated from the provisional ballot envelopes.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 204C.14, is amended to read:
   204C.14 UNLAWFUL VOTING; PENALTY.
   No individual shall intentionally:
    (a) misrepresent the individual's identity in applying for a ballot, depositing a ballot in a ballot
box, requesting a provisional ballot or requesting that a provisional ballot be counted, or attempting

   (b) vote more than once at the same election;
   (c) put a ballot in a ballot box for any illegal purpose;
    (d) give more than one ballot of the same kind and color to an election judge to be placed in a
ballot box;
   (e) aid, abet, counsel or procure another to go into any precinct for the purpose of voting in that
precinct, knowing that the other individual is not eligible to vote in that precinct; or

by the county auditor or municipal clerk to see if the person has already voted by absentee ballot.
If the person's name appears on the list, the election judge must not allow the individual to register
or to vote in the polling place. The election judges shall also review the list of individuals believed
to be ineligible to vote using the electronic roster, or a paper list provided by the county auditor
or municipal clerk. The election judge who registers an individual at the polling place on election
day shall not handle that voter's ballots at any time prior to the opening of the ballot box after the

form containing the oath shall be attached to the individual's registration application. Registration
applications completed on election day shall be forwarded to the county auditor who shall add
the name of each voter to the registration system unless the information forwarded is substantially
deficient. A county auditor who finds an election day registration substantially deficient shall give
written notice to the individual whose registration is found deficient. An election day registration
shall not be found deficient solely because the individual who provided proof of residence was
ineligible to do so.

the voter's name, address, date of birth, current and valid Minnesota driver's license number or
Minnesota state identification number, or if the voter has no current and valid Minnesota driver's
license or Minnesota state identification number, the last four digits of the voter's Social Security

    A voter registration application accepted before January 1, 2004, is not deficient for lack
of a valid Minnesota driver's license or state identification number or the last four digits of a
Social Security number. A voter registration application submitted by a voter who does not have
a Minnesota driver's license or state identification number, or a Social Security number, is not
deficient for lack of any of these numbers.
    Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 201.081, is amended to read:
    201.081 REGISTRATION FILES.
    The statewide registration system is the official record of registered voters. The voter registration
applications and the terminal providing access to the statewide registration system must be under
the control of the county auditor or the public official to whom the county auditor has delegated
the responsibility for maintaining voter registration records. The voter registration applications and
terminals providing access to the statewide registration system must not be removed from the control
of the county auditor except as provided in this section. The county auditor may make photographic
copies of voter registration applications in the manner provided by section 138.17.
    A properly completed voter registration application that has been submitted to the secretary of
state or a county auditor must be maintained by the secretary of state or the county auditor for at
least 2
      ­2­ 36 months after the date that the information on the application is entered into the database
of the statewide registration system. The secretary of state or the county auditor may dispose of the
applications after retention for ­
                                 22­ 36 months in the manner provided by section 138.17.

application is properly completed, submitted, and received in accordance with sections 201.061
and 201.071, the county auditor shall enter the information contained on it into the statewide
registration system. Voter registration applications completed before election day must be entered
into the statewide registration system within ten days after they have been submitted to the county
auditor. Voter registration applications completed on election day must be entered into the statewide
registration system within 42 days after the election,           ­­u

soon as possible for review by the county auditor before final entry into the statewide registration
system. The secretary of state may mail the voter registration application to the county auditor.
    (c) Within ten days after the county auditor has entered information from a voter registration
application into the statewide registration system, the secretary of state shall compare the voter's
name, date of birth, and driver's license number, state identification number, or the last four digits of
the Social Security number with the same information contained in the Department of Public Safety
database.
    (d) The secretary of state shall provide a report to the county auditor on a weekly basis that
includes a list of voters whose name, date of birth, or identification number have been compared
with the same information in the Department of Public Safety database and cannot be verified as
provided in this subdivision. The report must list separately those voters who have submitted a voter
registration application by mail and have not voted in a federal election in this state.
    (e) The county auditor shall compile a list of voters for whom the county auditor and the
secretary of state are unable to conclude that information on the voter registration application and
the corresponding information in the Department of Public Safety database relate to the same
person.
    (f) The county auditor shall send a notice of incomplete registration to any voter whose name
appears on the list and change the voter's status to "incomplete." A voter who receives a notice
of incomplete registration from the county auditor may either provide the information required to
complete the registration at least 21 days before the next election or at the polling place on election
day.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 201.121, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Postelection sampling. Within ten days after an election, the county auditor shall send
the notice required by subdivision 2 to a random sampling of the individuals registered on election
day. The random sampling shall be determined in accordance with the rules of the secretary of state.
As soon as practicable after the election, but no later than January 1 of the following year, the county
auditor shall mail the notice required by subdivision 2 to all other individuals registered on election
day. If a notice is returned as not deliverable, the county auditor shall attempt to determine the reason
for the return. A county auditor who does not receive or obtain satisfactory proof of an individual's
eligibility to vote shall immediately notify the county attorney of all of the relevant information
and the secretary of state of the numbers by precinct. By March 1 of every odd-numbered year,
the secretary of state shall report to the chair and ranking minority members of the legislative
committees with jurisdiction over elections the number of notices reported under this subdivision
to the secretary of state for the previous state general election by county and precinct.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 201.171, is amended to read:
  201.171 POSTING VOTING HISTORY; FAILURE TO VOTE; REGISTRATION
REMOVED.
    Within six weeks after every election, the county auditor shall post the voting history for
every person who voted in the election. After the close of the calendar year, the secretary of state
shall determine if any registrants have not voted during the preceding four years. The secretary
of state shall perform list maintenance by changing the status of those registrants to "inactive" in

the statewide registration system. The list maintenance performed must be conducted in a manner
that ensures that the name of each registered voter appears in the official list of eligible voters in
the statewide registration system. A voter must not be removed from the official list of eligible
voters unless the voter is not eligible or is not registered to vote. List maintenance must include
procedures for eliminating duplicate names from the official list of eligible voters.
     The secretary of state shall also prepare a report to the county auditor containing the names of
all registrants whose status was changed to "inactive."
    Registrants whose status was changed to "inactive" must register in the manner specified in
section 201.054 before voting in any primary, special primary, general, school district, or special
election, as required by section 201.018.
    Although not counted in an election, a late or rejected absentee or mail ballot must be considered
a vote for the purpose of continuing registration under this section, but is not considered voting

    Sec. 13. [201.197] CHALLENGED ELIGIBILITY LIST.
    (a) The secretary of state shall maintain an electronic database of individuals not registered
and who are believed to be ineligible to vote under section 201.014, subdivision 2. The database
may be maintained as a module of the statewide voter registration system, if permitted by federal
law, or maintained as a separate database, and at a minimum must include an individual's name,
address of residence, date of birth, the reason the individual is believed to be ineligible to vote
and, if available, the individual's driver's license or state identification card number, or the last four
digits of the individual's Social Security number. Entries in the database shall be compiled using
data submitted to the secretary of state under this chapter, and other sources as the secretary may
determine appropriate.
    (b) An elections official processing a voter registration application must verify whether the
individual listed on the application is included in the database of individuals known to be ineligible
to vote. If the individual is listed in the database, the voter registration application may be accepted,
but the voter's status must be listed as "challenged." An election judge processing a voter registration
application submitted by a voter in a polling place on election day must verify the application using
the electronic roster, or if the polling place does not have an electronic roster, using a paper list
provided by the county auditor. A paper list used for verification in a polling place may be limited
to only those individuals known to be residents of the county in which the precinct is located.
    Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 201.221, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Procedures for polling place rosters. The secretary of state shall prescribe the form
of polling place rosters that include the voter's name, address, date of birth, school district number,
and space for the voter's signature. The secretary of state may prescribe additional election-related
information to be placed on the polling place rosters on an experimental basis for one state primary
and general election cycle; the same information may not be placed on the polling place roster for a
second state primary and general election cycle unless specified in this subdivision. The polling place
roster must be used to indicate whether the voter has voted in a given election. The secretary of state
shall prescribe procedures for transporting the polling place rosters to the election judges for use on
election day. The secretary of state shall prescribe the form for a county or municipality to request
the date of birth from currently registered voters. The county or municipality shall not request the

date of birth from currently registered voters by any communication other than the prescribed form
and the form must clearly indicate that a currently registered voter does not lose registration status
by failing to provide the date of birth. In accordance with section 204B.40, the county auditor shall
retain the prescribed polling place rosters used on the date of election for ­
                                                                             2­2 36 months following
the election.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 203B.04, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Application procedures. (a) Except as otherwise allowed by subdivision 2 or by
section 203B.11, subdivision 4, an application for absentee ballots for any election may be submitted
at any time not less than one day before the day of that election. The county auditor shall prepare
absentee ballot application forms in the format provided by the secretary of state and shall furnish
them to any person on request. By January 1 of each even-numbered year, the secretary of state shall
make the forms to be used available to auditors through electronic means. An application submitted
pursuant to this subdivision shall be in writing and shall be submitted to:
   (1) the county auditor of the county where the applicant maintains residence; or
   (2) the municipal clerk of the municipality, or school district if applicable, where the applicant
maintains residence.
   (b) An application shall be approved if it is timely received, signed and dated by the applicant,
and contains:

    To be approved, the application must state that the applicant is eligible to vote by absentee ballot
for one of the reasons specified in section 203B.02, and must contain an oath that the information
contained on the form is accurate, that the applicant is applying on the applicant's own behalf, and
that the applicant is signing the form under penalty of perjury.
    Prior to approval, the county auditor or municipal clerk must verify that the Minnesota driver's
license or state identification card number submitted by an applicant is valid and assigned to that
applicant. An application that contains a driver's license or identification card number that is invalid
or not assigned to the applicant must be rejected. The county auditor or municipal clerk must also
verify that the applicant does not appear on any lists of known ineligible voters maintained by
574                                       JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                             [27TH DAY

the county auditor or municipal clerk, or provided to the county auditor or municipal clerk by the
secretary of state. When verifying eligibility, the county auditor or municipal clerk must use the
same standards and process as used for individuals appearing in the polling place on election day,
except that an applicant is not required to appear in person or present photo identification meeting
the standards of section 204C.10, subdivision 2.
    (c) An applicant's full date of birth, Minnesota driver's license or state identification number,
and the last four digits of the applicant's Social Security number must not be made available for
public inspection. An application may be submitted to the county auditor or municipal clerk by an
electronic facsimile device. An application mailed or returned in person to the county auditor or
municipal clerk on behalf of a voter by a person other than the voter must be deposited in the mail
or returned in person to the county auditor or municipal clerk within ten days after it has been dated
by the voter and no later than six days before the election. The absentee ballot applications or a list
of persons applying for an absentee ballot may not be made available for public inspection until the
close of voting on election day.
   An application under this subdivision may contain an application under subdivision 5 to
automatically receive an absentee ballot application.
    Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 203B.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Health care patient. An eligible voter who on the day before an election becomes a
resident or patient in a health care facility or hospital located in the municipality in which the eligible
voter maintains residence may apply for absentee ballots on election day if the voter:     ­

    Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 203B.121, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Establishment; applicable laws. (a) The governing body of each county,
municipality, and school district with responsibility to accept and reject absentee ballots must, by

election judges trained in the handling of absentee ballots and appointed as provided in sections
204B.19 to 204B.22. The board may include staff trained as election judges.
    (b) Each jurisdiction must pay a reasonable compensation to each member of that jurisdiction's

must be scheduled, announced, and posted on the Web site of the governing body of the county,
municipality, or school district at least 14 days prior to convening the first meeting of the ballot
board for an election. If the governing body of the county, municipality, or school district does not
have a Web site, the time and place of each meeting must be posted, in writing, on the principle
bulletin board of the body. Meetings of the ballot board must be convened at the same time and in
the same location. The ballot board must also meet on any day during which the county or municipal
offices are open for the purposes of conducting election business prior to an election. A ballot board
may not meet except during regularly scheduled meetings announced and posted as required by this
paragraph.
   (d) Except as otherwise provided by this section, all provisions of the Minnesota Election Law
apply to a ballot board.
     Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 204B.40, is amended to read:
   204B.40 BALLOTS; ELECTION RECORDS                                                   AND        OTHER            MATERIALS;
DISPOSITION; INSPECTION OF BALLOTS.
    The county auditors, municipal clerks, and school district clerks shall retain all election materials
returned to them after any election for at least ­ 22
                                                    ­ 36 months from the date of that election. All
election materials involved in a contested election must be retained for 2   ­2
                                                                              ­ 36 months or until the
contest has been finally determined, whichever is later. Abstracts filed by canvassing boards shall be
retained permanently by any officer with whom those abstracts are filed. Election materials no longer
required to be retained pursuant to this section shall be disposed of in accordance with sections
138.163 to 138.21. Sealed envelopes containing voted ballots must be retained unopened, except as
provided in this section, in a secure location. The county auditor, municipal clerk, or school district
clerk shall not permit any voted ballots to be tampered with or defaced.
     After the time for filing a notice of contest for an election has passed, the secretary of state
may, for the purpose of monitoring and evaluating election procedures: (1) open the sealed ballot
envelopes and inspect the ballots for that election maintained by the county auditors, municipal
clerks, or school district clerks; (2) inspect the polling place rosters and completed voter registration
applications; or (3) examine other forms required in the Minnesota election laws for use in the
polling place. No inspected ballot or document may be marked or identified in any manner. After
inspection, all ballots must be returned to the ballot envelope and the ballot envelope must be
securely resealed. Any other election materials inspected or examined must be secured or resealed.

Without considering how the ballots are marked, the election judges shall ascertain that each ballot
is separate and shall count them to determine whether the number of ballots in the box corresponds
with the number of ballots to be counted.
   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 204C.20, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Excess ballots. If two or more ballots are found folded together like a single ballot, the
election judges shall lay them aside until all the ballots in the box have been counted. If it is evident
from the number of ballots to be counted that the ballots folded together were cast by one voter,
the election judges shall preserve but not count them. If the number of ballots in one box exceeds
the number to be counted, the election judges shall examine all the ballots in the box to ascertain
that all are properly marked with the initials of the election judges. If any ballots are not properly
marked with the initials of the election judges, the election judges shall preserve but not count them;
however, if the number of ballots does not exceed the number to be counted, the absence of either or
both sets of initials of the election judges does not, by itself, disqualify the vote from being counted

marked ballots, the election judges shall replace them in the box, and one election judge, without
looking, shall withdraw from the box a number of ballots equal to the excess. The withdrawn ballots
shall not be counted but shall be preserved as provided in subdivision 4.
   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 204C.20, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Ballots not counted; disposition. When the final count of ballots agrees with the
number of ballots to be counted, those ballots not counted shall be clearly marked "excess" on the
front of the ballot and attached to a certificate made by the election judges which states the number
of ballots not counted and why ­h  t­­

election judges shall sign their names over the envelope seal and return the ballots to the county
auditor or municipal or school district clerk from whom they were received. Tabulation of vote
totals from a precinct where excess ballots were removed from the ballot box shall be completed by
the canvassing board responsible for certifying the election results from that precinct.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 204C.20, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 5. Applicability. The requirements of this section apply regardless of the voting system
or method of tabulation used in a precinct.
   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 204C.23, is amended to read:
   204C.23 SPOILED, DEFECTIVE, AND DUPLICATE BALLOTS.
    (a) A ballot that is spoiled by a voter must be clearly marked "spoiled" by an election judge,
placed in an envelope designated for spoiled ballots from the precinct, sealed, and returned as
required by section 204C.25.
      (b) A ballot that is defective to the extent that the election judges are unable to determine the
voter's intent shall be marked on the back "Defective" if it is totally defective or "Defective as to
......," naming the office or question if it is defective only in part. Defective ballots must be placed
in an envelope designated for defective ballots from the precinct, sealed, and returned as required
by section 204C.25.

    Subdivision 1. Manner; time; contents. Service of a notice of contest must be made in the
same manner as the service of summons in civil actions. The notice of contest must specify the
grounds on which the contest will be made. The contestant shall serve notice of the contest on the
parties enumerated in this section. Notice must be served and filed within five days after the canvass
is completed in the case of a primary or special primary or within seven days after the canvass is
completed in the case of a special or general election; except that:
     (1) if a contest is based on a deliberate, serious, and material violation of the election laws which
was discovered from the statements of receipts and disbursements required to be filed by candidates
and committees, the action may be commenced and the notice served and filed within ten days after
the filing of the statements in the case of a general or special election or within five days after the
filing of the statements in the case of a primary or special primary.    ­;
    (2) if a notice of contest questions only which party received the highest number of votes legally
cast at the election, a contestee who loses may serve and file a notice of contest on any other ground
during the three days following expiration of the time for appealing the decision on the vote count;
and
     (3) if data or documents necessary to determine grounds for a contest, including but not limited
to lists of the names of every voter who participated in an election, are not available to a candidate
or the general public prior to the close of the period for filing a notice of contest under this section
due to nonfeasance, malfeasance, or failure to perform duties within the time required by statute
on the part of the secretary of state, a county auditor, or other state, county, or municipal election
official, a notice of contest may be served and filed within seven days after the data or documents
become available for inspection by the candidates and the general public.

envelopes, applications for absentee ballots, precinct summary statements, printouts from voting
machines, and precinct incident logs, inspected before preparing for trial. The party requesting an
inspection shall file with the district court where the contest is brought a verified petition, stating that
the case cannot properly be prepared for trial without an inspection of the ballots and designating
the precincts in which an inspection is desired. A judge of the court in which the contest is pending
shall then appoint as many sets of three inspectors for a contest of any office or question as are
needed to count and inspect the ballots expeditiously. One inspector must be selected by each of the
parties to the contest and a third must be chosen by those two inspectors. If either party neglects or
refuses to name an inspector, the judge shall appoint the inspector. The compensation of inspectors
is the same as for referees, unless otherwise stipulated.
      Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 211B.11, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Soliciting near polling places. A person may not display campaign material, post
signs, ask, solicit, or in any manner try to induce or persuade a voter within a polling place or within
100 feet of the building in which a polling place is situated, or anywhere on the public property on
which a polling place is situated, on primary or election day to vote for or refrain from voting for a
candidate or ballot question. A person may not provide political badges, political buttons, or other
political insignia to be worn at or about the polling place on the day of a primary or election. A
political badge, political button, or other political insignia may not be worn at or about the polling
place on primary or election day if it is designed to influence voting for or against a particular
candidate, political party, or question on the ballot at the election. This section applies to areas
established by the county auditor or municipal clerk for absentee voting as provided in chapter
203B.
    The secretary of state, county auditor, municipal clerk, or school district clerk may provide
stickers which contain the words "I VOTED" and nothing more. Election judges may offer a sticker
of this type to each voter who has signed the polling place roster or a voter's receipt.
      Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 611A.32, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Duties of grantees. (a) Every public or private nonprofit agency which receives a grant
to provide emergency shelter services to battered women and support services to battered women
and domestic abuse victims shall:
      (1) comply with all rules of the commissioner related to the administration of the pilot programs;
and
    (2) provide information to all battered women receiving assistance from a shelter facility, as
defined in section 611A.37, subdivision 4, on the address confidentiality program established in
chapter 5B, including an application for the program and information on the right of individuals
certified as program participants to vote by absentee ballot as permitted in section 5B.06.
      Sec. 32. REPEALER.
      Minnesota Statutes 2010, sections 203B.04, subdivision 3 is repealed.

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 200.02, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 12a. Polling place roster. "Polling place roster" means the official lists used to record a
voter's appearance in a polling place on election day, including the list of registered voters in the
precinct, and the list of voters registering on election day. A polling place roster may be in a printed
or electronic format, as permitted by section 201.225.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 201.221, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Procedures for polling place rosters. The secretary of state shall prescribe the form
of polling place rosters that include the voter's name, address, date of birth, school district number,
and space for the voter's signature. A polling place roster provided in an electronic form must allow
for a printed voter's receipt that meets the standards provided in section 201.225, subdivision 2.
The secretary of state may prescribe additional election-related information to be placed on the
polling place rosters on an experimental basis for one state primary and general election cycle; the
same information may not be placed on the polling place roster for a second state primary and
general election cycle unless specified in this subdivision. The polling place roster must be used
to indicate whether the voter has voted in a given election. The secretary of state shall prescribe
procedures for transporting the polling place rosters to the election judges for use on election day.
The secretary of state shall prescribe the form for a county or municipality to request the date of birth
from currently registered voters. The county or municipality shall not request the date of birth from
currently registered voters by any communication other than the prescribed form and the form must
clearly indicate that a currently registered voter does not lose registration status by failing to provide
the date of birth. In accordance with section 204B.40, the county auditor shall retain the prescribed
polling place rosters used on the date of election for 2­2
                                                         ­ 36 months following the election.
   Sec. 3. [201.225] ELECTRONIC ROSTER; STANDARDS.
    Subdivision 1. Certification of system. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c), a precinct may
have a secure electronic connection to the statewide voter registration system maintained by the
secretary of state, to serve as the precinct's electronic polling place roster.
    (b) Precincts may not use an electronic roster until the secretary of state has certified that the
secure electronic connection to the statewide voter registration system is sufficient to prevent any
voter from voting more than once at an election and to prevent access to the system by unauthorized
individuals.
    (c) If the county auditor or municipal clerk certifies to the secretary of state that a precinct is
unable to access the connection, the precinct may use two computers connected together in the
precinct as the electronic roster. At a minimum, computers used in a precinct that do not have a
live connection to the statewide voter registration system must have a stored electronic roster of
registered voters for that precinct.
   Subd. 2. Minimum standards for electronic rosters. At a minimum, an electronic roster must:
    (1) be preloaded with data from the statewide voter registration system, including data on
individuals known to be ineligible to vote;
   (2) permit all voting information processed by any computer in a precinct to be immediately
accessible to all other computers at all other connected precincts in the state;

    (3) provide for a printed voter's receipt, containing the voter's name, address of residence, date of
birth, voter identification number, the oath required by section 204C.10, and a space for the voter's
original signature;
    (4) immediately alert the election judge if the statewide voter registration system indicates that
a voter has already voted at the election in another polling place, is ineligible to vote, or the voter's
registration status is challenged;
   (5) automatically accept and input data from a scanned Minnesota driver's license or
identification card and match the data to an existing voter registration record, and permit manual
input of voter data, if necessary; and
    (6) perform any other functions required for the efficient and secure administration of an election,
as required by law.
    Subd. 3. Use of alternative roster. Any precinct that opts not to use an electronic poll book must
use an alternative roster that ensures election day registrations are subject to the same verification
standards as defined in subdivision 2, clauses (1), (2), (3), and (6).
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 204B.14, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Separate precincts; combined polling place. (a) The following shall constitute at least
one election precinct:
   (1) each city ward; and
   (2) each town and each statutory city.
   (b) A single, accessible, combined polling place may be established no later than May 1 of any
year:
   (1) for any city of the third or fourth class, any town, or any city having territory in more than
one county, in which all the voters of the city or town shall cast their ballots;
   (2) for two contiguous precincts in the same municipality that have a combined total of fewer
than 500 registered voters;
    (3) for up to four contiguous municipalities located entirely outside the metropolitan area, as
defined by section 200.02, subdivision 24, that are contained in the same county; or
   (4) for noncontiguous precincts located in one or more counties.
    A copy of the ordinance or resolution establishing a combined polling place must be filed with
the county auditor within 30 days after approval by the governing body. A polling place combined
under clause (3) must be approved by the governing body of each participating municipality.
A polling place combined under clause (4) must be approved by the governing body of each
participating municipality and the secretary of state and may be located outside any of the
noncontiguous precincts. A municipality withdrawing from participation in a combined polling
place must do so by filing a resolution of withdrawal with the county auditor no later than April 1
of any year.

citizen of the United States, has resided in Minnesota for 20 days immediately preceding the election,
maintains residence at the address shown, is not under a guardianship in which the court order
revokes the individual's right to vote, has not been found by a court of law to be legally incompetent
to vote or has the right to vote because, if the individual was convicted of a felony, the felony
sentence has expired or been completed or the individual has been discharged from the sentence,
is registered and has not already voted in the election. The roster must also state: "I understand
that deliberately providing false information is a felony punishable by not more than five years
imprisonment and a fine of not more than $10,000, or both."
   (b) A judge may, before the applicant signs the roster or receipt, confirm the applicant's name,
address, and date of birth.
     (c) In precincts where a paper roster is used, after the applicant signs the roster, the judge shall
give the applicant a voter's receipt. Regardless of the form of roster used, a voter shall deliver the
voter's receipt to the judge in charge of ballots as proof of the voter's right to vote, and thereupon

   Sec. 7. [204E.06] NOTICE.
    Within 24 hours after determining that an automatic recount is required or within 48 hours of
receipt of a written request for a recount and filing of a security deposit if one is required, the official
in charge of the recount shall send notice to the candidates for the office to be recounted and the
county auditor of each county wholly or partially within the election district. The notice must include

summary statements, printouts from voting machines, and precinct incident logs inspected before
the canvassing board may certify the results of the recount.
   Sec. 9. [204E.08] FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT.
    All recounts must be accessible to the public. In a multicounty recount the secretary of state
may locate the recount in one or more of the election jurisdictions or at the site of the canvassing
board. Each election jurisdiction where a recount is conducted shall make available, without charge
to the recount official or body conducting the recount, adequate accessible space and all necessary
equipment and facilities.
   Sec. 10. [204E.09] GENERAL PROCEDURES.
    At the opening of a recount, the recount official or legal adviser shall present the procedures
contained in this section for the recount. The custodian of the ballots shall make available to the
recount official the precinct summary statements, the precinct boxes or the sealed containers of voted
ballots, and any other election materials requested by the recount official. If the recount official needs
to leave the room for any reason, the recount official must designate a deputy recount official to
preside during the recount official's absence. A recount official must be in the room at all times. The
containers of voted ballots must be unsealed and resealed within public view. No ballots or election
materials may be handled by candidates, their representatives, or members of the public. There must
be an area of the room from which the public may observe the recount. Cell phones and video
cameras may be used in this public viewing area, as long as their use is not disruptive. The recount
official shall arrange the counting of the ballots so that the candidates and their representatives may
observe the ballots as they are recounted. Candidates may each have one representative observe the
sorting of each precinct. One additional representative per candidate may observe the ballots when
they have been sorted and are being counted pursuant to section 204E.10. Candidates may have
additional representatives in the public viewing area of the room. If other election materials are
handled or examined by the recount officials, the candidates and their representatives may observe
them. The recount official shall ensure that public observation does not interfere with the counting
of the ballots. The recount official shall prepare a summary of the recount vote by precinct.
   Sec. 11. [204E.10] COUNTING AND CHALLENGING BALLOTS.
    Subdivision 1. Breaks in counting process. Recount officials may not take a break for a meal or
for the day prior to the completion of the sorting, counting, review, and labeling of challenges, and
secure storage of the ballots for any precinct. All challenged ballots must be stored securely during
breaks in the counting process.
    Subd. 2. Sorting ballots. Ballots must be recounted by precinct. The recount official shall open
the sealed container of ballots and recount them in accordance with section 204C.22. The recount
official must review each ballot and sort the ballots into piles based upon the recount official's
determination as to which candidate, if any, the voter intended to vote for: one pile for each candidate
that is the subject of the recount and one pile for all other ballots.
    Subd. 3. Challenge. During the sorting, a candidate or candidate's representative may challenge
the ballot if he or she disagrees with the recount official's determination of for whom the ballot
should be counted and whether there are identifying marks on the ballot. At a recount of a ballot
question, the manner in which a ballot is counted may be challenged by the person who requested
the recount or that person's representative. Challenges may not be automatic or frivolous and the
594                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [27TH DAY

challenger must state the basis for the challenge pursuant to section 204C.22. Challenged ballots
must be placed into separate piles, one for ballots challenged by each candidate. Only the canvassing
board with responsibility to certify the results of the recount has the authority to declare a challenge
to be "frivolous."
    Subd. 4. Counting ballots. Once ballots have been sorted, the recount officials must count
the piles using the stacking method described in section 204C.21. A candidate or candidate's
representative may immediately request to have a pile of 25 counted a second time if there is not
agreement as to the number of votes in the pile.
    Subd. 5. Reviewing and labeling challenged ballots. After the ballots from a precinct have been
counted, the recount official may review the challenged ballots with the candidate or the candidate's
representative. The candidate's representative may choose to withdraw any challenges previously
made. The precinct name, the reason for the challenge, and the name of the person challenging the
ballot or the candidate that person represents, and a sequential number must be marked on the back
of each remaining challenged ballot before it is placed in an envelope marked "Challenged Ballots."
After the count of votes for the precinct has been determined, all ballots except the challenged
ballots must be resealed in the ballot envelopes and returned with the other election materials to
the custodian of the ballots. The recount official may make copies of the challenged ballots. After
the count of votes for all precincts has been determined during that day of counting, the challenged
ballot envelope must be sealed and kept secure for presentation to the canvassing board.
   Sec. 12. [204E.11] RESULTS OF RECOUNT; TIE VOTES.
    Subdivision 1. Certification of results. The recount official shall present the summary statement
of the recount and any challenged ballots to the canvassing board. The candidate or candidate's
representative who made the challenge may present the basis for the challenge to the canvassing
board. The canvassing board shall rule on the challenged ballots and incorporate the results into the
summary statement. The canvassing board shall certify the results of the recount. Challenged ballots
must be returned to the election official who has custody of the ballots.
   Subd. 2. Tie votes. In case of a tie vote for nomination or election to an office, the canvassing
board with the responsibility for declaring the results for that office shall determine the tie by lot.
   Sec. 13. [204E.12] SECURITY DEPOSIT.
    When a bond, cash, or surety for recount expenses is required by section 204E.04 or 204E.05,
the governing body or recount official shall set the amount of the security deposit at an amount
which will cover expected recount expenses. In multicounty districts, the secretary of state shall
set the amount taking into consideration the expenses of the election jurisdictions in the district
and the expenses of the secretary of state. The security deposit must be filed during the period for
requesting an administrative recount. In determining the expenses of the recount, only the actual
recount expenditures incurred by the recount official and the election jurisdiction in conducting the
recount may be included. General office and operating costs may not be taken into account.
   Sec. 14. REVISOR'S INSTRUCTION.
    Except where otherwise amended by this article, the revisor of statutes shall renumber each
section of Minnesota Statutes listed in column A with the number listed in column B. The revisor
shall make necessary cross-reference changes consistent with the renumbering.
