    "(1) [NUMBER OF DISTRICTS.] (a) The Senate must be composed of 67 members. The
House of Representatives must be composed of 134 members. Each district is entitled to elect
a single member. Districts must be numbered in a regular series, beginning with House district
1A in the northwest corner of the state and proceeding across the state from west to east, north
to south, but bypassing the 11-county metropolitan area until the southeast corner has been
reached; then to the 11-county metropolitan area outside the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul;
then in Minneapolis and St. Paul.
   (b) A plan for congressional districts must have eight districts, each entitled to elect a single
member. District numbers must begin with district one in the southeast corner of the state and end
with district eight in the northeast corner of the state.
    (2) [NESTING.] A representative district may not be divided in the formation of a Senate
district.
   (3) [EQUAL POPULATION.] (a) Legislative districts must be substantially equal in
population. The population of a legislative district must not deviate from the ideal by more than
one percent, plus or minus.
   (b) Congressional districts must be as nearly equal in population as practicable.
    (4) [CONTIGUITY; COMPACTNESS.] Districts must be composed of convenient contiguous
territory. To the extent consistent with the other principles in this resolution, districts should be
compact. Contiguity by water is sufficient if the water is not a serious obstacle to travel within
the district. Point contiguity is not sufficient.
    (5) [MINORITY REPRESENTATION.] (a) The dilution of racial or ethnic minority voting
strength is contrary to the laws of the United States and the state of Minnesota. The principles
contained in this resolution must not be construed to supersede any provision of the Voting Rights
Act of 1965, as amended.
    (b) A redistricting plan must not have the intent or effect of dispersing or concentrating
minority population in a manner that prevents minority communities from electing their candidates
of choice.
   (6) [MINOR CIVIL DIVISIONS.] (a) A county, city, or town must not be unduly divided
unless required to meet equal population requirements or to form districts composed of convenient,
contiguous territory.
   (b) A county, city, or town is not unduly divided in the formation of a legislative or
congressional district if:
   (1) the division occurs because a portion of a city or town is noncontiguous with another
portion of the same city or town; or
  (2) despite the division, the known population of any affected county, city, or town remains
wholly located within a single district.
    (7) [PRESERVING COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST.] Districts should attempt to preserve
identifiable communities of interest where that can be done in compliance with the preceding
principles. "Communities of interest" means recognizable areas with similarities of interests

including, but not limited to, racial, ethnic, geographic, social, or cultural interests.
    (8) [DATA TO BE USED.] The geographic areas and population counts used in maps, tables,
and legal descriptions of the districts must be those used by the Geographic Information Services
Office of the Legislative Coordinating Commission. The population counts are the 2010 block
population counts provided to the state under Public Law 94-171, subject to correction of any
errors acknowledged by the United States Census Bureau.
    (9) [CONSIDERATION OF PLANS.] A redistricting plan must not be considered for adoption
by the Senate or House of Representatives until a block equivalency file showing the district to
which each census block has been assigned, in a form prescribed by the director of the Geographic
Information Services Office, has been filed with the director.
    (10) [PRIORITY OF PRINCIPLES.] Where it is not possible to fully comply with the
principles contained in paragraphs (1) to (7), a redistricting plan must give priority to those
principles in the order in which they are listed in this resolution, except to the extent that doing so
would violate federal or state law.
   (11) [EXPIRATION.] This resolution expires June 1, 2012."

this subdivision. The state human services referee shall recommend an order to the commissioner,
who shall, in accordance with the procedure in subdivision 5, issue a final order within 60 days of
the receipt of the request for a hearing, unless the commissioner refuses to accept the recommended
order, in which event a final order shall issue within 90 days of the receipt of that request. The
order may direct the county agency to take those actions necessary to comply with applicable laws
or rules. The commissioner may issue a temporary order prohibiting the demission of a recipient
of case management services from a residential or day habilitation program licensed under chapter
245A, while a county agency review process or an appeal brought by a recipient under this
subdivision is pending, or for the period of time necessary for the county agency to implement
the commissioner's order. The commissioner shall not issue a final order staying the demission of
a recipient of case management services from a residential or day habilitation program licensed
under chapter 245A."

      Senator Hann from the Committee on Health and Human Services, to which was referred
   S.F. No. 477: A bill for an act relating to health; modifying an exemption to the food, beverage,
and lodging establishments statutes; amending Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 157.22.
      Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
      Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
      "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 157.15, subdivision 12b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 12b. School concession stand. "School concession stand" means a food and beverage
service establishment located in a school, on school grounds, or within a school-owned athletic
complex, that is operated in conjunction with school-sponsored events. A school kitchen or school
cafeteria is not a school concession stand.
      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 157.22, is amended to read:
      157.22 EXEMPTIONS.

    Subd. 2. Requirements for electronic prescribing. (a) Effective January 1, 2011, all providers,
group purchasers, prescribers, and dispensers must establish, maintain, and use an electronic
prescription drug program. This program must comply with the applicable standards in this
section for transmitting, directly or through an intermediary, prescriptions and prescription-related
information using electronic media.
    (b) If transactions described in this section are conducted, they must be done electronically using
the standards described in this section. Nothing in this section requires providers, group purchasers,
prescribers, or dispensers to electronically conduct transactions that are expressly prohibited by
other sections or federal law.
    (c) Providers, group purchasers, prescribers, and dispensers must use either HL7 messages
or the NCPDP SCRIPT Standard to transmit prescriptions or prescription-related information
internally when the sender and the recipient are part of the same legal entity. If an entity sends
prescriptions outside the entity, it must use the NCPDP SCRIPT Standard or other applicable
standards required by this section. Any pharmacy within an entity must be able to receive electronic
prescription transmittals from outside the entity using the adopted NCPDP SCRIPT Standard. This
exemption does not supersede any Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
requirement that may require the use of a HIPAA transaction standard within an organization.

    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256.0112, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9. Contracting for performance. In addition to the agreements in subdivision 8, a local
agency may negotiate a supplemental agreement to a contract executed between a lead county and
an approved vendor under subdivision 6 for the purposes of contracting for specific performance.
The supplemental agreement may augment the lead contract requirements and rates for services
authorized by that local agency only. The additional provisions must be negotiated with the
vendor and designed to encourage successful, timely, and cost-effective outcomes for clients, and
may establish incentive payments, penalties, performance-related reporting requirements, and
similar conditions. The per diem rate allowed under this subdivision must not be less than the rate
established in the lead county contract. Nothing in the supplemental agreement between a local
agency and an approved vendor binds the lead county or other local agencies to the terms and the
conditions of the supplemental agreement.

a permitted single family residential use of property for the purposes of zoning, except that a
residential facility whose primary purpose is to treat juveniles who have violated criminal statutes
relating to sex offenses or have been adjudicated delinquent on the basis of conduct in violation of
criminal statutes relating to sex offenses shall not be considered a permitted use.
    (b) A family day care or group family day care facility licensed under Minnesota Rules, parts
9502.0315 to 9502.0445, to serve 14 or fewer children shall be considered a permitted single-family
residential use of property for purposes of zoning and other land use regulations only if the license
holder owns or rents and resides in the home, and is the primary provider of care.
   (c) A municipality may prohibit property zoned as a permitted single-family residential use from
being used as licensed family day care and group family day care when the applicant or license
holder is not the primary provider of care or does not occupy the property as a primary residence.
   Sec. 7. SIMPLIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT PROCESS.
    (a) The commissioner of human services shall issue a request for information for an integrated
service delivery system for health care programs, food support, cash assistance, and child care.
The commissioner shall determine, in consultation with partners in paragraph (c), if the products
meet departments' and counties' functions. The request for information must incorporate a
performance-based vendor financing option in which the vendor shares the risk of the project's
success. The health care system must be developed in phases with the capacity to integrate
food support, cash assistance, and child care programs as funds are available. The request for
information must require that the system:
   (1) streamline eligibility determinations and case processing to support statewide eligibility
processing;
    (2) enable interested persons to determine eligibility for each program, and to apply for programs
online in a manner that the applicant will be asked only those questions relevant to the programs for
which the person is applying;
   (3) leverage technology that has been operational in other state 2.1 environments with similar
requirements; and
    (4) include Web-based application, worker application processing support, and the opportunity
for expansion.
    (b) The commissioner shall issue a final report, including the implementation plan, to the chairs
and ranking minority members of the legislative committees with jurisdiction over health and human
services no later than April 30, 2012.
    (c) The commissioner shall partner with counties, a service delivery authority established
under chapter 402A, the Office of Enterprise Technology, other state agencies, and service partners
to develop an integrated service delivery framework, which will simplify and streamline human
services eligibility and enrollment processes. The primary objectives for the simplification effort
include significantly improved eligibility processing productivity resulting in reduced time for
eligibility determination and enrollment, increased customer service for applicants and recipients
of services, increased program integrity, and greater administrative flexibility.

Minnesota Counties, shall report specific implementation progress to the legislature annually
beginning January 15, 2013.
    (e) The commissioner shall work with the Minnesota Association of County Social Service
Administrators and the Office of Enterprise Technology to develop collaborative task forces, as
necessary, to support implementation of the service delivery components under this paragraph. The
commissioner must develop and include, as part of the integrated eligibility and enrollment service
delivery framework, the following:
   (1) screening tools for applicants to determine potential eligibility as part of an on-line
application process;
    (2) the capacity to use databases to electronically verify application and renewal data as required
by law;
   (3) on-line accounts accessible by applicants and enrollees;
   (4) prepopulated forms;
   (5) an interactive voice response system, available statewide, that provides case information for
applicants, enrollees, and authorized third parties;
   (6) an electronic document management system that provides electronic transfer of all
documents required for eligibility and enrollment processes; and
   (7) a centralized customer contact center that applicants, enrollees, and authorized third parties
can use statewide to receive program information, application assistance, case information, report
changes, to make cost-sharing payments, and conduct other eligibility and enrollment transactions.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

inconsistent with the law, as may be necessary to enable it to carry into effect the provisions of
sections 148.171 to 148.285. The board shall prescribe by rule curricula and standards for schools
and courses preparing persons for licensure under sections 148.171 to 148.285. It shall conduct or
provide for surveys of such schools and courses at such times as it may deem necessary. It shall
approve such schools and courses as meet the requirements of sections 148.171 to 148.285 and
board rules. It shall examine, license, and renew the license of duly qualified applicants. It shall hold
examinations at least once in each year at such time and place as it may determine. It shall by rule
adopt, evaluate, and periodically revise, as necessary, requirements for licensure and for registration
and renewal of registration as defined in section 148.231. It shall maintain a record of all persons
licensed by the board to practice professional or practical nursing and all registered nurses who
hold Minnesota licensure and registration and are certified as advanced practice registered nurses.
It shall cause the prosecution of all persons violating sections 148.171 to 148.285 and have power
to incur such necessary expense therefor. It shall register public health nurses who meet educational
and other requirements established by the board by rule, including payment of a fee. P      ­­r­o

member may administer oaths to witnesses, or take their affirmation. It shall keep a record of all its
proceedings.
    (b) The board shall have access to hospital, nursing home, and other medical records of a patient
cared for by a nurse under review. If the board does not have a written consent from a patient
permitting access to the patient's records, the nurse or facility shall delete any data in the record
that identifies the patient before providing it to the board. The board shall have access to such
other records as reasonably requested by the board to assist the board in its investigation. Nothing
herein may be construed to allow access to any records protected by section 145.64. The board shall
maintain any records obtained pursuant to this paragraph as investigative data under chapter 13.

    Subdivision 1. Licensure by examination. (a) An applicant for a license to practice as a
registered nurse or licensed practical nurse shall apply to the board for a license by examination
on forms prescribed by the board and pay a fee in an amount determined by statute. An applicant
applying for reexamination shall pay a fee in an amount determined by law. In no case may fees
be refunded.
    (b) The applicant must satisfy the following requirements for licensure by examination:
   (1) present evidence the applicant has not engaged in conduct warranting disciplinary action
under section 148.261;
   (2) present evidence of completion of a nursing education program that was conducted in English
and approved by the board, another United States nursing board, or a Canadian province, which
prepared the applicant for the type of license for which the application has been submitted; and
   (3) pass a national nurse licensure written examination. "Written examination" includes paper
and pencil examinations and examinations administered with a computer and related technology
and may include supplemental oral or practical examinations approved by the board.
    (c) An applicant who graduated from an approved nursing education program in Canada and
was licensed in Canada or another United States jurisdiction, without passing the national nurse
licensure examination, must also submit a verification of licensure from the original Canadian
licensure authority and from the United States jurisdiction.
    (d) An applicant who graduated from a nursing program in a country other than the United States

applicant for the type of license for which the application has been submitted and is determined to
be equivalent to the education required in the same type of nursing education programs in the United
States as evaluated by a credentials evaluation service acceptable to the board. The credentials
evaluation service must submit the evaluation and verification directly to the board;
    (2) demonstrate successful completion of coursework to resolve identified nursing education
deficiencies; and
   (3) pass examinations acceptable to the board that test written and spoken English, unless the
applicant graduated from a nursing education program conducted in English and located in an
English-speaking country. The results of the examinations must be submitted directly to the board
from the testing service.
      (e) An applicant failing to pass the examination may apply for reexamination.
    (f) When the applicant has met all requirements stated in this subdivision, the board shall issue a
license to the applicant. The board may issue a license with conditions and limitations if it considers
it necessary to protect the public.
      Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 148.212, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Issuance. Upon receipt of the applicable licensure or reregistration fee and permit
fee, and in accordance with rules of the board, the board may issue a nonrenewable temporary permit
to practice professional or practical nursing to an applicant for licensure or reregistration who is not
the subject of a pending investigation or disciplinary action, nor disqualified for any other reason,
under the following circumstances:

   Sec. 18. [148F.060] VOLUNTARY TERMINATION.
    A license may be voluntarily terminated by the licensee at any time upon written notification
to the board, unless a complaint is pending against the licensee. The notification must be received
by the board prior to termination of the license for failure to renew. A former licensee may be
licensed again only after complying with the relicensure following termination requirements under
section 148F.065. For purposes of this section, the board retains jurisdiction over any licensee whose
license has been voluntarily terminated and against whom the board receives a complaint for conduct
occurring during the period of licensure.
   Sec. 19. [148F.065] RELICENSURE FOLLOWING TERMINATION.
    Subdivision 1. Relicensure. For a period of two years, a former licensee whose license has been
voluntarily terminated or terminated for nonrenewal as provided in section 148F.055, subdivision
2, may be relicensed by completing an application for relicensure, paying the applicable fee, and
verifying that the former licensee has not engaged in the practice of alcohol and drug counseling
in this state since the date of termination. The verification must be accompanied by a notarized
affirmation that the statement is true and correct to the best knowledge and belief of the former
licensee.
    Subd. 2. Continuing education for relicensure. A former licensee seeking relicensure after
license termination must provide evidence of having completed at least 20 hours of continuing
education activities for each year, or portion thereof, that the former licensee did not hold a license.
    Subd. 3. Cancellation of license. The board shall not renew, reissue, reinstate, or restore the
license of a former licensee which was terminated for nonrenewal, or voluntarily terminated, and for
which relicensure was not sought for more than two years from the date the license was terminated
for nonrenewal, or voluntarily terminated. A former licensee seeking relicensure after this two-year
period must obtain a new license by applying for licensure and fulfilling all requirements then in
existence for an initial license to practice alcohol and drug counseling in Minnesota.
   Sec. 20. [148F.070] INACTIVE LICENSE STATUS.
    Subdivision 1. Request for inactive status. Unless a complaint is pending against the licensee,
a licensee whose license is in good standing may request, in writing, that the license be placed on
the inactive list. If a complaint is pending against a licensee, a license may not be placed on the
inactive list until action relating to the complaint is concluded. The board must receive the request
for inactive status before expiration of the license, or the person must pay the late fee. A licensee
may renew a license that is inactive under this subdivision by meeting the renewal requirements of
subdivision 2. A licensee must not practice alcohol and drug counseling while the license is inactive.
    Subd. 2. Renewal of inactive license. A licensee whose license is inactive must renew the
inactive status by the inactive status expiration date determined by the board, or the license will
expire. An application for renewal of inactive status must include evidence satisfactory to the board
that the licensee has completed 40 clock hours of continuing education required in section 148F.075.
Late renewal of inactive status must be accompanied by a late fee as required in section 148F.115,
subdivision 5, paragraph (2).
   Sec. 21. [148F.075] CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS.
1642                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [47TH DAY

    Subdivision 1. Purpose. (a) The purpose of mandatory continuing education is to promote the
professional development of alcohol and drug counselors so that the services they provide promote
the health and well-being of clients who receive services.
   (b) Continued professional growth and maintaining competence in providing alcohol and drug
counseling services are the ethical responsibilities of each licensee.
    Subd. 2. Requirement. Every two years, all licensees must complete a minimum of 40 clock
hours of continuing education activities that meet the requirements in this section. The 40 clock
hours shall include a minimum of nine clock hours on human diversity, and a minimum of three
clock hours on professional ethics. A licensee may be given credit only for activities that directly
relate to the practice of alcohol and drug counseling.
    Subd. 3. Standards for approval. In order to obtain clock hour credit for a continuing education
activity, the activity must:
   (1) constitute an organized program of learning;
   (2) reasonably be expected to advance the knowledge and skills of the alcohol and drug
counselor;
   (3) pertain to subjects that directly relate to the practice of alcohol and drug counseling;
   (4) be conducted by individuals who have education, training, and experience and are
knowledgeable about the subject matter; and
   (5) be presented by a sponsor who has a system to verify participation and maintains attendance
records for three years, unless the sponsor provides dated evidence to each participant with the
number of clock hours awarded.
   Subd. 4. Qualifying activities. Clock hours may be earned through the following:
   (1) attendance at educational programs of annual conferences, lectures, panel discussions,
workshops, in-service training, seminars, and symposia;
    (2) successful completion of college or university courses offered by a regionally accredited
school or education program, if not being taken in order to meet the educational requirements for
licensure under this chapter. The licensee must obtain a grade of at least a "C" or its equivalent or a
pass in a pass/fail course in order to receive the following continuing education credits:
   (i) one semester credit equals 15 clock hours;
   (ii) one trimester credit equals 12 clock hours;
   (iii) one quarter credit equals 10 clock hours;
    (3) successful completion of home study or online courses offered by an accredited school or
education program and that require a licensee to demonstrate knowledge following completion of
the course;
   (4) teaching a course at a regionally accredited institution of higher education. To qualify for
continuing education credit, the course must directly relate to the practice of alcohol and drug
counseling, as determined by the board. Continuing education hours may be earned only for the
47TH DAY]                            TUESDAY, MAY 3, 2011                                        1643

first time the licensee teaches the course. Ten continuing education hours may be earned for each
semester credit hour taught; or
    (5) presentations at workshops, seminars, symposia, meetings of professional organizations,
in-service trainings, or postgraduate institutes. The presentation must be related to alcohol and drug
counseling. A presenter may claim one hour of continuing education for each hour of presentation
time. A presenter may also receive continuing education hours for development time at the rate of
three hours for each hour of presentation time. Continuing education hours may be earned only for
the licensee's first presentation on the subject developed.
    Subd. 5. Activities not qualifying for continuing education clock hours. Approval shall not
be given for courses that do not meet the requirements of this section or are limited to the following:
   (1) any subject contrary to the rules of professional conduct;
   (2) supervision of personnel;
   (3) entertainment or recreational activities;
   (4) employment orientation sessions;
   (5) policy meetings;
   (6) marketing;
   (7) business;
   (8) first aid, CPR, and similar training classes; and
   (9) training related to payment systems, including covered services, coding, and billing.
    Subd. 6. Documentation of reporting compliance. (a) When the licensee applies for renewal of
the license, the licensee must complete and submit an affidavit of continuing education compliance
showing that the licensee has completed a minimum of 40 approved continuing education clock
hours since the last renewal. Failure to submit the affidavit when required makes the licensee's
renewal application incomplete and void.
    (b) All licensees shall retain original documentation of completion of continuing education hours
for a period of five years. For purposes of compliance with this section, a receipt for payment of
the fee for the course is not sufficient evidence of completion of the required hours of continuing
education. Information retained shall include:
   (1) the continuing education activity title;
   (2) a brief description of the continuing education activity;
   (3) the sponsor, presenter, or author;
   (4) the location and the dates attended;
   (5) the number of clock hours; and
   (6) the certificate of attendance, if applicable.
1644                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [47TH DAY

    (c) Only continuing education obtained during the two-year reporting period may be considered
at the time of reporting.
    Subd. 7. Continuing education audit. (a) At the time of renewal, the board may randomly audit
a percentage of its licensees for compliance with continuing education requirements.
   (b) The board shall mail a notice to a licensee selected for an audit of continuing education hours.
The notice must include the reporting periods selected for audit.
   (c) Selected licensees shall submit copies of the original documentation of completed continuing
education hours. Upon specific request, the licensee shall submit original documentation. Failure to
submit required documentation shall result in the renewal application being considered incomplete
and void and constitute grounds for nonrenewal of the license and disciplinary action.
    Subd. 8. Variance of continuing education requirements. (a) If a licensee is unable to meet
the continuing education requirements by the renewal date, the licensee may request a time-limited
variance to fulfill the requirements after the renewal date. A licensee seeking a variance is considered
to be renewing late and is subject to the late renewal fee, regardless of when the request is received
or whether the variance is granted.
    (b) The licensee shall submit the variance request on a form designated by the board, include
the variance fee subject to section 14.056, subdivision 2, and the late fee for license renewal under
section 148F.115. The variance request is subject to the criteria for rule variances in section 14.055,
subdivision 4, and must include a written plan listing the activities offered to meet the requirement.
Hours completed after the renewal date pursuant to the written plan count toward meeting only the
requirements of the previous renewal period.
    (c) A variance granted under this subdivision expires six months after the license renewal date.
A licensee who is granted a variance but fails to complete the required continuing education within
the six-month period may apply for a second variance according to this subdivision.
    (d) If an initial variance request is denied, the license of the licensee shall not be renewed until the
licensee completes the continuing education requirements. If an initial variance is granted, and the
licensee fails to complete the required continuing education within the six-month period, the license
shall be administratively suspended until the licensee completes the required continuing education,
unless the licensee has obtained a second variance according to paragraph (c).
      Sec. 22. [148F.080] SPONSOR'S APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL.
    Subdivision 1. Content. Individuals, organizations, associations, corporations, educational
institutions, or groups intending to offer continuing education activities for approval must submit to

    Subd. 6. Revocation of approval. The board shall revoke its approval of an activity if a sponsor
falsifies information contained in its application for approval, or if a sponsor fails to notify the board
of changes to an approved activity as required in subdivision 4.
   Sec. 23. [148F.085] NONTRANSFERABILITY OF LICENSES.
   An alcohol and drug counselor license is not transferable.
   Sec. 24. [148F.090] DENIAL, SUSPENSION, OR REVOCATION OF LICENSE.
    Subdivision 1. Grounds. The board may impose disciplinary action as described in subdivision
2 against an applicant or licensee whom the board, by a preponderance of the evidence, determines:
   (1) has violated a statute, rule, or order that the board issued or is empowered to enforce;
    (2) has engaged in fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest conduct, whether or not the conduct relates
to the practice of licensed alcohol and drug counseling that adversely affects the person's ability or
fitness to practice alcohol and drug counseling;
   (3) has engaged in unprofessional conduct or any other conduct which has the potential for
1646                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [47TH DAY

causing harm to the public, including any departure from or failure to conform to the minimum
standards of acceptable and prevailing practice without actual injury having to be established;
   (4) has been convicted of or has pled guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or other crime, an
element of which is dishonesty or fraud, or has been shown to have engaged in acts or practices
tending to show that the applicant or licensee is incompetent or has engaged in conduct reflecting
adversely on the applicant's or licensee's ability or fitness to engage in the practice of alcohol and
drug counseling;
   (5) has employed fraud or deception in obtaining or renewing a license, or in passing an
examination;
    (6) has had any license, certificate, registration, privilege to take an examination, or other similar
authority denied, revoked, suspended, canceled, limited, or not renewed for cause in any jurisdiction
or has surrendered or voluntarily terminated a license or certificate during a board investigation of
a complaint, as part of a disciplinary order, or while under a disciplinary order;
   (7) has failed to meet any requirement for the issuance or renewal of the person's license. The
burden of proof is on the applicant or licensee to demonstrate the qualifications or satisfy the
requirements for a license under chapter 148F;
   (8) has failed to cooperate with an investigation by the board;
    (9) has demonstrated an inability to practice alcohol and drug counseling with reasonable skill
and safety as a result of illness, use of alcohol, drugs, chemicals, or any other materials, or as a result
of any mental, physical, or psychological condition;
    (10) has engaged in conduct with a client that is sexual or may reasonably be interpreted by the
client as sexual, or in any verbal behavior that is seductive or sexually demeaning to a client;
    (11) has been subject to a corrective action or similar, nondisciplinary action in another
jurisdiction or by another regulatory authority;
    (12) has been adjudicated as mentally incompetent, mentally ill, or developmentally disabled or
as a chemically dependent person, a person dangerous to the public, a sexually dangerous person,
or a person who has a sexual psychopathic personality by a court of competent jurisdiction within
this state or an equivalent adjudication from another state. Adjudication automatically suspends a
license for the duration thereof unless the board orders otherwise;
   (13) fails to comply with a client's request for health records made under sections 144.291 to
144.298, or to furnish a client record or report required by law;
  (14) has engaged in abusive or fraudulent billing practices, including violations of the federal
Medicare and Medicaid laws or state medical assistance laws; or
    (15) has engaged in fee splitting. This clause does not apply to the distribution of revenues
from a partnership, group practice, nonprofit corporation, or professional corporation to its partners,
shareholders, members, or employees if the revenues consist only of fees for services performed by
the licensee or under a licensee's administrative authority. Fee splitting includes, but is not limited
to:
   (i) dividing fees with another person or a professional corporation, unless the division is in
47TH DAY]                            TUESDAY, MAY 3, 2011                                        1647

proportion to the services provided and the responsibility assumed by each professional;
   (ii) referring a client to any health care provider as defined in sections 144.291 to 144.298 in
which the referring licensee has a significant financial interest, unless the licensee has disclosed in
advance to the client the licensee's own financial interest; or
   (iii) paying, offering to pay, receiving, or agreeing to receive a commission, rebate, or
remuneration, directly or indirectly, primarily for the referral of clients.
    Subd. 2. Forms of disciplinary action. If grounds for disciplinary action exist under subdivision
1, the board may take one or more of the following actions;
   (1) refuse to grant or renew a license;
   (2) revoke a license;
   (3) suspend a license;
    (4) impose limitations or conditions on a licensee's practice of alcohol and drug counseling,
including, but not limited to, limiting the scope of practice to designated competencies, imposing
retraining or rehabilitation requirements, requiring the licensee to practice under supervision,
or conditioning continued practice on the demonstration of knowledge or skill by appropriate
examination or other review of skill and competence;
   (5) censure or reprimand the licensee;
    (6) impose a civil penalty not exceeding $10,000 for each separate violation, the amount of the
civil penalty to be fixed so as to deprive the applicant or licensee of any economic advantage gained
by reason of the violation charged, to discourage similar violations or to reimburse the board for
the cost of the investigation and proceeding, including, but not limited to, fees paid for services
provided by the Office of Administrative Hearings, legal and investigative services provided by the
Office of the Attorney General, court reporters, witnesses, reproduction of records, board members'
per diem compensation, board staff time, and travel costs and expenses incurred by board staff and
board members; or
   (7) any other action justified by the case.
    Subd. 3. Evidence. In disciplinary actions alleging violations of subdivision 1, clause (4), (12),
or (14), a copy of the judgment or proceedings under the seal of the court administrator or of the
administrative agency that entered the judgment or proceeding is admissible into evidence without
further authentication and constitutes prima facie evidence of its contents.
    Subd. 4. Temporary suspension. (a) In addition to any other remedy provided by law, the board
may issue an order to temporarily suspend the credentials of a licensee after conducting a preliminary
inquiry to determine if the board reasonably believes that the licensee has violated a statute or rule
that the board is empowered to enforce and whether continued practice by the licensee would create
an imminent risk of harm to others.
   (b) The order may prohibit the licensee from engaging in the practice of alcohol and drug
counseling in whole or in part and may condition the end of a suspension on the licensee's
compliance with a statute, rule, or order that the board has issued or is empowered to enforce.
1648                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [47TH DAY

    (c) The order shall give notice of the right to a hearing according to this subdivision and shall
state the reasons for the entry of the order.
    (d) Service of the order is effective when the order is served on the licensee personally or by
certified mail, which is complete upon receipt, refusal, or return for nondelivery to the most recent
address of the licensee provided to the board.
    (e) At the time the board issues a temporary suspension order, the board shall schedule a hearing
to be held before its own members. The hearing shall begin no later than 60 days after issuance of the
temporary suspension order or within 15 working days of the date of the board's receipt of a request
for hearing by a licensee, on the sole issue of whether there is a reasonable basis to continue, modify,
or lift the temporary suspension. The hearing is not subject to chapter 14. Evidence presented by the
board or the licensee shall be in affidavit form only. The licensee or counsel of record may appear
for oral argument.
    (f) Within five working days of the hearing, the board shall issue its order and, if the suspension
is continued, schedule a contested case hearing within 30 days of the issuance of the order.
Notwithstanding chapter 14, the administrative law judge shall issue a report within 30 days after
closing the contested case hearing record. The board shall issue a final order within 30 days of
receipt of the administrative law judge's report.
   Subd. 5. Automatic suspension. (a) The right to practice is automatically suspended when:
    (1) a guardian of an alcohol and drug counselor is appointed by order of a district court under
sections 524.5-101 to 524.5-502; or
   (2) the counselor is committed by order of a district court under chapter 253B.
   (b) The right to practice remains suspended until the counselor is restored to capacity by a court
and, upon petition by the counselor, the suspension is terminated by the board after a hearing or
upon agreement between the board and the counselor.
    Subd. 6. Mental, physical, or chemical health evaluation. (a) If the board has probable cause
to believe that an applicant or licensee is unable to practice alcohol and drug counseling with
reasonable skill and safety due to a mental or physical illness or condition, the board may direct the
individual to submit to a mental, physical, or chemical dependency examination or evaluation.
    (1) For the purposes of this section, every licensee and applicant is deemed to have consented
to submit to a mental, physical, or chemical dependency examination or evaluation when directed
in writing by the board and to have waived all objections to the admissibility of the examining
professionals' testimony or examination reports on the grounds that the testimony or examination
reports constitute a privileged communication.
    (2) Failure of a licensee or applicant to submit to an examination when directed by the board
constitutes an admission of the allegations against the person, unless the failure was due to
circumstances beyond the person's control, in which case a default and final order may be entered
without the taking of testimony or presentation of evidence.
    (3) A licensee or applicant affected under this subdivision shall at reasonable intervals be given
an opportunity to demonstrate that the licensee or applicant can resume the competent practice of
licensed alcohol and drug counseling with reasonable skill and safety to the public.
47TH DAY]                              TUESDAY, MAY 3, 2011                                           1649

    (4) In any proceeding under this subdivision, neither the record of proceedings nor the orders
entered by the board shall be used against the licensee or applicant in any other proceeding.
    (b) In addition to ordering a physical or mental examination, the board may, notwithstanding
section 13.384 or 144.651, or any other law limiting access to medical or other health data, obtain
medical data and health records relating to a licensee or applicant without the licensee's or applicant's
consent if the board has probable cause to believe that subdivision 1, clause (9), applies to the
licensee or applicant. The medical data may be requested from:
   (1) a provider, as defined in section 144.291, subdivision 2, paragraph (h);
   (2) an insurance company; or
   (3) a government agency, including the Department of Human Services.
    (c) A provider, insurance company, or government agency must comply with any written request
of the board under this subdivision and is not liable in any action for damages for releasing the data
requested by the board if the data are released pursuant to a written request under this subdivision,
unless the information is false and the provider giving the information knew, or had reason to believe,
the information was false.
   (d) Information obtained under this subdivision is classified as private under sections 13.01 to
13.87.
   Sec. 25. [148F.095] ADDITIONAL REMEDIES.
    Subdivision 1. Cease and desist. (a) The board may issue a cease and desist order to stop a
person from violating or threatening to violate a statute, rule, or order which the board has issued or
has authority to enforce. The cease and desist order must state the reason for its issuance and give
notice of the person's right to request a hearing under sections 14.57 to 14.62. If, within 15 days of
service of the order, the subject of the order fails to request a hearing in writing, the order is the final
order of the board and is not reviewable by a court or agency.
    (b) A hearing must be initiated by the board not later than 30 days from the date of the board's
receipt of a written hearing request. Within 30 days of receipt of the administrative law judge's
report, and any written agreement or exceptions filed by the parties, the board shall issue a final
order modifying, vacating, or making permanent the cease and desist order as the facts require. The
final order remains in effect until modified or vacated by the board.
    (c) When a request for a stay accompanies a timely hearing request, the board may, in the board's
discretion, grant the stay. If the board does not grant a requested stay, the board shall refer the
request to the Office of Administrative Hearings within three working days of receipt of the request.
Within ten days after receiving the request from the board, an administrative law judge shall issue a
recommendation to grant or deny the stay. The board shall grant or deny the stay within five working
days of receiving the administrative law judge's recommendation.
   (d) In the event of noncompliance with a cease and desist order, the board may institute a
proceeding in district court to obtain injunctive relief or other appropriate relief, including a civil
penalty payable to the board, not to exceed $10,000 for each separate violation.
   Subd. 2. Injunctive relief. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, including the
1650                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [47TH DAY

issuance of a cease and desist order under subdivision 1, the board may in the board's own name
bring an action in district court for injunctive relief to restrain an alcohol and drug counselor from
a violation or threatened violation of any statute, rule, or order which the board has authority to
administer, enforce, or issue.
    Subd. 3. Additional powers. The issuance of a cease and desist order or injunctive relief granted
under this section does not relieve a counselor from criminal prosecution by a competent authority
or from disciplinary action by the board.
   Sec. 26. [148F.100] COOPERATION.
    An alcohol and drug counselor who is the subject of an investigation, or who is questioned
in connection with an investigation, by or on behalf of the board, shall cooperate fully with the
investigation. Cooperation includes responding fully to any question raised by or on behalf of the
board relating to the subject of the investigation, whether tape recorded or not. Challenges to requests
of the board may be brought before the appropriate agency or court.
   Sec. 27. [148F.105] PROHIBITED PRACTICE OR USE OF TITLES; PENALTY.
    Subdivision 1. Practice. No person shall engage in alcohol and drug counseling without first
being licensed under this chapter as an alcohol and drug counselor. For purposes of this chapter,
an individual engages in the practice of alcohol and drug counseling if the individual performs or
offers to perform alcohol and drug counseling services as defined in section 148F.010, subdivision
19, or if the individual is held out as able to perform those services.
    Subd. 2. Use of titles. (a) No individual shall present themselves or any other individual to the
public by any title incorporating the words "licensed alcohol and drug counselor," "alcohol and
drug counselor," or otherwise hold themselves out to the public by any title or description stating
or implying that they are licensed or otherwise qualified to practice alcohol and drug counseling,
unless that individual holds a valid license.
   (b) An individual issued a temporary permit must use titles consistent with section 148F.035,
subdivisions 1 and 2, paragraph (c), clause (3).
    (c) An individual who is participating in an alcohol and drug counseling practicum for purposes
of licensure by the board may be designated an "alcohol and drug counselor intern."
    (d) Individuals who are trained in alcohol and drug counseling and employed by an educational
institution recognized by a regional accrediting organization, by a federal, state, county, or local
government institution, by agencies, or research facilities, may represent themselves by the titles
designated by that organization provided the title does not indicate the individual is licensed by the
board.

competence in a service, method, procedure, or to treat a specific client population, the alcohol and

supervision, or experience, or a combination thereof, necessary to demonstrate competence.
    Subd. 3. Experimental, emerging, or innovative services. Alcohol and drug counselors may
offer experimental services, methods, or procedures competently and in a manner that protects
clients from harm. However, when doing so, they have a heightened responsibility to understand
and communicate the potential risks to clients, to use reasonable skill and safety, and to undertake
appropriate preparation as required in subdivision 2.
    Subd. 4. Limitations. Alcohol and drug counselors shall recognize the limitations to the scope
of practice of alcohol and drug counseling. When the needs of clients appear to be outside their

resources when it is in the best interests of clients to be provided with alternative or complementary

   Sec. 32. [148F.130] PROTECTING CLIENT PRIVACY.
    Subdivision 1. Protecting private information. The provider shall safeguard private

the consent of the client when a duty to warn arises, or as otherwise provided by law or court order.
The duty to warn of, or take reasonable precautions to provide protection from, violent behavior
arises only when a client or other person has communicated to the provider a specific, serious threat
of physical violence to self or a specific, clearly identified or identifiable potential victim. If a duty
to warn arises, the duty is discharged by the provider if reasonable efforts are made to communicate
the threat to law enforcement agencies, the potential victim, the family of the client, or appropriate
third parties who are in a position to prevent or avert the harm. No monetary liability and no cause of
action or disciplinary action by the board may arise against a provider for disclosure of confidences
to third parties, for failure to disclose confidences to third parties, or for erroneous disclosure of
confidences to third parties in a good faith effort to warn against or take precautions against a client's
violent behavior or threat of suicide.
    Subd. 3. Services to group clients. Whenever alcohol and drug counseling services are provided
to group clients, the provider shall initially inform each client of the provider's responsibility and
each client's individual responsibility to treat any information gained in the course of rendering the
services as private information, including any limitations to each client's right to privacy.
    Subd. 4. Obtaining collateral information. Prior to obtaining collateral information about a
client from other individuals, the provider shall obtain consent from the client unless the consent
is not required by law or court order, and shall inform the other individuals that the information
obtained may become part of the client's records and may therefore be accessed or released by
1654                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [47TH DAY

the client, unless prohibited by law. For purposes of this subdivision, "other individual" means
any individual, except for credentialed health care providers acting in their professional capacities,
who participates adjunctively in the provision of services to a client. Examples of other individuals
include, but are not limited to, family members, friends, coworkers, day care workers, guardian ad
litems, foster parents, or school personnel.
    Subd. 5. Minor clients. At the beginning of a professional relationship, the provider shall inform
a minor client that the law imposes limitations on the right of privacy of the minor with respect to
the minor's communications with the provider. This requirement is waived when the minor cannot
reasonably be expected to understand the privacy statement.
    Subd. 6. Limited access to client records. The provider shall limit access to client records.
The provider shall make reasonable efforts to inform individuals associated with the provider's
agency or facility, such as staff members, students, volunteers, or community aides, that access
to client records, regardless of their format, is limited only to the provider with whom the client has
a professional relationship, an individual associated with the agency or facility whose duties require
access, or individuals authorized to have access by the written informed consent of the client.
    Subd. 7. Billing statements for services. The provider shall comply with the privacy wishes of
clients regarding to whom and where statements for services are to be sent.
   Subd. 8. Case reports. The identification of the client shall be reasonably disguised in case
reports or other clinical materials used in teaching, presentations, professional meetings, or
publications.
  Subd. 9. Observation and recording. Diagnostic interviews or therapeutic sessions with a client
may be observed or electronically recorded only with the client's written informed consent.
    Subd. 10. Continued protection of client information. The provider shall maintain the privacy
of client data indefinitely after the professional relationship has ended.
    Subd. 11. Court-ordered or other mandated disclosures. The proper disclosure of private
client data upon a court order or to conform with state or federal law shall not be considered a
violation of sections 148F.120 to 148F.205.
   Subd. 12. Abuse or neglect of minor or vulnerable adults. An applicant or licensee must
comply with the reporting of maltreatment of minors established in section 626.556 and the reporting
of maltreatment of vulnerable adults established in section 626.557.
    Subd. 13. Initial contacts. When an individual initially contacts a provider regarding alcohol
and drug counseling services, the provider or another individual designated by the provider may,
with oral consent from the potential client, contact third parties to determine payment or benefits
information, arrange for precertification of services when required by the individual's health plan,
or acknowledge a referral from another health care professional.
   Sec. 33. [148F.135] PRIVATE INFORMATION; ACCESS AND RELEASE.

in the records that has not been provided directly or by authorization of the requesting client must be
redacted unless written authorization to disclose this information has been obtained from the other
clients.
    Subd. 4. Board investigation. The board shall be allowed access to any records of a client
provided services by an applicant or licensee who is under investigation. If the client has not signed
a consent permitting access to the client's records, the applicant or licensee must delete any data
that identifies the client before providing them to the board. The board shall maintain any records
as investigative data pursuant to chapter 13.
   Sec. 34. [148F.140] INFORMED CONSENT.
1656                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [47TH DAY

education, training, continuing education, consultation, psychotherapy, intervention, supervision,
or discussion with the client or potential client, or an appropriate combination thereof.

   Sec. 41. [148F.175] MEDICAL AND OTHER HEALTH CARE CONSIDERATIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Coordinating services with other health care professionals. Upon initiating
services, the provider shall inquire whether the client has a preexisting relationship with another
health care professional. If the client has such a relationship, and it is relevant to the provider's
services to the client, the provider shall, to the extent possible and consistent with the wishes and
best interests of the client, coordinate services for the client with the other health care professional.
This requirement does not apply if brief crisis intervention services are provided.
    Subd. 2. Reviewing health care information. If the provider determines that a client's
preexisting relationship with another health care professional is relevant to the provider's services
to the client, the provider shall, to the extent possible and consistent with the wishes and best
interests of the client, review this information with the treating health care professional.
    Subd. 3. Relevant medical conditions. If the provider believes that a client's psychological
condition may have medical etiology or consequence, the provider shall, within the limits of the
provider's competence, discuss this with the client and offer to assist in identifying medical resources
for the client.
   Sec. 42. [148F.180] ASSESSMENTS; TESTS; REPORTS.
    Subdivision 1. Assessments. Providers who conduct assessments of individuals shall base their
assessments on records, information, observations, and techniques sufficient to substantiate their
findings. They shall render opinions only after they have conducted an examination of the individual
adequate to support their statements or conclusions, unless an examination is not practical despite
reasonable efforts. An assessment may be limited to reviewing records or providing testing services
when an individual examination is not necessary for the opinion requested.
    Subd. 2. Tests. Providers may administer and interpret tests within the scope of the counselor's
training, skill, and competence.
    Subd. 3. Reports. Written and oral reports, including testimony as an expert witness and letters

reviewed, which serve as a basis for the provider's conclusions;
   (2) reservations or qualifications concerning the validity or reliability of the opinions and
conclusions formulated and recommendations made;

information regarding the circumstances of the case that may have a bearing on the provider's
conclusions;

   (4) a statement of the nature of and reason for the use of a test that is administered, recorded,
scored, or interpreted in other than a standard and objective manner; and
   (5) a statement indicating when test interpretations or report conclusions are not based on direct
contact between the client and the provider.
    Subd. 4. Private information. Test results and interpretations regarding an individual are private
information.
   Sec. 43. [148F.185] PUBLIC STATEMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Prohibition against false or misleading information. Public statements by
providers must not include false or misleading information. Providers shall not solicit or use

to undue influence. The provider shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that public statements by
others on behalf of the provider are truthful and shall make reasonable remedial efforts to bring a
public statement into compliance with sections 148F.120 to 148F.205 when the provider becomes
aware of a violation.
    Subd. 2. Misrepresentation. The provider shall not misrepresent directly or by implication
professional qualifications including education, training, experience, competence, credentials, or
areas of specialization. The provider shall not misrepresent, directly or by implication, professional
affiliations or the purposes and characteristics of institutions and organizations with which the
provider is professionally associated.
    Subd. 3. Use of specialty board designation. Providers may represent themselves as having an

   (2) specified experience requirements defined by the specialty board;
   (3) a work product evaluated by other specialty board members; and

or a third party is billed and make the itemized statement available to the client. The statement shall
identify the date the service was provided, the nature of the service, the name of the individual
who provided the service, and the name of the individual who is professionally responsible for the
service.

provider is either the direct provider of the services or is clinically responsible for providing the
services and under whose supervision the services were provided.
    Subd. 5. Referrals. No commission, rebate, or other form of remuneration may be given or
received by a provider for the referral of clients for counseling services.
   Sec. 45. [148F.195] AIDING AND ABETTING UNLICENSED PRACTICE.
    A provider shall not aid or abet an unlicensed individual to engage in the practice of alcohol
and drug counseling. A provider who supervises a student as part of an alcohol and drug counseling
practicum is not in violation of this section. Properly qualified individuals who administer and score
testing instruments under the direction of a provider who maintains responsibility for the service are
not considered in violation of this section.
   Sec. 46. [148F.200] VIOLATION OF LAW.
    A provider shall not violate any law in which the facts giving rise to the violation involve the
practice of alcohol and drug counseling as defined in sections 148F.001 to 148F.205. In any board
proceeding alleging a violation of this section, the proof of a conviction of a crime constitutes proof
of the underlying factual elements necessary to that conviction.

   Subdivision 1. Mandatory reporting requirements. A provider is required to file a complaint
when the provider knows or has reason to believe that another provider:

or condition, including, but not limited to, substance abuse or dependence, except that this mandated
reporting requirement is deemed fulfilled by a report made to the Health Professionals Services

    (2) is engaging in or has engaged in sexual behavior with a client or former client in violation
of section 148F.165, subdivision 6 or 7;

626.556 or 626.557; or
    (4) has employed fraud or deception in obtaining or renewing an alcohol and drug counseling

    Subd. 2. Optional reporting requirements. Other than conduct listed in subdivision 1, a
provider who has reason to believe that the conduct of another provider appears to be in violation
of sections 148F.001 to 148F.205 may file a complaint with the board.
    Subd. 3. Institutions. A state agency, political subdivision, agency of a local unit of
government, private agency, hospital, clinic, prepaid medical plan, or other health care institution

institution, or organization or any of its administrators or medical or other committees to revoke,
suspend, restrict, or condition an alcohol and drug counselor's privilege to practice or treat patients
or clients in the institution, or as part of the organization, any denial of privileges, or any other
disciplinary action for conduct that might constitute grounds for disciplinary action by the board
1664                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [47TH DAY

under sections 148F.001 to 148F.205. The institution, organization, or governmental entity shall
also report the resignation of any alcohol and drug counselors before the conclusion of any
disciplinary action proceeding for conduct that might constitute grounds for disciplinary action
under this chapter, or before the commencement of formal charges but after the practitioner had
knowledge that formal charges were contemplated or were being prepared.
    Subd. 4. Professional societies. A state or local professional society for alcohol and drug
counselors shall report to the board any termination, revocation, or suspension of membership
or any other disciplinary action taken against an alcohol and drug counselor. If the society has
received a complaint that might be grounds for discipline under this chapter against a member on
which it has not taken any disciplinary action, the society shall report the complaint and the reason
why it has not taken action on it or shall direct the complainant to the board.
    Subd. 5. Insurers. Each insurer authorized to sell insurance described in section 60A.06,
subdivision 1, clause (13), and providing professional liability insurance to alcohol and drug
counselors or the Medical Joint Underwriting Association under chapter 62F, shall submit to the
board quarterly reports concerning the alcohol and drug counselors against whom malpractice
settlements and awards have been made. The report must contain at least the following information:

a settlement was made. The insurance company shall, in addition to the above information, submit
to the board any information, records, and files, including clients' charts and records, it possesses
that tend to substantiate a charge that a licensed alcohol and drug counselor may have engaged in
conduct violating this chapter.
    Subd. 6. Self-reporting. An alcohol and drug counselor shall report to the board any personal
action that would require that a report be filed with the board by any person, health care facility,
business, or organization under subdivisions 1 and 3 to 5. The alcohol and drug counselor shall also
report the revocation, suspension, restriction, limitation, or other disciplinary action in this state and
report the filing of charges regarding the practitioner's license or right of practice in another state or
jurisdiction.
   Subd. 7. Permission to report. A person who has knowledge of any conduct constituting
grounds for disciplinary action relating to the practice of alcohol and drug counseling under this
chapter may report the violation to the board.
     Subd. 8. Client complaints to the board. A provider shall, upon request, provide information
regarding the procedure for filing a complaint with the board and shall, upon request, assist with
filing a complaint. A provider shall not attempt to dissuade a client from filing a complaint with the
board, or require that the client waive the right to file a complaint with the board as a condition for

    (d) The owner, driver, or user of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer, upon conviction
for transporting a gross weight in excess of the gross weight for which it was registered or for
operating a vehicle with an axle weight exceeding the maximum lawful axle load weight, is guilty
of a misdemeanor and subject to increased registration or reregistration according to the following

schedule:
    (1) Upon conviction for transporting a gross weight in excess of the gross weight for which a
motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer is registered by more than the allowance set forth in paragraph
(b) but less than 25 percent, or for operating or using a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer with an
axle weight exceeding the maximum lawful axle load as provided in sections 169.822 to 169.829
by more than the allowance set forth in paragraph (b) but less than 25 percent, the owner, driver,
or user of the motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer used to commit the violation, in addition to any
penalty imposed for the misdemeanor, shall apply to the registrar to increase the authorized gross
weight to be carried on the vehicle to a weight equal to or greater than the gross weight the owner,
driver, or user was convicted of carrying. The increase is computed for the balance of the calendar
year on the basis of 1/12 of the annual tax for each month remaining in the calendar year beginning
with the first day of the month in which the violation occurred. If the additional registration tax
computed upon that weight, plus the tax already paid, amounts to more than the regular tax for the
maximum gross weight permitted for the vehicle under sections 169.822 to 169.829, that additional
amount must nevertheless be paid into the highway fund, but the additional tax thus paid does not
authorize or permit any person to operate the vehicle with a gross weight in excess of the maximum
legal weight as provided by sections 169.822 to 169.829. Unless the owner within 30 days after
a conviction applies to increase the authorized weight and pays the additional tax as provided in
this section, the registrar shall revoke the registration on the vehicle and demand the return of the
registration card and plates issued on that registration.
    (2) Upon conviction of an owner, driver, or user of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer for
transporting a gross weight in excess of the gross weight for which the motor vehicle, trailer, or
semitrailer was registered by 25 percent or more or for operating or using the vehicle or trailer
with an axle weight exceeding the maximum lawful axle load as provided in sections 169.822 to
169.829 by 25 percent or more, and in addition to any penalty imposed for the misdemeanor, the
registrar shall either (i) cancel the reciprocity privileges on the vehicle involved if the vehicle is
being operated under reciprocity or (ii) if the vehicle is not being operated under reciprocity, cancel
the certificate of registration on the vehicle operated and demand the return of the registration
certificate and registration plates. The registrar may not cancel the registration or reciprocity
privileges for any vehicle found in violation of seasonal load restrictions imposed under section
169.87 unless the axle weight exceeds the year-round weight limit for the highway on which the
violation occurred. The registrar may investigate any allegation of gross weight violations and
demand that the operator show cause why all future operating privileges in the state should not be
revoked unless the additional tax assessed is paid.
    (3) Clause (1) does not apply to the first haul of unprocessed or raw farm products or unfinished
forest products, when the registered gross weight is not exceeded by more than ten percent. For
purposes of this clause, "first haul" means (i) the first, continuous transportation of unprocessed or
raw farm products from the place of production or on-farm storage site to any other location within
50 miles of the place of production or on-farm storage site, or (ii) the continuous or noncontinuous
transportation of unfinished forest products from the place of production to the place of final
processing or manufacture located within 200 miles of the place of production.
    (4) When the registration on a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer is revoked by the registrar
according to this section, the vehicle must not be operated on the highways of the state until it is
registered or reregistered, as the case may be, and new plates issued, and the registration fee is the

annual tax for the total gross weight of the vehicle at the time of violation. The reregistration pursuant
to this subdivision of any vehicle operating under reciprocity agreements pursuant to section 168.181
or 168.187 must be at the full annual registration fee without regard to the percentage of vehicle
miles traveled in this state.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2012, and applies to all registrations
that are effective on and after that date and special permits issued on and after that date.
     Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 168.013, subdivision 12, is amended to read:
      Subd. 12. Additional tax for excessive gross weight. (a) Whenever an owner has registered a
vehicle and paid the tax as provided in subdivisions 1 to 1g, on the basis of a selected gross weight
of the vehicle and thereafter such owner desires to operate such vehicle with a greater gross weight
than that for which the tax has been paid, such owner shall be permitted to reregister such vehicle by
paying the additional tax due thereon for the remainder of the calendar year for which such vehicle
has been reregistered, the additional tax computed pro rata by the month, 1/12 of the annual tax
due for each month of the year remaining in the calendar year, beginning with the first day of the
month in which such owner desires to operate the vehicle with the greater weight. In computing
the additional tax as aforesaid, the owner shall be given credit for the unused portion of the tax
previously paid computed pro rata by the month, 1/12 of the annual tax paid for each month of the
year remaining in the calendar year beginning with the first day of the month in which such owner
desires to operate the vehicle with the greater weight. An owner will be permitted one reduction of
gross weight or change of registration per year, which will result in a refund. This refund will be
prorated monthly beginning with the first day of the month after such owner applies to amend the
registration. The application for amendment shall be accompanied by a fee of $3, and all fees shall
be deposited in the highway user tax distribution fund. P                           ­­

     (1) the application is an original rather than renewal application; or
    (2) the applicant is a licensed motor vehicle lessor under section 168.27 and the vehicle is leased
or rented for periods of time of not more than 28 days, in which case the applicant may apply
for initial or renewed registration of a vehicle for a period of four or more months, the month of
expiration to be designated by the applicant at the time of registration. H                     ­o­w­­ev

exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in
combination, only the colors Green, Red, and Yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian
signals carrying a word or legend. The traffic-control signal lights or colored lighted arrows
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
   (1) Green indication:
     (i) Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or
left unless a sign ­

right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time this signal is exhibited. Vehicular traffic turning left
or making a U-turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard.
    (ii) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow,
or other movement as permitted by other indications shown at the same time. S ­u­­
                                                                                 ch

shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic
lawfully using the intersection.
    (iii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in subdivision 6,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed
across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. Every driver of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to such pedestrian, except that the pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the green signal indication is first shown.
   (2) Steady yellow indication:
    (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that
the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic must not enter the intersection, except for the continued movement
allowed by any green arrow indication simultaneously exhibited.

    (ii) Pedestrians facing a circular yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control
signal as provided in subdivision 6, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the
roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.
   (3) Steady red indication:
     (i) Vehicular traffic facing a circular red signal alone must stop at a clearly marked stop line
but, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then
before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown, except
as follows: (A) the driver of a vehicle stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection in obedience
to a red or stop signal, and with the intention of making a right turn may make the right turn, after
stopping, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting such movement, but shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by the signal at that
intersection; or (B) the driver of a vehicle on a one-way street intersecting another one-way street
on which traffic moves to the left shall stop in obedience to a red or stop signal and may then make a
left turn into the one-way street, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting the movement,
but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by
the signal at that intersection.
   (ii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in subdivision 6,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
    (iii) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal, with the intention of making a movement
indicated by the arrow, must stop at a clearly marked stop line but, if none, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and
must remain standing until a permissive signal indication permitting the movement indicated by the
red arrow is displayed, except as follows: when an official sign has been erected permitting a turn
on a red arrow signal, the vehicular traffic facing a red arrow signal indication is permitted to enter
the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street on which
traffic moves to the left, after stopping, but must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other
traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by the signal at that intersection.
    (b) In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this section are applicable except those which can have no application.
Any stop required must be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop
must be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop must be made at the signal.
    (c) When a traffic-control signal indication or indications placed to control a certain movement
or lane are so identified by placing a sign near the indication or indications, no other traffic-control
signal indication or indications within the intersection controls vehicular traffic for that movement
or lane.
   Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.06, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7. Flashing signal. When flashing red or yellow signals are used they shall require

has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection, and
the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
    (b) When a red arrow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes drivers of vehicles with
the intention of making a movement indicated by the arrow shall stop at a clearly marked stop line,
but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at
the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the
rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
    (c) When a circular yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of
vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past the signals only with caution. But vehicular
traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and
to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time this signal is
exhibited. Vehicular traffic turning left or making a U-turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way
to other vehicles approaching from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate
hazard.
    (d) When a yellow arrow indication is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of
vehicles with the intention of making a movement indicated by the arrow may proceed through the
intersection or past the signals only with caution.

   Subd. 5. Other operation requirements and prohibitions. (a) A person operating a motorized
bicycle on a roadway shall ride as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway
except in one of the following situations:
   (1) when overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction;
   (2) when preparing for a left turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway; or
    (3) when reasonably necessary to avoid conditions, including fixed or moving objects, vehicles,
pedestrians, animals, surface hazards, or narrow width lanes, that make it unsafe to continue along
the right-hand curb or edge.
   (b) Persons operating motorized bicycles on a roadway may not ride more than two abreast
and may not impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic. On a laned roadway, a person
operating a motorized bicycle shall ride within a single lane.
    (c) This section does not permit the operation of a motorized bicycle on a bicycle path or bicycle
lane that is reserved for the exclusive use of nonmotorized traffic, except that an electric-assisted
bicycle may be operated on the path or lane if authorized under section 85.015, subdivision 1d;
85.018, subdivision 2, paragraph (d); or 160.263, subdivision 2, paragraph (b), as applicable.

   (e) This section does not apply to the operation of buses on dynamic shoulder lanes.
    (f) The commissioner may authorize different operating conditions and maximum speeds, not
to exceed the posted speed limit, based upon an engineering study and recommendation by the road
authority. The engineering study must be conducted by the road authority and must conform with
the manual and specifications adopted under section 169.06, subdivision 1, and applicable state and
federal standards. The road authority shall consult the public transit operator before recommending
operating conditions different from those authorized by law.

     (b) A child passenger restraint system is not required for a child who cannot, in the judgment of
a licensed physician, be safely transported in a child passenger restraint system because of a medical
condition, body size, or physical disability. A motor vehicle operator claiming exemption for a child
under this paragraph must possess a typewritten statement from the physician stating that the child
cannot be safely transported in a child passenger restraint system. The statement must give the name
and birth date of the child, be dated within the previous six months, and be made on the physician's
letterhead or contain the physician's name, address, and telephone number. A person charged with
violating subdivision 5 may not be convicted if the person produces the physician's statement in
court or in the office of the arresting officer.
     (c) A person offering a motor vehicle for rent or lease shall provide a child passenger restraint

or fee may be charged for use of the child passenger restraint device.
   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.685, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Appropriation; special account; legislative report. The Minnesota child passenger
restraint and education account is created in the state treasury, consisting of fines collected under
subdivision 5 and other money appropriated or donated. The money in the account is annually
appropriated to the commissioner of public safety, to be used to provide child passenger restraint
systems to families in financial need ­an

the transportation of pupils to and from school using type III vehicles or school buses with a gross
vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less, and to provide an educational program on the need for
and proper use of child passenger restraint systems. The commissioner shall report to the legislature
by February 1 of each odd-numbered year on the commissioner's activities and expenditure of funds
under this section.
   Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.826, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 1a. Harvest season increase amount; permit. The limitations provided in sections
169.823 to 169.829 are increased by ten percent from the beginning of harvest to November 30
each year for the movement of sugar beets, carrots, sweet corn, and potatoes from the field of
harvest to the point of the first unloading. Transfer of the product from a farm vehicle or small
farm trailer, within the meaning of chapter 168, to another vehicle is not considered to be the first
unloading. A permit issued under section 169.86, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), is required. The
commissioner shall not issue permits under this subdivision if to do so will result in a loss of
federal highway funding to the state.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.85, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Unloading. (a) Upon weighing a vehicle and load, as provided in this section, an officer
may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing until a portion of the
load is removed that is sufficient to reduce the gross weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted under
either section 168.013, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), or sections 169.823 to 169.829, whichever is
the lesser violation, if any. A suitable place is a location where loading or tampering with the load
is not prohibited by federal, state, or local law, rule, or ordinance.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c), a driver may be required to unload a vehicle only if
the weighing officer determines that (1) on routes subject to the provisions of sections 169.823 to
169.829, the weight on an axle exceeds the lawful gross weight prescribed by sections 169.823 to
169.829, by 2,000 pounds or more, or the weight on a group of two or more consecutive axles in cases
where the distance between the centers of the first and last axles of the group under consideration is
ten feet or less exceeds the lawful gross weight prescribed by sections 169.823 to 169.829, by 4,000
pounds or more; or (2) the weight is unlawful on an axle or group of consecutive axles on a road
restricted in accordance with section 169.87. Material unloaded must be cared for by the owner or
driver of the vehicle at the risk of the owner or driver.

    Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.86, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Permit authorities; restrictions. (a) The commissioner, with respect to
highways under the commissioner's jurisdiction, and local authorities, with respect to highways
under their jurisdiction, may, in their discretion, upon application in writing and good cause being
shown therefor, issue a special permit, in writing, authorizing the applicant to move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles of a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified
in this chapter, exceeding the gross weight for which the vehicle is registered under chapter 168,
or otherwise not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, upon any highway under the
jurisdiction of the party granting such permit and for the maintenance of which such party is
responsible.
    (b) Permits relating to over-width, over-length manufactured homes shall not be issued to
persons other than manufactured home dealers or manufacturers for movement of new units owned
by the manufactured home dealer or manufacturer, until the person has presented a statement from
the county auditor and treasurer where the unit is presently located, stating that all personal and real
property taxes have been paid. Upon payment of the most recent single year delinquent personal
property or current year taxes only, the county auditor or treasurer must issue a taxes paid statement
to a manufactured home dealer or a financial institution desiring to relocate a manufactured home
that has been repossessed. This statement must be dated within 30 days of the contemplated move.
The statement from the county auditor and treasurer where the unit is presently located, stating that
all personal and real property taxes have been paid, may be made by telephone. If the statement
is obtained by telephone, the permit shall contain the date and time of the telephone call and the
names of the persons in the auditor's office and treasurer's office who verified that all personal and
real property taxes had been paid.
    (c) The commissioner may not grant a permit authorizing the movement, in a three-vehicle
combination, of a semitrailer or trailer that exceeds 28-1/2 feet, except that the commissioner (1)
may renew a permit that was granted before April 16, 1984, for the movement of a semitrailer or
trailer that exceeds the length limitation in section 169.81, subdivision 2, or (2) may grant a permit

The amounts added are rounded to the nearest cent for each axle or axle group. The additional cost
does not apply to paragraph (c), clauses (1) and (3).
For a vehicle found to exceed the appropriate maximum permitted weight, a cost-per-mile fee of 22
cents per ton, or fraction of a ton, over the permitted maximum weight is imposed in addition to the
normal permit fee. Miles must be calculated based on the distance already traveled in the state plus
the distance from the point of detection to a transportation loading site or unloading site within the
state or to the point of exit from the state.
   (f) As an alternative to paragraph (e), an annual permit may be issued for overweight, or oversize

    (j) Beginning August 1, 2006, $200 for an annual permit for a vehicle operating under authority
of section 169.824, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause (2).
    Sec. 46. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.86, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5a. Weight increase surcharge. The commissioner shall impose a weight increase
surcharge on the fee charged for a special permit issued under this chapter when the gross weight
allowed under the permit is greater than the gross weight for which the vehicle is registered under
section 168.013. The surcharge shall be calculated as the difference between the registration
tax paid under section 168.013, and the additional tax that would be due under section 168.013,
subdivision 1e, at the gross weight allowed under the permit, prorated by the number of days for
which the permit is effective. Proceeds of the surcharge must be deposited in the state treasury and
credited to the trunk highway fund.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2012, and applies to all registrations
that are effective on and after that date and special permits issued on and after that date.
    Sec. 47. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 171.03, is amended to read:
