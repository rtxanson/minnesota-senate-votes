    Subd. 3. Licensing requirements. (a) Each design-builder shall employ, or have as a partner,
member, officer, coventurer, or subcontractor, a person duly licensed and registered to provide the
design services required to complete the project and do business in the state, including the provision
of sureties of sufficient amount to protect the interests of the awarding municipality.
    (b) A design-builder may enter into a contract to provide professional or construction services
for a project that the design-builder is not licensed, registered, or qualified to perform, so long as
the design-builder provides those services through subcontractors with duly licensed, registered,
or otherwise qualified individuals in accordance with Minnesota Statutes, sections 161.3410 to
161.3428.
    (c) Nothing in this section authorizing design-build contracts is intended to limit or eliminate the
responsibility or liability owed by a professional on a design-build project to the state, municipality,
or other third party under existing law.
    (d) The design service portion of a design-build contract must be considered a service and not
a product.
    Subd. 4. Information session for municipal engineer. After a project is selected for
participation in the design-build contracting p

                                                  ­­t program, the commissioner or the commissioner's
designee with design-build experience shall conduct an information session for the municipality's
engineer for each selected project, in which issues unique to design-build must be discussed,
including, but not limited to, writing an RFP, project oversight requirements, assessing risk, and
communication with the design-build firm. After participation in the information session, the
municipality's engineer is qualified to post the selected project, along with any future design-build
project RFP in the p ­­l
                      i­o­­
                          t program.
    Subd. 5. Technical Review Committee. During the phase one RFQ and before solicitation, the
municipality shall appoint a Technical Review Committee of at least five individuals. The Technical
Review Committee must include an individual whose name and qualifications are submitted to the
municipality by the Minnesota chapter of the Associated General Contractors, after consultation
with other commercial contractor associations in the state. Members of the Technical Review
Committee who are not state employees are subject to the Minnesota Government Data Practices
Act and Minnesota Statutes, section 16C.06, to the same extent that state agencies are subject
to those provisions. A Technical Review Committee member may not participate in the review
or discussion of responses to the RFQ or RFP when a design-build firm in which the member
has a financial interest has responded to the RFQ or RFP. "Financial interest" includes, but is not
limited to, being or serving as an owner, employee, partner, limited liability partner, shareholder,
joint venturer, family member, officer, or director of a design-build firm responding to an RFQ or
RFP for a specific project, or having any other economic interest in that design-build firm. The
members of the Technical Review Committee must be treated as municipal employees in the event
of litigation resulting from any action arising out of their service on the committee.
    Subd. 6. Phase one; design-build RFQ. The municipality shall prepare an RFQ, which must
include the following:
   (1) the minimum qualifications of design-builders necessary to meet the requirements for
acceptance;
   (2) a scope of work statement and schedule;
4130                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [83RD DAY

   (3) documents defining the project requirements;
   (4) the form of contract to be awarded;
    (5) the weighted selection criteria for compiling a short list and the number of firms to be included
in the short list, which must be at least two but not more than five;
   (6) a description of the request for proposals (RFP) requirements;
   (7) the maximum time allowed for design and construction;
   (8) the municipality's estimated cost of design and construction;
    (9) requirements for construction experience, design experience, financial, personnel, and
equipment resources available from potential design-builders for the project and experience in
other design-build transportation projects or similar projects, provided that these requirements may
not unduly restrict competition; and
   (10) a statement that "past performance" or "experience" or other criteria used in the RFQ
evaluation process does not include the exercise or assertion of a person's legal rights.
    Subd. 7. Information session for prospective design-build firms. After a design-build project
is advertised, any prospective design-build firm shall attend a design-build information session
conducted by the commissioner or the commissioner's designee with design-build experience.
The information must include information about design-build contracts, including, but not
limited to, communication with partner firms, project oversight requirements, assessing risk, and
communication with the municipality's engineer. After participation in the information session, the
design-build firm is eligible to bid on the design-build project and any future design-build p­­l
                                                                                                i­o
                                                                                                  ­­t
program projects.
    Subd. 8. Evaluation. The selection team shall evaluate the design-build qualifications of
responding firms and shall compile a short list of no more than five most highly qualified firms in
accordance with qualifications criteria described in the RFQ. If only one design-build firm responds
to the RFQ or remains on the short list, the municipality may readvertise or cancel the project as
the municipality deems necessary.
    Subd. 9. Phase two; design-build RFP. The municipality shall prepare an RFP, which must
include:
    (1) the scope of work, including (i) performance and technical requirements, (ii) conceptual
design, (iii) specifications consistent with state standards and specifications, and (iv) functional and
operational elements for the delivery of the completed project, all of which must be prepared by a
registered or licensed professional engineer;
   (2) copies of the contract documents that the successful proposer will be expected to sign;
   (3) the maximum time allowable for design and construction;
   (4) the road authority's estimated cost of design and construction;
   (5) the requirement that a submitted proposal be segmented into two parts, a technical proposal
and a price proposal;

    (6) the requirement that each proposal be in a separately sealed, clearly identified package and
include the date and time of the submittal deadline;
    (7) the requirement that the technical proposal include a critical path method, bar schedule of the
work to be performed, or similar schematic; preliminary design plans and specifications; technical
reports; calculations; permit requirements; applicable development fees; and other data requested
in the RFP;
    (8) the requirement that the price proposal contain all design, construction, engineering,
inspection, and construction costs of the proposed project;
   (9) the requirement that surety be submitted equal to the total amount of the proposal;
    (10) a description of the qualifications required of the design-builder and the selection criteria,
including the weight of each criterion and subcriterion;
   (11) the date, time, and location of the public opening of the sealed price proposals;
   (12) the amount of, and eligibility for, a stipulated fee;
   (13) other information relevant to the project; and
   (14) a statement that "past performance," "experience," or other criteria used in the RFP
evaluation process does not include the exercise or assertion of a person's legal rights.
   Subd. 10. Design-build award; computation; announcement. A design-build contract shall
be awarded as follows:
    (a) The Technical Review Committee shall score the technical proposals of the proposers
selected under subdivision 8 using the selection criteria in the RFP. The Technical Review
Committee shall then submit a technical proposal score for each design-builder to the municipality.
The Technical Review Committee shall reject any nonresponsive proposal, including those unable
to provide sufficient surety to guarantee project completion. The municipality shall review the
technical proposal scores.
   (b) The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall review the technical proposal scores.
The commissioner shall submit the final technical proposal scores to the municipality.
    (c) The municipality shall announce the technical proposal score for each design-builder and
shall publicly open the sealed price proposals and shall divide each design-builder's price by the
technical score that the commissioner has given to it to obtain an adjusted score. The design-builder
selected must be that responsive and responsible design-builder whose adjusted score is the lowest.
  (d) If a time factor is included with the selection criteria in the RFP package, the municipality
may use a value of the time factor established by the municipality as a criterion in the RFP.
    (e) Unless all proposals are rejected, the municipality shall award the contract to the responsive
and responsible design-builder with the lowest adjusted score. The municipality shall reserve the
right to reject all proposals.
   (f) The municipality shall award a stipulated fee not less than two-tenths of one percent of
the municipality's estimated cost of design and construction to each short-listed, responsible
4132                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [83RD DAY

proposer who provides a responsive but unsuccessful proposal. If the municipality does not award
a contract, all short-listed proposers must receive the stipulated fee. If the municipality cancels the
contract before reviewing the technical proposals, the municipality shall award each design-builder
on the short list a stipulated fee of not less than two-tenths of one percent of the municipality's
estimated cost of design and construction. The municipality shall pay the stipulated fee to each
proposer within 90 days after the award of the contract or the decision not to award a contract.
In consideration for paying the stipulated fee, the municipality may use any ideas or information
contained in the proposals in connection with any contract awarded for the project or in connection
with a subsequent procurement, without any obligation to pay any additional compensation to the
unsuccessful proposers. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subdivision, an unsuccessful
short-list proposer may elect to waive the stipulated fee. If an unsuccessful short-list proposer
elects to waive the stipulated fee, the municipality may not use ideas and information contained in
that proposer's proposal. Upon the request of the municipality, a proposer who waived a stipulated
fee may withdraw the waiver, in which case the municipality shall pay the stipulated fee to the
proposer and thereafter may use ideas and information in the proposer's proposal.
    (g) The municipality shall not limit the ability of design-builders that have submitted
proposals to protest a contemplated or actual award by the commissioner by, among other things,
unreasonably restricting the time to protest; restricting the right to seek judicial review of the
commissioner's actions; attempting to change the judicial standard of review; or requiring the
protestor to pay attorney fees for an unsuccessful, nonfrivolous protest. Unless all design-builders
that have submitted proposals agree to execution of a contract for the project without a waiting
period beforehand, the municipality shall wait at least seven days after both the award of the
project and public disclosure of the Technical Review Committee's scoring data and the successful
proposal before executing a contract for the project.
    Subd. 11. Low-bid design-build process. (a) The municipality may also use low-bid,
design-build procedures to award a design-build contract where the scope of the work can be
clearly defined.
   (b) Low-bid design-build projects may require an RFQ and short-listing, and must require an
RFP.
    (c) Submitted proposals under this subdivision must include separately a technical proposal and
a price proposal. The low-bid, design-build procedures must follow a two-step process for review
of the responses to the RFP as follows:
   (1) the first step is the review of the technical proposal by the Technical Review Committee as
provided in subdivision 5. The Technical Review Committee must open the technical proposal first
and must determine if it complies with the requirements of the RFP and is responsive. The Technical
Review Committee may not perform any ranking or scoring of the technical proposals; and
  (2) the second step is the determination of the low bidder based on the price proposal. The
municipality may not open the price proposal until the review of the technical proposal is complete.
  (d) The contract award under low-bid, design-build procedures must be made to the proposer
whose sealed bid is responsive to the technical requirements as determined by the Technical Review
Committee and that is also the lowest bid.
   (e) A stipulated fee may be paid for unsuccessful bids on low-bid, design-build projects only

    "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 16A.065, is amended to read:
    16A.065 PREPAY SOFTWARE, SUBSCRIPTIONS, UNITED STATES DOCUMENTS.
    Notwithstanding section 16A.41, subdivision 1, the commissioner may allow an agency to make
advance deposits or payments for software or software maintenance services for state-owned or
leased electronic data processing equipment, for sole source maintenance agreements where it is not
cost-effective to pay in arrears, for exhibit booth space or boat slip rental when required by the renter
to guarantee the availability of space, for short-term cash flow advances under executed grants or
contracts associated with land acquisitions, for registration fees where advance payment is required
or advance payment discount is provided, and for newspaper, magazine, and other subscription
fees customarily paid for in advance. The commissioner may also allow advance deposits by any
department with the Library of Congress and federal Supervisor of Documents for items to be
purchased from those federal agencies.
    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 84.027, subdivision 15, is amended to read:
    Subd. 15. Electronic transactions. (a) The commissioner may receive an application for, sell,
and issue any license, stamp, permit, pass, sticker, gift card, safety training certification, registration,
or transfer under the jurisdiction of the commissioner by electronic means, including by telephone.
Notwithstanding section 97A.472, electronic and telephone transactions may be made outside of
the state. The commissioner may:
    (1) provide for the electronic transfer of funds generated by electronic transactions, including
by telephone;
    (2) assign an identification number to an applicant who purchases a hunting or fishing license or
recreational vehicle registration by electronic means, to serve as temporary authorization to engage
in the activity requiring a license or registration until the license or registration is received or expires;
    (3) charge and permit agents to charge a fee of individuals who make electronic transactions and
transactions by telephone or Internet, including issuing fees and an additional transaction fee not to
exceed $3.50;
    (4) charge and permit agents to charge a convenience fee not to exceed three percent of the cost of
the license to individuals who use electronic bank cards for payment. An electronic licensing system
agent charging a fee of individuals making an electronic bank card transaction in person must post
a sign informing individuals of the fee. The sign must be near the point of payment, clearly visible,
include the amount of the fee, and state: "License agents are allowed by state law to charge a fee
not to exceed three percent of the cost of state licenses to persons who use electronic bank cards for
payment. The fee is not required by state law.";
   (5) establish, by written order, an electronic licensing system commission to be paid by revenues
generated from all sales made through the electronic licensing system. The commissioner shall

establish the commission in a manner that neither significantly overrecovers nor underrecovers costs
involved in providing the electronic licensing system; and
     (6) adopt rules to administer the provisions of this subdivision.
    (b) The fees established under paragraph (a), clauses (3) and (4), and the commission established
under paragraph (a), clause (5), are not subject to the rulemaking procedures of chapter 14 and
section 14.386 does not apply.
    (c) Money received from fees and commissions collected under this subdivision, including
interest earned, is annually appropriated from the game and fish fund and the natural resources
fund to the commissioner for the cost of electronic licensing.
    (d) Game and fish licenses under chapters 97A, 97B, and 97C shall be available by electronic
transaction, regardless of whether all or any part of the biennial appropriation law for the
department has been enacted. If, by July 1 of an odd-numbered year, legislation has not been
enacted to appropriate money to the commissioner of management and budget for central
accounting, procurement, payroll, and human resources functions, amounts necessary to operate
those functions for the purpose of this paragraph are appropriated from the general fund to the
commissioner of management and budget. As necessary, the commissioner may transfer a portion
of this appropriation to other state agencies to support carrying out these functions. Any subsequent
appropriation to the commissioner of management and budget for a biennium in which this section
is applicable supersedes and replaces the funding authorized in this paragraph. This paragraph may
be cited as the "Freedom to Hunt and Fish Act of 2012."
     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 84.67, is amended to read:
     84.67 FORESTS FOR THE FUTURE REVOLVING ACCOUNT.

account is appropriated to the commissioner of natural resources for the acquisition of forest lands
that meet the eligibility criteria in section 84.66, subdivision 4. The commissioner shall sell the lands
acquired under this section, subject to an easement as provided in section 84.66. Money received
from the sale of forest lands acquired under this section and interest earned on the account shall
be deposited into the account. T               ­h­­e­­

    (c) In addition to paragraph (b), a conservation officer or other licensed peace officer may inspect
any watercraft or water-related equipment that is stopped at a water access site, any other public
location in the state, or a private location where the watercraft or water-related equipment is in
plain view, if the officer determines there is reason to believe that aquatic invasive species, aquatic
macrophytes, or water is present on the watercraft or water-related equipment.
    (d) Conservation officers or other licensed peace officers may utilize check stations in locations,
or in proximity to locations, where watercraft or other water-related equipment is placed into or
removed from waters of the state. Any check stations shall be operated in a manner that minimizes
delays to vehicles, equipment, and their occupants.
    (e) Conservation officers or other licensed peace officers may order water-related equipment to
be removed from a water body if the commissioner determines such action is needed to implement
aquatic invasive species control measures.
   (f) The commissioner may require mandatory inspections of water-related equipment before a
person places or removes water-related equipment into or out of a water body. Inspection stations
may be located at or near public water accesses or in locations that allow for servicing multiple
water bodies. The commissioner shall ensure that inspection stations:
      (1) have adequate staffing to minimize delays to vehicles and their occupants;
    (2) allow for reasonable travel times between public accesses and inspection stations if
inspection is required before placing water-related equipment into a water body;
      (3) are located so as not to create traffic delays or public safety issues;
   (4) have decontamination equipment available to bring water-related equipment into
compliance; and
      (5) do not reduce the capacity or hours of operation of public water accesses.
    (g) The commissioner may authorize tribal and local governments that enter into a delegation
agreement with the commissioner to conduct mandatory inspections of water-related equipment at
specified locations within a defined area before a person places or removes water-related equipment
into or out of a water body. Tribal and local governments that are authorized to conduct inspections
under this paragraph must:
  (1) assume all legal, financial, and administrative responsibilities for implementing the
mandatory inspections, alone or in agreement with other tribal or local governments;
      (2) employ inspectors that have been trained and authorized by the commissioner;
    (3) conduct inspections and decontamination measures in accordance with guidelines approved
by the commissioner;
   (4) have decontamination equipment available at inspection stations or identify alternative
decontamination equipment locations within a reasonable distance of the inspection station that
can bring water-related equipment into compliance;
      (5) provide for inspection station locations that do not create traffic delays or public safety issues;
and

where authorized inspectors are placed directly at one or more water access sites, with no
requirement for a person to travel from the water access for inspection or decontamination, and
no local ordinance or other regulation requiring a mandatory inspection before placing watercraft
or water-related equipment into a water body or after watercraft or water-related equipment are
removed from a water body.

   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 85.055, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Fee deposit and appropriation; continued operation. (a) The fees collected under
this section shall be deposited in the natural resources fund and credited to the state parks account.
Money in the account, except for the electronic licensing system commission established by
the commissioner under section 84.027, subdivision 15, is available for appropriation to the
commissioner to operate and maintain the state park system.
    (b) State parks and recreation areas shall remain open for camping and other recreational
activities, regardless of whether all or any part of the biennial appropriation law for the state parks
and recreation areas has been enacted. The amount necessary for operations of state parks and
recreation areas when the biennial appropriation law has not been enacted is appropriated from the
state parks account in the natural resources fund. If, by July 1 of an odd-numbered year, legislation
has not been enacted to appropriate money to the commissioner of management and budget for
central accounting, procurement, payroll, and human resources functions, amounts necessary to
operate those functions for the purpose of this paragraph are appropriated from the general fund

subsequent appropriation to the commissioner of management and budget for a biennium in which
this paragraph has been applied supersedes and replaces the funding authorized in this paragraph.

     Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103B.101, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 14. Local water management coordination. (a) The board may adopt resolutions,
policies, or orders that allow a comprehensive plan, local water management plan, or watershed
management plan, developed or amended, approved and adopted, according to chapter 103B,

103C, or 103D to serve as substitutes for one another or be replaced with a comprehensive
watershed management plan. The board may also develop criteria for incorporating or coordinating
the elements of metropolitan county groundwater plans in accordance with section 103B.255.
The board shall, to the extent practicable, incorporate a watershed approach when adopting the
resolutions, policies, or orders, and shall establish a suggested watershed boundary framework for
development, approval, adoption, and coordination of plans.
    (b) The board shall work with local government stakeholders and others to foster mutual
understanding and develop recommendations for local water management and related state water
management policy and programs. The board may convene informal working groups or work teams
to develop information, education, and recommendations. Local government units may develop
and carry out TMDL implementation plans, or their equivalent, as provided in chapter 114D, as part
of the local water management plans and responsibilities under chapters 103B, 103C, and 103D.
     Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103B.101, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 15. Local water management boundary and plan determinations and appeals. (a)
Local government units may either submit a request for a plan boundary determination as part
of a plan approval request or apply separately for a plan boundary determination from the board
before requesting plan approval. Local government units must provide written documentation of the
rationale and justification for the proposed boundary. The board may request additional information
needed to make a plan boundary determination.
    (b) Local government units may appeal a board decision to deny approval of a plan or the
establishment of a plan boundary. An appeal of a board decision may be taken to the state Court of
Appeals and must be considered an appeal from a contested case decision for purposes of judicial
review under sections 14.63 to 14.69. Local government units may request the board's dispute
resolution committee or executive director to hear and make recommendations to resolve boundary
and plan implementation disputes.
     Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103B.311, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
     Subd. 4. Water plan requirements. (a) A local water management plan must:
     (1) cover the entire area within a county;
     (2) address water problems in the context of watershed units and groundwater systems;
   (3) be based upon principles of sound hydrologic management of water, effective environmental
protection, and efficient management;
    (4) be consistent with local water management plans prepared by counties and watershed
management organizations wholly or partially within a single watershed unit or groundwater
system; and
     (5) the local water management plan must specify the period covered by the local water
management plan and must extend at least five years but no more than ten years from the date
the board approves the local water management plan. Local water management plans that contain
revision dates inconsistent with this section must comply with that date, provided it is not more
than ten years beyond the date of board approval. A            ­­

and program accomplishments.
     Subd. 5. Financial assistance. A base grant may be awarded to a county that provides a match
utilizing a water implementation tax or other local source. A water implementation tax that a county
intends to use as a match to the base grant must be levied at a rate determined by the board. T                                               ­h­­

    Subdivision 1. Requirements. (a) Wetlands must not be drained or filled, wholly or partially,
unless replaced by restoring or creating wetland areas of at least equal public value under
a replacement plan approved as provided in section 103G.2242, a replacement plan under a
local governmental unit's comprehensive wetland protection and management plan approved by
the board under section 103G.2243, or, if a permit to mine is required under section 93.481,
under a mining reclamation plan approved by the commissioner under the permit to mine. For
project-specific wetland replacement completed prior to wetland impacts authorized or conducted
under a permit to mine within the Great Lakes and Rainy River watershed basins, those basins
shall be considered a single watershed for purposes of determining wetland replacement ratios.
Mining reclamation plans shall apply the same principles and standards for replacing wetlands by
restoration or creation of wetland areas that are applicable to mitigation plans approved as provided
in section 103G.2242. Public value must be determined in accordance with section 103B.3355 or
a comprehensive wetland protection and management plan established under section 103G.2243.
Sections 103G.221 to 103G.2372 also apply to excavation in permanently and semipermanently
flooded areas of types 3, 4, and 5 wetlands.
    (b) Replacement must be guided by the following principles in descending order of priority:
    (1) avoiding the direct or indirect impact of the activity that may destroy or diminish the wetland;
   (2) minimizing the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the wetland activity and its
implementation;
   (3) rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected wetland
environment;
   (4) reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations
during the life of the activity;
    (5) compensating for the impact by restoring a wetland; and
   (6) compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute wetland resources or
environments.
    For a project involving the draining or filling of wetlands in an amount not exceeding 10,000
square feet more than the applicable amount in section 103G.2241, subdivision 9, paragraph (a), the
local government unit may make an on-site sequencing determination without a written alternatives
analysis from the applicant.
     (c) If a wetland is located in a cultivated field, then replacement must be accomplished through
restoration only without regard to the priority order in paragraph (b), provided that ­    a­d

   (e) Restoration and replacement of wetlands must be accomplished in accordance with the
ecology of the landscape area affected and ponds that are created primarily to fulfill storm water
management, and water quality treatment requirements may not be used to satisfy replacement
requirements under this chapter unless the design includes pretreatment of runoff and the pond is
functioning as a wetland.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraph (g), for a wetland or public waters wetland located on
nonagricultural land, replacement must be in the ratio of two acres of replaced wetland for each
acre of drained or filled wetland.
    (g) For a wetland or public waters wetland located on agricultural land or in a greater than 80
percent area, replacement must be in the ratio of one acre of replaced wetland for each acre of
drained or filled wetland.
    (h) Wetlands that are restored or created as a result of an approved replacement plan are subject
to the provisions of this section for any subsequent drainage or filling.
    (i) Except in a greater than 80 percent area, only wetlands that have been restored from
previously drained or filled wetlands, wetlands created by excavation in nonwetlands, wetlands
created by dikes or dams along public or private drainage ditches, or wetlands created by dikes
or dams associated with the restoration of previously drained or filled wetlands may be used in a
statewide banking program established in rules adopted under section 103G.2242, subdivision 1.
Modification or conversion of nondegraded naturally occurring wetlands from one type to another
are not eligible for enrollment in a statewide wetlands bank.
    (j) The Technical Evaluation Panel established under section 103G.2242, subdivision 2,
shall ensure that sufficient time has occurred for the wetland to develop wetland characteristics
of soils, vegetation, and hydrology before recommending that the wetland be deposited in the
statewide wetland bank. If the Technical Evaluation Panel has reason to believe that the wetland
characteristics may change substantially, the panel shall postpone its recommendation until the
wetland has stabilized.
    (k) This section and sections 103G.223 to 103G.2242, 103G.2364, and 103G.2365 apply to the
state and its departments and agencies.
    (l) For projects involving draining or filling of wetlands associated with a new public
transportation project, and for projects expanded solely for additional traffic capacity, public
transportation authorities may purchase credits from the board at the cost to the board to establish
credits. Proceeds from the sale of credits provided under this paragraph are appropriated to the
board for the purposes of this paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, "transportation
project" does not include an airport project.
     (m) A replacement plan for wetlands is not required for individual projects that result in the
filling or draining of wetlands for the repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or replacement of a
currently serviceable existing state, city, county, or town public road necessary, as determined by the
public transportation authority, to meet state or federal design or safety standards or requirements,
excluding new roads or roads expanded solely for additional traffic capacity lanes. This paragraph
only applies to authorities for public transportation projects that:
   (1) minimize the amount of wetland filling or draining associated with the project and consider

mitigating important site-specific wetland functions on site;
    (2) except as provided in clause (3), submit project-specific reports to the board, the Technical
Evaluation Panel, the commissioner of natural resources, and members of the public requesting a
copy at least 30 days prior to construction that indicate the location, amount, and type of wetlands to
be filled or drained by the project or, alternatively, convene an annual meeting of the parties required
to receive notice to review projects to be commenced during the upcoming year; and
    (3) for minor and emergency maintenance work impacting less than 10,000 square feet, submit
project-specific reports, within 30 days of commencing the activity, to the board that indicate the
location, amount, and type of wetlands that have been filled or drained.
    Those required to receive notice of public transportation projects may appeal minimization,
delineation, and on-site mitigation decisions made by the public transportation authority to the board
according to the provisions of section 103G.2242, subdivision 9. The Technical Evaluation Panel
shall review minimization and delineation decisions made by the public transportation authority and
provide recommendations regarding on-site mitigation if requested to do so by the local government
unit, a contiguous landowner, or a member of the Technical Evaluation Panel.
     Except for state public transportation projects, for which the state Department of Transportation
is responsible, the board must replace the wetlands, and wetland areas of public waters if authorized
by the commissioner or a delegated authority, drained or filled by public transportation projects on
existing roads.
    Public transportation authorities at their discretion may deviate from federal and state design
standards on existing road projects when practical and reasonable to avoid wetland filling or
draining, provided that public safety is not unreasonably compromised. The local road authority
and its officers and employees are exempt from liability for any tort claim for injury to persons or
property arising from travel on the highway and related to the deviation from the design standards
for construction or reconstruction under this paragraph. This paragraph does not preclude an action
for damages arising from negligence in construction or maintenance on a highway.
    (n) If a landowner seeks approval of a replacement plan after the proposed project has already
affected the wetland, the local government unit may require the landowner to replace the affected
wetland at a ratio not to exceed twice the replacement ratio otherwise required.
   (o) A local government unit may request the board to reclassify a county or watershed on
the basis of its percentage of presettlement wetlands remaining. After receipt of satisfactory
documentation from the local government, the board shall change the classification of a county
or watershed. If requested by the local government unit, the board must assist in developing the
documentation. Within 30 days of its action to approve a change of wetland classifications, the
board shall publish a notice of the change in the Environmental Quality Board Monitor.
   (p) One hundred citizens who reside within the jurisdiction of the local government unit may
request the local government unit to reclassify a county or watershed on the basis of its percentage of
presettlement wetlands remaining. In support of their petition, the citizens shall provide satisfactory
documentation to the local government unit. The local government unit shall consider the petition
and forward the request to the board under paragraph (o) or provide a reason why the petition is
denied.

     Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103G.2241, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
     Subdivision 1. Agricultural activities. A replacement plan for wetlands is not required for:
    (1) activities in a wetland that was planted with annually seeded crops, was in a crop rotation
seeding of pasture grass or legumes, or was required to be set aside to receive price support or other
payments under United States Code, title 7, sections 1421 to 1469, in six of the last ten years prior
to January 1, 1991;
    (2) activities in a type 1 wetland on agricultural pasture land that remains in the same use, except
for bottomland hardwood type 1 wetlands, and activities in a type 2 or type 6 wetland that is less
than two acres in size and located on agricultural pasture land that remains in the same use;
    (3) activities in a wetland conducted as part of normal farming practices. For purposes of this
clause, "normal farming practices" means farming, silvicultural, grazing, and ranching activities
such as plowing, seeding, cultivating, and harvesting for the production of feed, food, and fiber
products, but does not include activities that result in the draining of wetlands;
    (4) soil and water conservation practices approved by the soil and water conservation district,
after review by the Technical Evaluation Panel;
    (5) aquaculture activities including pond excavation and construction and maintenance of
associated access roads and dikes authorized under, and conducted in accordance with, a permit
issued by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the federal Clean Water
Act, United States Code, title 33, section 1344, but not including construction or expansion of
buildings;
   (6) wild rice production activities, including necessary diking and other activities authorized
under a permit issued by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the federal
Clean Water Act, United States Code, title 33, section 1344; or
     (7) agricultural activities on agricultural land that is subject to federal farm program restrictions

    (1) a summary of the current status of solid waste management, including the amount of solid
waste generated and reduced, the manner in which it is collected, processed, and disposed, the extent
of separation, recycling, reuse, and recovery of solid waste, and the facilities available or under
development to manage the waste;
    (2) an evaluation of the extent and effectiveness of implementation ­   an
                                                                             ­d­ of section 115A.02,
including an assessment of progress in accomplishing state policies, goals, and objectives, including
those listed in paragraph (b);
    (3) identification of issues requiring further research, study, and action, the appropriate scope
of the research, study, or action, the state agency or political subdivision that should implement the
research, study, or action, and a schedule for completion of the activity; and
   (4) recommendations for establishing or modifying state solid waste management policies,
authorities, responsibilities, and programs.
    (b) Beginning in 1997, and every sixth year thereafter, the report shall be expanded to include
the metropolitan area solid waste policy plan required in section 473.149, subdivision 1, and
strategies for the agency to advance the goals of this chapter, to manage waste as a resource,
to further reduce the need for expenditures on resource recovery and disposal facilities, and to
further reduce long-term environmental and financial liabilities. The expanded report must include
strategies for:
     (1) achieving the maximum feasible reduction in waste generation;

    (2) encouraging manufacturers to design products that eliminate or reduce the adverse
environmental impacts of resource extraction, manufacturing, use, and waste processing and
disposal;
    (3) educating businesses, public entities, and other consumers about the need to consider the
potential environmental and financial impacts of purchasing products that may create a liability or
that may be expensive to recycle or manage as waste, due to the presence of toxic or hazardous
components;
   (4) eliminating or reducing toxic or hazardous components in compost from municipal solid
waste composting facilities, in ash from municipal solid waste incinerators, and in leachate and air
emissions from municipal solid waste landfills, in order to reduce the potential liability of waste
generators, facility owners and operators, and taxpayers;
    (5) encouraging the source separation of materials to the extent practicable, so that the materials
are most appropriately managed and to ensure that resources that can be reused or recycled are not
disposed of or destroyed; and
    (6) maximizing the efficiency of the waste management system by managing waste and
recyclables close to the point of generation, taking into account the characteristics of the resources
to be recovered from the waste and the type and capacity of local facilities.
     Sec. 49. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 115A.551, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Supplementary recycling goals. ­

                                               ) By December 31, 1996, each county will have
as a goal to recycle the following amounts:
   (1) for a county outside of the metropolitan area, 35 percent by weight of total solid waste
generation;
     (2) for a metropolitan county, 50 percent by weight of total solid waste generation.
    Each county will develop and implement or require political subdivisions within the county to
develop and implement programs, practices, or methods designed to meet its recycling goal. Nothing
in this section or in any other law may be construed to prohibit a county from establishing a higher
recycling goal.

    Subdivision 1. Requirement to submit progress report. (a) All persons required to prepare a
toxic pollution prevention plan under section 115D.07 shall submit an annual progress report to the
commissioner of public safety that may be drafted in a manner that does not disclose proprietary
information. Progress reports are due on O­­t­­

due in 1992.
     (b) At a minimum, each progress report must include:
    (1) a summary of each objective established in the plan, including the base year for any objective
stated in numeric terms, and the schedule for meeting each objective;
    (2) a summary of progress made during the past year, if any, toward meeting each objective
established in the plan including the quantity of each toxic pollutant eliminated or reduced;
     (3) a statement of the methods through which elimination or reduction has been achieved;
    (4) if necessary, an explanation of the reasons objectives were not achieved during the previous
year, including identification of any technological, economic, or other impediments the facility faced
in its efforts to achieve its objectives; and

penalty of section 609.63, attesting that a plan meeting the requirements of section 115D.07 has
been prepared and also attesting to the accuracy of the information in the progress report.
    Subd. 2. Review of progress reports. (a) The commissioner of public safety shall review all
progress reports to determine if they meet the requirements of subdivision 1. If the commissioner of
public safety determines that a progress report does not meet the requirements, the commissioner of
public safety shall notify the facility in writing and shall identify specific deficiencies and specify a
reasonable time period of not less than 90 days for the facility to modify the progress report.
    (b) The commissioner of public safety shall be given access to a facility plan required under
section 115D.07 if the commissioner of public safety determines that the progress report for that
facility does not meet the requirements of subdivision 1. Twenty-five or more persons living within
ten miles of the facility may submit a petition to the commissioner of public safety that identifies
specific deficiencies in the progress report and requests the commissioner of public safety to review
the facility plan. Within 30 days after receipt of the petition, the commissioner of public safety shall
respond in writing. If the commissioner of public safety agrees that the progress report does not
meet requirements of subdivision 1, the commissioner of public safety shall be given access to the
facility plan.
    (c) After reviewing the plan and the progress report with any modifications submitted,
the commissioner of public safety shall state in writing whether the progress report meets the
requirements of subdivision 1. If the commissioner of public safety determines that a modified
progress report still does not meet the requirements of subdivision 1, the commissioner of public
safety shall schedule a public meeting. The meeting shall be held in the county where the facility is
located. The meeting is not subject to the requirements of chapter 14.
    (d) The facility shall be given the opportunity to amend the progress report within a period of
not less than 30 days after the public meeting.
    (e) If the commissioner of public safety determines that a modified progress report still does
not meet the requirements of subdivision 1, action may be taken under section 115.071 to obtain
compliance with sections 115D.01 to 115D.12.

Interstate Commission. The report shall include any recommendations the commissioner deems
necessary to assure the protection of the interest of the state in the proper functioning of the

change in the status of a host state or other party states in the compact.
   Sec. 58. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 116D.04, subdivision 2a, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2a. When prepared. Where there is potential for significant environmental effects
resulting from any major governmental action, the action shall be preceded by a detailed
environmental impact statement prepared by the responsible governmental unit. The environmental
impact statement shall be an analytical rather than an encyclopedic document which describes the
proposed action in detail, analyzes its significant environmental impacts, discusses appropriate
alternatives to the proposed action and their impacts, and explores methods by which adverse
4164                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [83RD DAY

environmental impacts of an action could be mitigated. The environmental impact statement shall
also analyze those economic, employment and sociological effects that cannot be avoided should
the action be implemented. To ensure its use in the decision-making process, the environmental
impact statement shall be prepared as early as practical in the formulation of an action. No
mandatory environmental impact statement may be required for an ethanol plant, as defined in
section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), that produces less than 125,000,000 gallons of
ethanol annually and is located outside of the seven-county metropolitan area.
    (a) The board shall by rule establish categories of actions for which environmental impact
statements and for which environmental assessment worksheets shall be prepared as well as
categories of actions for which no environmental review is required under this section. A mandatory
environmental assessment worksheet shall not be required for the expansion of an ethanol plant,
as defined in section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), or the conversion of an ethanol plant
to a biobutanol facility or the expansion of a biobutanol facility as defined in section 41A.105,
subdivision 1a, based on the capacity of the expanded or converted facility to produce alcohol
fuel, but must be required if the ethanol plant or biobutanol facility meets or exceeds thresholds
of other categories of actions for which environmental assessment worksheets must be prepared.
The responsible governmental unit for an ethanol plant or biobutanol facility project for which
an environmental assessment worksheet is prepared shall be the state agency with the greatest
responsibility for supervising or approving the project as a whole.
    (b) The responsible governmental unit shall promptly publish notice of the completion of
an environmental assessment worksheet in a manner to be determined by the board and shall
provide copies of the environmental assessment worksheet to the board and its member agencies.
Comments on the need for an environmental impact statement may be submitted to the responsible
governmental unit during a 30-day period following publication of the notice that an environmental
assessment worksheet has been completed. The responsible governmental unit's decision on the
need for an environmental impact statement shall be based on the environmental assessment
worksheet and the comments received during the comment period, and shall be made within 15
days after the close of the comment period. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not
more than 15 additional days upon the request of the responsible governmental unit.
    (c) An environmental assessment worksheet shall also be prepared for a proposed action
whenever material evidence accompanying a petition by not less than 100 individuals who reside
or own property in the state, submitted before the proposed project has received final approval
by the appropriate governmental units, demonstrates that, because of the nature or location of a
proposed action, there may be potential for significant environmental effects. Petitions requesting
the preparation of an environmental assessment worksheet shall be submitted to the board. The
chair of the board shall determine the appropriate responsible governmental unit and forward the
petition to it. A decision on the need for an environmental assessment worksheet shall be made by
the responsible governmental unit within 15 days after the petition is received by the responsible
governmental unit. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not more than 15 additional
days upon request of the responsible governmental unit.
   (d) Except in an environmentally sensitive location where Minnesota Rules, part 4410.4300,
subpart 29, item B, applies, the proposed action is exempt from environmental review under this
chapter and rules of the board, if:
   (1) the proposed action is:

   (i) an animal feedlot facility with a capacity of less than 1,000 animal units; or
   (ii) an expansion of an existing animal feedlot facility with a total cumulative capacity of less
than 1,000 animal units;
    (2) the application for the animal feedlot facility includes a written commitment by the proposer
to design, construct, and operate the facility in full compliance with Pollution Control Agency
feedlot rules; and
    (3) the county board holds a public meeting for citizen input at least ten business days prior
to the Pollution Control Agency or county issuing a feedlot permit for the animal feedlot facility
unless another public meeting for citizen input has been held with regard to the feedlot facility to be
permitted. The exemption in this paragraph is in addition to other exemptions provided under other
law and rules of the board.
    (e) The board may, prior to final approval of a proposed project, require preparation of an
environmental assessment worksheet by a responsible governmental unit selected by the board for
any action where environmental review under this section has not been specifically provided for by
rule or otherwise initiated.
    (f) An early and open process shall be utilized to limit the scope of the environmental impact
statement to a discussion of those impacts, which, because of the nature or location of the project,
have the potential for significant environmental effects. The same process shall be utilized to
determine the form, content and level of detail of the statement as well as the alternatives which
are appropriate for consideration in the statement. In addition, the permits which will be required
for the proposed action shall be identified during the scoping process. Further, the process shall
identify those permits for which information will be developed concurrently with the environmental
impact statement. The board shall provide in its rules for the expeditious completion of the scoping
process. The determinations reached in the process shall be incorporated into the order requiring
the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (g) The responsible governmental unit shall, to the extent practicable, avoid duplication and
ensure coordination between state and federal environmental review and between environmental
review and environmental permitting. Whenever practical, information needed by a governmental
unit for making final decisions on permits or other actions required for a proposed project shall be
developed in conjunction with the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (h) An environmental impact statement shall be prepared and its adequacy determined within
280 days after notice of its preparation unless the time is extended by consent of the parties or
by the governor for good cause. The responsible governmental unit shall determine the adequacy
of an environmental impact statement, unless within 60 days after notice is published that an
environmental impact statement will be prepared, the board chooses to determine the adequacy of
an environmental impact statement. If an environmental impact statement is found to be inadequate,
the responsible governmental unit shall have 60 days to prepare an adequate environmental impact
statement.
    (i) The proposer of a specific action may include in the information submitted to the responsible
governmental unit a preliminary draft environmental impact statement under this section on
that action for review, modification, and determination of completeness and adequacy by the
responsible governmental unit. A preliminary draft environmental impact statement prepared by
4166                                          JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                   [83RD DAY

the project proposer and submitted to the responsible governmental unit shall identify or include as
an appendix all studies and other sources of information used to substantiate the analysis contained
in the preliminary draft environmental impact statement. The responsible governmental unit shall
require additional studies, if needed, and obtain from the project proposer all additional studies and
information necessary for the responsible governmental unit to perform its responsibility to review,
modify, and determine the completeness and adequacy of the environmental impact statement.

report must present the cost and financing analysis in the aggregate and broken down by county and
by major facility.

director of an ambulance service and must be billed by an eligible provider enrolled in medical
assistance that employs or contracts with the community paramedic. The care plan must ensure

   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
  "Section 1. [124D.031] ENROLLMENT                       OPTIONS        FOR      STUDENTS         AT

to a nonpublic school under this section, and upon receiving proof that the student is enrolled in
the nonpublic school, the commissioner shall make quarterly payments to the student's parent
or guardian in an amount equal to the lesser of the state average general education revenue per
pupil unit, calculated without transportation sparsity revenue or the nonpublic school's operating
and debt service cost per pupil that is related to educational programming, as determined by the
commissioner. The total amount of the payments must not exceed the tuition and fees charged
at the nonpublic school or the amount calculated under this subdivision, whichever is less. The
commissioner shall send the check to the nonpublic school and the parent or guardian shall
restrictively endorse the check for the nonpublic school's use.

transportation within the district's borders for a student who enrolls in a nonpublic school under
this section and shall receive transportation funding equal to the actual costs in the current school

agencies or instrumentalities, but only if the portion of the exempt-interest dividends from such

within the taxable year under this chapter and the amount of taxes based on net income paid, sales
and use, motor vehicle sales, or excise taxes paid to any other state or to any province or territory of
Canada, to the extent allowed as a deduction under section 63(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, but
the addition may not be more than the amount by which the itemized deductions as allowed under
section 63(d) of the Internal Revenue Code exceeds the amount of the standard deduction as defined
in section 63(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, disregarding the amounts allowed under sections
63(c)(1)(C) and 63(c)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code, minus any addition that would have been
required under clause (21) if the taxpayer had claimed the standard deduction. For the purpose of this

disallowed;

Internal Revenue Code;
    (7) 80 percent of the depreciation deduction allowed under section 168(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code. For purposes of this clause, if the taxpayer has an activity that in the taxable year
generates a deduction for depreciation under section 168(k) and the activity generates a loss for the
taxable year that the taxpayer is not allowed to claim for the taxable year, "the depreciation allowed
under section 168(k)" for the taxable year is limited to excess of the depreciation claimed by the
activity under section 168(k) over the amount of the loss from the activity that is not allowed in
the taxable year. In succeeding taxable years when the losses not allowed in the taxable year are
allowed, the depreciation under section 168(k) is allowed;

Revenue Code, to the extent deducted from gross income;

63(c)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code;

exemptions claimed by the taxpayer in the computation of federal taxable income multiplied by the
applicable percentage;

   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 245A.03, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 6a. Adult foster care homes serving people with mental illness; certification. (a) The
commissioner of human services shall develop an optional certification process for adult foster care
homes licensed under this chapter and Minnesota Rules, parts 9555.5105 to 9555.6265, that serve
people with mental illness where the home is not the primary residence of the license holder. If an
adult foster care license holder becomes certified, the certification shall be included in the license
information. The certification process shall be developed with input from advocates, mental health
professionals, and adult foster care providers.
   (b) As part of the certification process, the commissioner shall require that:
   (1) staff working in the adult foster care home receive training on the following topics:
   (i) mental health diagnoses;
   (ii) mental health crisis response and de-escalation techniques;
   (iii) recovery from mental illness;
   (iv) treatment options including evidence-based practices;
   (v) medications and their side effects;
   (vi) co-occurring substance abuse and health conditions; and
   (vii) other topics as determined by the commissioner; and
   (2) a mental health professional, as defined in section 245.462, subdivision 18, provides
oversight of the adult foster care home.
   (c) The commissioner shall develop certification requirements by January 1, 2013.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 245A.11, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Adult foster care license capacity. (a) The commissioner shall issue adult foster care
licenses with a maximum licensed capacity of four beds, including nonstaff roomers and boarders,
except that the commissioner may issue a license with a capacity of five beds, including roomers
and boarders, according to paragraphs (b) to (f).
    (b) An adult foster care license holder may have a maximum license capacity of five if all persons
in care are age 55 or over and do not have a serious and persistent mental illness or a developmental
disability.
    (c) The commissioner may grant variances to paragraph (b) to allow a foster care provider with a
licensed capacity of five persons to admit an individual under the age of 55 if the variance complies
with section 245A.04, subdivision 9, and approval of the variance is recommended by the county
in which the licensed foster care provider is located.
    (d) The commissioner may grant variances to paragraph (b) to allow the use of a fifth bed for
emergency crisis services for a person with serious and persistent mental illness or a developmental
disability, regardless of age, if the variance complies with section 245A.04, subdivision 9, and

approval of the variance is recommended by the county in which the licensed foster care provider
is located.
     (e) The commissioner may grant a variance to paragraph (b) to allow for the use of a fifth bed
for respite services, as defined in section 245A.02, for persons with disabilities, regardless of age, if
the variance complies with section 245A.03, subdivision 7, and section 245A.04, subdivision 9, and
approval of the variance is recommended by the county in which the licensed foster care provider
is licensed. Respite care may be provided under the following conditions:
    (1) staffing ratios cannot be reduced below the approved level for the individuals being served
in the home on a permanent basis;
  (2) no more than two different individuals can be accepted for respite services in any calendar
month and the total respite days may not exceed 120 days per program in any calendar year;
    (3) the person receiving respite services must have his or her bedroom, which could be used for
alternative purposes when not used as a respite bedroom, and cannot be the room of another person
who lives in the foster care home; and
    (4) individuals living in the foster care home must be notified when the variance is approved.
The provider must give 60 days' notice in writing to the residents and their legal representatives
prior to accepting the first respite placement. Notice must be given to residents at least two days
prior to service initiation, or as soon as the license holder is able if they receive notice of the need
for respite less than two days prior to initiation, each time a respite client will be served, unless the
requirement for this notice is waived by the resident or legal guardian.

of technology, is specified for each resident in the resident's: (i) individualized plan of care; (ii)
individual service plan under section 256B.092, subdivision 1b, if required; or (iii) individual
resident placement agreement under Minnesota Rules, part 9555.5105, subpart 19, if required.
   (b) To be eligible for a variance under paragraph (a), the adult foster care license holder must not

sanction issued under 245A.07 during the prior 24 months based on failure to provide adequate
supervision, health care services, or resident safety in the adult foster care home.
    (c) A license holder requesting a variance under this subdivision to utilize technology as a
component of a plan for alternative overnight supervision may request the commissioner's review
in the absence of a county recommendation. Upon receipt of such a request from a license holder,
the commissioner shall review the variance request with the county.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 245A.11, subdivision 7a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7a. Alternate overnight supervision technology; adult foster care license. (a) The
commissioner may grant an applicant or license holder an adult foster care license for a residence that
does not have a caregiver in the residence during normal sleeping hours as required under Minnesota
Rules, part 9555.5105, subpart 37, item B, but uses monitoring technology to alert the license holder
when an incident occurs that may jeopardize the health, safety, or rights of a foster care recipient.
The applicant or license holder must comply with all other requirements under Minnesota Rules,
parts 9555.5105 to 9555.6265, and the requirements under this subdivision. The license printed by
the commissioner must state in bold and large font:
   (1) that the facility is under electronic monitoring; and
   (2) the telephone number of the county's common entry point for making reports of suspected
maltreatment of vulnerable adults under section 626.557, subdivision 9.

    (b) Applications for a license under this section must be submitted directly to the Department of
Human Services licensing division. The licensing division must immediately notify the host county
and lead county contract agency and the host county licensing agency. The licensing division must
collaborate with the county licensing agency in the review of the application and the licensing of
the program.
    (c) Before a license is issued by the commissioner, and for the duration of the license, the
applicant or license holder must establish, maintain, and document the implementation of written
policies and procedures addressing the requirements in paragraphs (d) through (f).
   (d) The applicant or license holder must have policies and procedures that:
   (1) establish characteristics of target populations that will be admitted into the home, and
characteristics of populations that will not be accepted into the home;
   (2) explain the discharge process when a foster care recipient requires overnight supervision or
other services that cannot be provided by the license holder due to the limited hours that the license
holder is on site;
   (3) describe the types of events to which the program will respond with a physical presence
when those events occur in the home during time when staff are not on site, and how the license
holder's response plan meets the requirements in paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2);
    (4) establish a process for documenting a review of the implementation and effectiveness
of the response protocol for the response required under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2). The
documentation must include:
   (i) a description of the triggering incident;
   (ii) the date and time of the triggering incident;
   (iii) the time of the response or responses under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2);
   (iv) whether the response met the resident's needs;
   (v) whether the existing policies and response protocols were followed; and
   (vi) whether the existing policies and protocols are adequate or need modification.
    When no physical presence response is completed for a three-month period, the license holder's
written policies and procedures must require a physical presence response drill to be conducted
for which the effectiveness of the response protocol under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2), will be
reviewed and documented as required under this clause; and
    (5) establish that emergency and nonemergency phone numbers are posted in a prominent
location in a common area of the home where they can be easily observed by a person responding
to an incident who is not otherwise affiliated with the home.
    (e) The license holder must document and include in the license application which response
alternative under clause (1) or (2) is in place for responding to situations that present a serious risk
to the health, safety, or rights of people receiving foster care services in the home:
   (1) response alternative (1) requires only the technology to provide an electronic notification or
4204                                  JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                       [83RD DAY

alert to the license holder that an event is underway that requires a response. Under this alternative,
no more than ten minutes will pass before the license holder will be physically present on site to
respond to the situation; or
    (2) response alternative (2) requires the electronic notification and alert system under alternative
(1), but more than ten minutes may pass before the license holder is present on site to respond to
the situation. Under alternative (2), all of the following conditions are met:
    (i) the license holder has a written description of the interactive technological applications that
will assist the license holder in communicating with and assessing the needs related to the care,
health, and safety of the foster care recipients. This interactive technology must permit the license
holder to remotely assess the well being of the foster care recipient without requiring the initiation
of the foster care recipient. Requiring the foster care recipient to initiate a telephone call does not
meet this requirement;
    (ii) the license holder documents how the remote license holder is qualified and capable of
meeting the needs of the foster care recipients and assessing foster care recipients' needs under
item (i) during the absence of the license holder on site;
    (iii) the license holder maintains written procedures to dispatch emergency response personnel
to the site in the event of an identified emergency; and
    (iv) each foster care recipient's individualized plan of care, individual service plan under section
256B.092, subdivision 1b, if required, or individual resident placement agreement under Minnesota
Rules, part 9555.5105, subpart 19, if required, identifies the maximum response time, which may
be greater than ten minutes, for the license holder to be on site for that foster care recipient.

that the adult foster care license category is a program without the presence of a caregiver in the
residence during normal sleeping hours; the protocols in place for responding to situations that
present a serious risk to the health, safety, or rights of foster care recipients under paragraph (e),
clause (1) or (2); and a signed informed consent from each foster care recipient or the person's legal
representative documenting the person's or legal representative's agreement with placement in the
program. If electronic monitoring technology is used in the home, the informed consent form must
also explain the following:
    (1) how any electronic monitoring is incorporated into the alternative supervision system;
   (2) the backup system for any electronic monitoring in times of electrical outages or other
equipment malfunctions;
                l­c

    (4) the event types and license holder response times established under paragraph (e);
   (5) how the license holder protects the foster care recipient's privacy related to electronic
monitoring and related to any electronically recorded data generated by the monitoring system.
A foster care recipient may not be removed from a program under this subdivision for failure to
consent to electronic monitoring. The consent form must explain where and how the electronically
recorded data is stored, with whom it will be shared, and how long it is retained; and

   (6) the risks and benefits of the alternative overnight supervision system.
    The written explanations under clauses (1) to (6) may be accomplished through cross-references
to other policies and procedures as long as they are explained to the person giving consent, and the
person giving consent is offered a copy.
    (g) Nothing in this section requires the applicant or license holder to develop or maintain separate
or duplicative policies, procedures, documentation, consent forms, or individual plans that may be
required for other licensing standards, if the requirements of this section are incorporated into those
documents.
    (h) The commissioner may grant variances to the requirements of this section according to
section 245A.04, subdivision 9.
    (i) For the purposes of paragraphs (d) through (h), "license holder" has the meaning under section
245A.2, subdivision 9, and additionally includes all staff, volunteers, and contractors affiliated with
the license holder.
    (j) For the purposes of paragraph (e), the terms "assess" and "assessing" mean to remotely
determine what action the license holder needs to take to protect the well-being of the foster care
recipient.
    (k) The commissioner shall evaluate license applications using the requirements in paragraphs
(d) to (f). The commissioner shall provide detailed application forms, including a checklist of criteria
needed for approval.
    (l) To be eligible for a license under paragraph (a), the adult foster care license holder must not
have had a conditional license issued under section 245A.06 or any licensing sanction under section
245A.07 during the prior 24 months based on failure to provide adequate supervision, health care
services, or resident safety in the adult foster care home.
    (m) The commissioner shall review an application for an alternative overnight supervision
license within 60 days of receipt of the application. When the commissioner receives an application
that is incomplete because the applicant failed to submit required documents or that is substantially
deficient because the documents submitted do not meet licensing requirements, the commissioner
shall provide the applicant written notice that the application is incomplete or substantially
deficient. In the written notice to the applicant, the commissioner shall identify documents that
are missing or deficient and give the applicant 45 days to resubmit a second application that is
substantially complete. An applicant's failure to submit a substantially complete application after
receiving notice from the commissioner is a basis for license denial under section 245A.05. The
commissioner shall complete subsequent review within 30 days.
   (n) Once the application is considered complete under paragraph (m), the commissioner will
approve or deny an application for an alternative overnight supervision license within 60 days.
   (o) For the purposes of this subdivision, "supervision" means:
   (1) oversight by a caregiver as specified in the individual resident's place agreement and
awareness of the resident's needs and activities; and
   (2) the presence of a caregiver in a residence during normal sleeping hours, unless a

determination has been made and documented in the individual's support plan that the individual
does not require the presence of a caregiver during normal sleeping hours.

holders licensed under this chapter are exempt from sections 245A.65, subdivision 2, and 626.557,
subdivision 14, if the requirements of this subdivision are met.
   (b) The risk management plan must identify areas in which the consumer is vulnerable, based
on an assessment, at a minimum, of the following areas:
    (1) an adult consumer's susceptibility to physical, emotional, and sexual abuse as defined
in section 626.5572, subdivision 2, and financial exploitation as defined in section 626.5572,
subdivision 9; a minor consumer's susceptibility to sexual and physical abuse as defined in section
626.556, subdivision 2; and a consumer's susceptibility to self-abuse, regardless of age;

or coercion, as defined under section 245B.02, subdivision 10, clauses (6) and (7), between
consumers, or towards others. Under this clause, a license holder knows of a consumer's history of
criminal misconduct or physical aggression if it receives such information from a law enforcement
authority, through a medical record prepared by a health care provider, or the license holder's
ongoing assessments of the consumer.
   (c) When assessing a consumer's vulnerability, the license holder must consider only the
consumer's skills and abilities, independent of staffing patterns, supervision plans, the environment,
or other situational elements. License holders jointly providing services to a consumer shall
coordinate and use the resulting assessment of risk areas for the development of each license
holder's risk management or the shared risk management plan.

   (1) high protein diet, at least 80 grams daily, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (2) controlled protein diet, 40 to 60 grams and requires special products, 100 percent of thrifty

    (c) A fee for guardian or conservator service is allowed at a reasonable rate negotiated by the
county or approved by the court. This rate shall not exceed five percent of the assistance unit's gross
monthly income up to a maximum of $100 per month. If the guardian or conservator is a member
of the county agency staff, no fee is allowed.
    (d) The county agency shall continue to pay a monthly allowance of $68 for restaurant meals for
a person who was receiving a restaurant meal allowance on June 1, 1990, and who eats two or more

percent of the assistance unit's gross income before the application of this special needs standard.
"Gross income" for the purposes of this section is the applicant's or recipient's income as defined
in section 256D.35, subdivision 10, or the standard specified in subdivision 3, paragraph (a) or (b),
whichever is greater. A recipient of a federal or state housing subsidy, that limits shelter costs to a
percentage of gross income, shall not be considered shelter needy for purposes of this paragraph.
     (g) Notwithstanding this subdivision, to access housing and services as provided in paragraph
(f), the recipient may choose housing that may be owned, operated, or controlled by the recipient's
service provider. In a multifamily building o          ­­f­­

    Subd. 2. Unemployment benefits paid from state funds. Unemployment benefits are paid from
state funds and are not considered paid from any special insurance plan, nor as paid by an employer.
An application for unemployment benefits is not considered a claim against an employer but is
considered a request for unemployment benefits from the trust fund. The commissioner has the
responsibility for the proper payment of unemployment benefits regardless of the level of interest
or participation by an applicant or an employer in any determination or appeal. An applicant's
entitlement to unemployment benefits must be determined based upon that information available

not binding on the commissioner in determining an applicant's entitlement. There is no presumption

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 260B.163, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Appointment of counsel. (a) The child, parent, guardian or custodian has the right to
effective assistance of counsel in connection with a proceeding in juvenile court. This right does
not apply to a child who is charged with a juvenile petty offense as defined in section 260B.007,
subdivision 16, unless the child is charged with a third or subsequent juvenile alcohol or controlled
substance offense and may be subject to the alternative disposition described in section 260B.235,
subdivision 6.
    (b) The court shall appoint counsel, or standby counsel if the child waives the right to counsel,
for a child who is:
   (1) charged by delinquency petition with a gross misdemeanor or felony offense; or
   (2) the subject of a delinquency proceeding in which out-of-home placement has been proposed.
    (c) If they desire counsel but are unable to employ it, the court shall appoint counsel to
represent the child or the parents or guardian in any case in which it feels that such an appointment
is appropriate, except a juvenile petty offender who does not have the right to counsel under
paragraph (a). If the court appoints standby or advisory counsel, the cost of counsel shall be paid
for by the Office of the State Court Administrator with state funds or, if the prosecutor requests
the appointment, by the governmental unit conducting the prosecution. In no event may the court
order the Board of Public Defense to pay the cost of standby or advisory counsel.
   (d) Counsel for the child shall not also act as the child's guardian ad litem.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 260B.331, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
     Subd. 5. Attorneys fees. (a) In proceedings in which the court has appointed counsel pursuant
to section 260B.163, subdivision 4, for a minor unable to employ counsel, the court m     ­­ ­ shall

    (b) The court may order a parent, guardian, or custodian who is employed when counsel
is appointed, or who becomes employed while represented by appointed counsel, or who is or
becomes able to make partial payments for appointed counsel, to reimburse the state for the cost
of appointed counsel. If reimbursement is required under this subdivision, the court shall order the
reimbursement when counsel is first appointed or as soon as possible after the court determines that
reimbursement is required. The court may accept partial reimbursement from a parent, guardian, or
custodian if their financial circumstances warrant a reduced reimbursement schedule. If a parent,
guardian, or custodian does not agree to make payments, the court may order their respective
employer to withhold a percentage of their respective income to be turned over to the court. In
determining the percentage to be withheld, the court shall consider the income and assets of the
parent, guardian, or custodian.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 260C.163, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Appointment of counsel. (a) The child, parent, guardian or custodian has the right to
effective assistance of counsel in connection with a proceeding in juvenile court as provided in this
subdivision.

   (d) Counsel for the child shall not also act as the child's guardian ad litem.
    (e) In any proceeding where the subject of a petition for a child in need of protection or services
is not represented by an attorney, the court shall determine the child's preferences regarding the
proceedings, if the child is of suitable age to express a preference.
    (f) Court-appointed counsel for the parent, guardian, or custodian under this subdivision is at
county expense. The court shall appoint only one counsel at public expense to jointly represent the
interests of the parent, guardian, and custodian subject to the jurisdiction of the court unless, upon
petition of a party, the court determines and makes written findings on the record that extraordinary
circumstances exist that require counsel to be appointed to represent a separate interest of other
parents, guardians, or custodians subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. The court shall
appoint counsel retained by the county to provide representation in juvenile court proceedings unless
the court finds there is a conflict of interest. Upon a finding of conflict of interest, the county shall
contract with competent counsel to provide the necessary representation. The county board must
consult with the chief judge of the judicial district or the judge's designee before retaining counsel
under this paragraph.
    (g) Counsel retained by the county under paragraph (f) must meet the qualifications established
by the Judicial Council in at least one of the following: (1) has a minimum of two years' experience
handling child protection cases; (2) has training in handling child protection cases from a course
or courses approved by the Judicial Council; or (3) is supervised by an attorney who meets the
minimum qualifications under clause (1) or (2).

counsel for the cost of appointed counsel. If reimbursement is required under this subdivision, the
court shall order the reimbursement when counsel is first appointed or as soon as possible after the
court determines that reimbursement is required. The court may accept partial reimbursement from

schedule. If a parent, guardian, or custodian does not agree to make payments, the court may order
their respective employer to withhold a percentage of their respective income to be turned over to

disclose confidential sources of information unless the court otherwise directs. On the request of
the prosecuting attorney or the defendant's attorney a summary hearing in chambers shall be held
on any matter brought in issue, but confidential sources of information shall not be disclosed unless
the court otherwise directs. If the presentence report is given orally the defendant or the defendant's
attorney shall be permitted to hear the report.
    (b) Any report made under subdivision 1 or 2 shall be provided to counsel for the defendant
for purposes of representing the defendant on any appeal or petition for postconviction relief. The
reports shall be provided by the court and the commissioner of corrections at no cost to the defendant
or the defendant's attorney.
    Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 609.131, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
     Subdivision 1. General rule. Except as provided in subdivision 2, an alleged misdemeanor
violation must be treated as a petty misdemeanor if the prosecuting attorney believes that it is in
the interest of justice that the defendant not be imprisoned if convicted and certifies that belief to
the court at or before the time of arraignment or pretrial hearing, and the court approves of the
certification motion. Prior to the appointment of a public defender to represent a defendant charged
with a misdemeanor, the court shall inquire of the prosecutor whether the prosecutor intends to
certify the case as a petty misdemeanor. The defendant's consent to the certification is not required.

   611.17 FINANCIAL INQUIRY; STATEMENTS; CO-PAYMENT; STANDARDS FOR
DISTRICT PUBLIC DEFENSE ELIGIBILITY.
   (a) Each judicial district must screen requests for representation by the district public defender.
A defendant is financially unable to obtain counsel if:
   (1) the defendant, or any dependent of the defendant who resides in the same household as the
defendant, receives means-tested governmental benefits; or
    (2) the court determines that the defendant, through any combination of liquid assets and current
income, would be unable to pay the reasonable costs charged by private counsel in that judicial
district for a defense of the same matter.
     (b) Upon a request for the appointment of counsel, the court shall make an appropriate ­n                           i­q

83RD DAY]                                            THURSDAY, MARCH 8, 2012                                                                          4231

the financial statement or refuses to provide information necessary to determine financial eligibility
under this section, or waives the appointment of a public defender under section 611.19.
    An inquiry to determine financial eligibility of a defendant for the appointment of the district
public defender shall be made whenever possible prior to the court appearance and by such persons
as the court may direct. This inquiry may be combined with the prerelease investigation provided
for in Minnesota Rule of Criminal Procedure 6.02, subdivision 3. In no case shall the district public
defender be required to perform this inquiry or investigate the defendant's assets or eligibility. The
court has the sole duty to conduct a financial inquiry. The inquiry must include the following:
      (1) the liquidity of real estate assets, including the defendant's homestead;
      (2) any assets that can be readily converted to cash or used to secure a debt;
      (3) the determination of whether the transfer of an asset is voidable as a fraudulent conveyance;
and
    (4) the value of all property transfers occurring on or after the date of the alleged offense. The
burden is on the accused to show that the accused is financially unable to afford counsel. Defendants
who fail to provide information necessary to determine eligibility shall be deemed ineligible. The
court must not appoint the district public defender as advisory counsel or standby counsel. If the
court appoints advisory or standby counsel, the cost of counsel shall be paid for by the Office of the
State Court Administrator or, if the prosecutor requests the appointment, by the governmental unit
conducting the prosecution. In no event may the court order the Board of Public Defense to pay the
cost of advisory or standby counsel.
   (c) Upon disposition of the case, an individual who has received public defender services shall
pay to the court a $75 co-payment for representation provided by a public defender, unless the
co-payment is, or has been, reduced in part or waived by the court.
    The co-payment must be credited to the general fund. If a term of probation is imposed as a part
of an offender's sentence, the co-payment required by this section must not be made a condition
of probation. The co-payment required by this section is a civil obligation and must not be made a
condition of a criminal sentence.

provided in this section. Prior to any court appearance, a public defender may represent a person
accused of violating the law, who appears to be financially unable to obtain counsel, and shall
continue to represent the person unless it is subsequently determined that the person is financially
able to obtain counsel. The representation may be made available at the discretion of the public
defender, upon the request of the person or someone on the person's behalf. Any law enforcement
officer may notify the public defender of the arrest of any such person.
    Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 611.20, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
     Subd. 4. Employed defendants; ability to pay. (a) A court shall order a defendant who is
employed when a public defender is appointed, or who becomes employed while represented by
a public defender, or who is or becomes able to make partial payments for counsel, to reimburse
the state for the cost of the public defender. If reimbursement is required under this subdivision,
the court shall order the reimbursement when a public defender is first appointed or as soon as
possible after the court determines that reimbursement is required. The court may accept partial
reimbursement from the defendant if the defendant's financial circumstances warrant a reduced
reimbursement schedule. T      ­h ­­

    (a) The commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency and the commissioner of natural
resources may jointly conduct a pilot program for an alternative form of environmental review as
specified in this section. This pilot program is in addition to the alternate forms of environmental
review that are authorized under Minnesota Statutes, section 116D.04, subdivision 4a. Minnesota
Rules, part 4410.3600, does not apply to the pilot program authorized in this section.
    (b) The commissioners may select up to three projects to be processed under the pilot program.
The environmental review work for each project must commence before January 1, 2014, to remain
eligible for proceeding under this program.
   (c) The pilot program procedures are as follows:
   (1) an environmental assessment worksheet is not required;
    (2) a scoping document must be prepared that identifies the issues to be analyzed, the alternatives
to be considered, and the studies to be undertaken. The scoping document results must be published
at the same time as the notice of preparation of the environmental impact statement;
4250                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [83RD DAY

    (3) any person may submit written comments within 20 days of publication of the notice
for preparation of the environmental impact statement. The responsible governmental unit must
consider modifying the scope of the project based on the comments;
    (4) the environmental impact statement must be an analytical, rather than an encyclopedic,
document that describes the proposed action in detail, analyzes the action's significant environmental
impacts, discusses appropriate alternatives to the proposed action and the alternatives' impacts, and
explores methods by which adverse environmental impacts of an action could be mitigated. The
environmental impact statement must also analyze those economic, employment, and sociological
effects that cannot be avoided should the action be implemented;
    (5) if an impact analysis is needed for permitting, the impact analysis may be summarized for
inclusion in the draft environmental impact statement rather than the full modeling and analysis
being contained within the draft environmental impact statement. An impact analysis must identify
the regulatory requirements, types of impact, and mitigation methods; and
    (6) the responsible governmental unit must follow the procedural notice requirements for a draft
environmental impact statement, final environmental impact statement, and notice of determination
of adequacy for an environmental impact statement.
    (d) A project proposed to be processed under the pilot program must meet all of the following
criteria:
   (1) the project meets or exceeds the threshold of a project requiring a mandatory environmental
impact statement;
   (2) if a combustion source is part of the project, natural gas is the only fuel;
   (3) the project does not have any known projected drawdown effect on private wells;
   (4) Class I air modeling demonstrates that the project will not cause adverse impacts; and
   (5) the project is subject to Code of Federal Regulations, title 40, section 52.21, and the reviews
required for a PSD (prevention of significant deterioration) permit, including control technology,
ambient air, and Class I area impact analysis.
   (e) A project may not be processed under the pilot program if the project:
   (1) requires a federal environmental impact statement;
   (2) is for mining metallic minerals by open pit or underground methods or is a new facility for
processing metallic minerals mined by open pit or underground methods;
   (3) is for mining nonferrous metallic minerals or is a new facility for processing nonferrous
metallic minerals;
   (4) is located in a karst area; or
   (5) would result in a direct discharge of process water to surface water.
   (f) For the selected projects, the responsible governmental unit must prepare the environmental
impact statement according to this section. Notwithstanding Minnesota Statutes, section 116D.04,
subdivision 2a, paragraph (i), the proposers of the specific project selected for the pilot program

may not prepare or submit a preliminary draft environmental impact statement.
    (g) The proposers are subject to the assessment of reasonable costs as provided in Minnesota
Statutes, section 116D.045.

the outcomes of the pilot program and include any recommendations for statute or rule changes.

for a project requiring multiple permits for which two or more agencies' decision processes
include either mandatory or discretionary hearings before a hearing officer prior to the agencies'
decision on the permit, the agencies may, notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, conduct
such hearings in a single consolidated hearing process if requested by the proposer. All agencies
having jurisdiction over a permit that is included in the consolidated hearing shall participate. The
responsible governmental unit shall establish appropriate procedures for the consolidated hearing
process, including procedures to ensure that the consolidated hearing process is consistent with the
applicable requirements for each permit regarding the rights and duties of parties to the hearing,
and shall utilize the earliest applicable hearing procedure to initiate the hearing. The procedures of
section 116C.28, subdivision 2, shall apply to the consolidated hearing."

   Subd. 3. Water supply plans; demand reduction. (a) Every public water supplier serving more
than 1,000 people must submit a water supply plan to the commissioner for approval by January 1,

    (b) The water supply plan in paragraph (a) is required for all communities in the metropolitan
area, as defined in section 473.121, with a municipal water supply system and is a required element

specific deficiencies in writing and the applicant then has 20 business days to address the deficiencies
to the commissioner's satisfaction. After the 20 business days expire, the commissioner has 15
business days to make a final decision to approve or disapprove the application. Failing to address

full five-year term.

application period.
     (f) If the governing board of an approved authorizer that has chartered multiple schools votes
to withdraw as an approved authorizer for a reason unrelated to any cause under subdivision 23,
the authorizer must notify all its chartered schools and the commissioner in writing by July 15 of
its intent to withdraw as an authorizer on June 30 in the next calendar year. The commissioner
may approve the transfer of a charter school to a new authorizer under this paragraph after the new
authorizer submits an affidavit to the commissioner.
   (g) The authorizer must participate in department-approved training.
    (h) An authorizer that chartered a school before August 1, 2009, must apply by June 30, 2012, to

to charter a school.
    (i) The commissioner shall review an authorizer's performance every five years in a manner and
form determined by the commissioner and may review an authorizer's performance more frequently
at the commissioner's own initiative or at the request of a charter school operator, charter school
board member, or other interested party. The commissioner, after completing the review, shall
transmit a report with findings to the authorizer. If, consistent with this section, the commissioner
finds that an authorizer has not fulfilled the requirements of this section, the commissioner may
subject the authorizer to corrective action, which may include terminating the contract with the
charter school board of directors of a school it chartered. The commissioner must notify the
authorizer in writing of any findings that may subject the authorizer to corrective action and the
authorizer then has 15 business days to request an informal hearing before the commissioner takes
corrective action. If the commissioner terminates a contract between an authorizer and a charter
school under this paragraph, the commissioner may assist the charter school in acquiring a new
authorizer.
    (j) The commissioner may at any time take corrective action against an authorizer, including
terminating an authorizer's ability to charter a school for:
   (1) failing to demonstrate the criteria under paragraph (c) under which the commissioner
approved the authorizer;

    (2) violating a term of the chartering contract between the authorizer and the charter school board
