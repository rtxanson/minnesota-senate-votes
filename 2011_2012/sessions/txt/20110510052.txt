subtraction allowed under section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clauses (11) and (14), is less than the
filing requirements for a single individual who is a full-year resident of Minnesota.
     (b) The decedent's final income tax return, and other income tax returns for prior years where
the decedent had gross income in excess of the minimum amount at which an individual is required
to file and did not file, must be filed by the decedent's personal representative, if any. If there is no
personal representative, the return or returns must be filed by the transferees, as defined in section
270C.58, subdivision 3, who receive property of the decedent.

   (c) The term "gross income," as it is used in this section, has the same meaning given it in section
290.01, subdivision 20.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2010.
    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.08, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7. Composite income tax returns for nonresident partners, shareholders, and
beneficiaries. (a) The commissioner may allow a partnership with nonresident partners to file a
composite return and to pay the tax on behalf of nonresident partners who have no other Minnesota
source income. This composite return must include the names, addresses, Social Security numbers,
income allocation, and tax liability for the nonresident partners electing to be covered by the
composite return.
    (b) The computation of a partner's tax liability must be determined by multiplying the income
allocated to that partner by the highest rate used to determine the tax liability for individuals
under section 290.06, subdivision 2c. Nonbusiness deductions, standard deductions, or personal
exemptions are not allowed.
    (c) The partnership must submit a request to use this composite return filing method for
nonresident partners. The requesting partnership must file a composite return in the form prescribed
by the commissioner of revenue. The filing of a composite return is considered a request to use the
composite return filing method.
    (d) The electing partner must not have any Minnesota source income other than the income from
the partnership and other electing partnerships. If it is determined that the electing partner has other
Minnesota source income, the inclusion of the income and tax liability for that partner under this
provision will not constitute a return to satisfy the requirements of subdivision 1. The tax paid for
the individual as part of the composite return is allowed as a payment of the tax by the individual
on the date on which the composite return payment was made. If the electing nonresident partner
has no other Minnesota source income, filing of the composite return is a return for purposes of
subdivision 1.
     (e) This subdivision does not negate the requirement that an individual pay estimated tax if
the individual's liability would exceed the requirements set forth in section 289A.25. A                      ­­­­

partnership pays composite estimated tax in the manner prescribed in section 289A.25.
    (f) If an electing partner's share of the partnership's gross income from Minnesota sources is
less than the filing requirements for a nonresident under this subdivision, the tax liability is zero.
However, a statement showing the partner's share of gross income must be included as part of the
composite return.
    (g) The election provided in this subdivision is only available to a partner who has no other
Minnesota source income and who is either (1) a full-year nonresident individual or (2) a trust or
estate that does not claim a deduction under either section 651 or 661 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (h) A corporation defined in section 290.9725 and its nonresident shareholders may make an
election under this paragraph. The provisions covering the partnership apply to the corporation and

the provisions applying to the partner apply to the shareholder.
    (i) Estates and trusts distributing current income only and the nonresident individual
beneficiaries of the estates or trusts may make an election under this paragraph. The provisions
covering the partnership apply to the estate or trust. The provisions applying to the partner apply to
the beneficiary.
     (j) For the purposes of this subdivision, "income" means the partner's share of federal adjusted
gross income from the partnership modified by the additions provided in section 290.01, subdivision
19a, clauses (6) to (10), and the subtractions provided in: (i) section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clause
(8), to the extent the amount is assignable or allocable to Minnesota under section 290.17; and
(ii) section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clause (13). The subtraction allowed under section 290.01,
subdivision 19b, clause (8), is only allowed on the composite tax computation to the extent the
electing partner would have been allowed the subtraction.

   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.12, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 17. Third-party payers of sick pay benefits. (a) A third-party payer of sick pay benefits
who withholds income tax from the sick pay of an employee as agent for the employer of the
employee, and who remits that withholding tax to the commissioner must file an annual report on
a form prescribed by the commissioner. The report must include the name and tax identification
number of each employer for whom the payer has made sick pay payments and the name, Social
Security number, amount of sick pay paid, and amount of tax withheld for each employee.
    (b) The report must be filed with the commissioner on or before February 28 of the year following
the year in which the sick pay benefits were paid.
    (c) The report required by this subdivision does not need to be filed if the third-party payer,
rather than the employer, has provided to the employee the annual statement required under section
289A.09, subdivision 2, that includes the sick pay benefits paid and the tax withheld.

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.25, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Requirements to pay. An individual, trust, S corporation, or partnership must,
when prescribed in subdivision 3, paragraph (b), make payments of estimated tax. For individuals,
the term "estimated tax" means the amount the taxpayer estimates is the sum of the taxes imposed
by chapter 290 for the taxable year. For trusts, S corporations, and partnerships, the term estimated
tax means the amount the taxpayer estimates is the sum of the taxes for the taxable year imposed
by chapter 290 and the composite income tax imposed by section 289A.08, subdivision 7. If the
individual is an infant or incompetent person, the payments must be made by the individual's
guardian. If joint payments on estimated tax are made but a joint return is not made for the taxable
year, the estimated tax for that year may be treated as the estimated tax of either the husband or the
wife or may be divided between them.
    Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, no payments of estimated tax are required if the
estimated tax, as defined in this subdivision, less the credits allowed against the tax, is less than

   (b) For trusts, S corporations, and partnerships, if in any previous taxable year the entity was
subject to taxation under chapter 290 or composite income tax is elected under section 289A.08,
subdivision 7, then an addition to the tax is imposed under this section. In all other taxable years,
no addition to tax is imposed under this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2010.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.25, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

before the 15th day of the third, sixth, ninth, and final month of the short taxable year, to the extent
applicable based on the number of months in the short taxable year.
    (b) A trust, S corporation, or partnership is not required to make estimated tax payments for a
short taxable year unless its tax liability before the first day of the last month of the taxable year can
reasonably be expected to exceed $500.
    (c) No payment is required by a trust, S corporation, or partnership for a short taxable year of
less than four months.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,

(excluding section 290.92 and an S corporation under section 290.9725) or an entity subject to
taxation under section 290.05, subdivision 3, must make payment of estimated tax for the taxable
year if its tax liability so computed can reasonably be expected to exceed $500, or in accordance
with rules prescribed by the commissioner for an affiliated group of corporations filing one return
under section 289A.08, subdivision 3.

   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290.92, subdivision 26, is amended to read:
    Subd. 26. Extension of withholding to certain payments where identifying number not
furnished or inaccurate. (a) If, in the case of any reportable payment, (1) the payee fails to furnish
the payee's Social Security account number to the payor, (2) the payee is subject to federal backup
withholding on the reportable payment under section 3406 of the Internal Revenue Code, or (3) the
commissioner notifies the payor that the Social Security account number furnished by the payee is
incorrect, then the payor shall deduct and withhold from the payment a tax equal to the amount
of the payment multiplied by the highest rate used in determining the income tax liability of an
individual under section 290.06, subdivision 2c.
    (b)(1) In the case of any failure described in clause (a)(1), clause (a) shall apply to any reportable
payment made by the payor during the period during which the Social Security account number has

    (2) In any case where there is a notification described in clause (a)(3), clause (a) shall apply
to any reportable payment made by the payor (i) after the close of the 30th day after the day on
which the payor received the notification, and (ii) before the payee furnishes another Social Security
account number.
    (3)(i) Unless the payor elects not to have this subparagraph apply with respect to the payee,
clause (a) shall also apply to any reportable payment made after the close of the period described in
paragraph (1) or (2) (as the case may be) and before the 30th day after the close of the period.
     (ii) If the payor elects the application of this subparagraph with respect to the payee, clause (a)
shall also apply to any reportable payment made during the 30-day period described in paragraph
(2).
     (iii) The payor may elect a period shorter than the grace period set forth in subparagraph (i) or
(ii) as the case may be.
    (c) The provisions of section 3406 of the Internal Revenue Code shall apply and shall govern
when withholding shall be required and the definition of terms. The term "reportable payment"
shall include only those payments for personal services, including payments subject to withholding
under subdivision 31. No tax shall be deducted or withheld under this subdivision with respect to
any amount for which withholding is otherwise required under this section. For purposes of this
section, payments which are subject to withholding under this subdivision shall be treated as if they
were wages paid by an employer to an employee and amounts deducted and withheld under this
subdivision shall be treated as if deducted and withheld under subdivision 2a.
    (d) Whenever the commissioner notifies a payor under this subdivision that the Social Security
account number furnished by any payee is incorrect, the commissioner shall at the same time furnish
a copy of the notice to the payor, and the payor shall promptly furnish the copy to the payee. If
the commissioner notifies a payor under this subdivision that the Social Security account number
furnished by any payee is incorrect and the payee subsequently furnishes another Social Security
account number to the payor, the payor shall promptly notify the commissioner of the other Social
Security account number furnished.

    (c) Agricultural property that is owned by a member, partner, or shareholder of a family farm
corporation or joint family farm venture, limited liability company operating a family farm, or by

52ND DAY]                           TUESDAY, MAY 10, 2011                                        1861

   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.13, subdivision 23, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23. Class 2. (a) An agricultural homestead consists of class 2a agricultural land that is
homesteaded, along with any class 2b rural vacant land that is contiguous to the class 2a land under
the same ownership. The market value of the house and garage and immediately surrounding one
acre of land has the same class rates as class 1a or 1b property under subdivision 22. The value of the
remaining land including improvements up to the first tier valuation limit of agricultural homestead
property has a net class rate of 0.5 percent of market value. The remaining property over the first
tier has a class rate of one percent of market value. For purposes of this subdivision, the "first tier
valuation limit of agricultural homestead property" and "first tier" means the limit certified under
section 273.11, subdivision 23.
    (b) Class 2a agricultural land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
agricultural land and buildings. Class 2a property has a net class rate of one percent of market
value, unless it is part of an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a). Class 2a property must
also include any property that would otherwise be classified as 2b, but is interspersed with class
2a property, including but not limited to sloughs, wooded wind shelters, acreage abutting ditches,
ravines, rock piles, land subject to a setback requirement, and other similar land that is impractical
for the assessor to value separately from the rest of the property or that is unlikely to be able to
be sold separately from the rest of the property.
    An assessor may classify the part of a parcel described in this subdivision that is used for
agricultural purposes as class 2a and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use.
    (c) Class 2b rural vacant land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
unplatted real estate, rural in character and not used for agricultural purposes, including land
used for growing trees for timber, lumber, and wood and wood products, that is not improved
with a structure. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
Any parcel of 20 acres or more improved with a structure that is not a minor, ancillary nonresidential
structure must be split-classified, and ten acres must be assigned to the split parcel containing the
structure. Class 2b property has a net class rate of one percent of market value unless it is part of
an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a), or qualifies as class 2c under paragraph (d).
    (d) Class 2c managed forest land consists of no less than 20 and no more than 1,920 acres
statewide per taxpayer that is being managed under a forest management plan that meets the
requirements of chapter 290C, but is not enrolled in the sustainable forest resource management
incentive program. It has a class rate of .65 percent, provided that the owner of the property must
apply to the assessor in order for the property to initially qualify for the reduced rate and provide
the information required by the assessor to verify that the property qualifies for the reduced rate.
If the assessor receives the application and information before May 1 in an assessment year, the
property qualifies beginning with that assessment year. If the assessor receives the application
and information after April 30 in an assessment year, the property may not qualify until the next
assessment year. The commissioner of natural resources must concur that the land is qualified. The
commissioner of natural resources shall annually provide county assessors verification information
on a timely basis. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
   (e) Agricultural land as used in this section means contiguous acreage of which:

    (1) o
        ­­f ten acres or more,
                             ­ were used during the preceding year for agricultural purposes; or
   (2) less than ten acres are used for an intensive livestock confinement operation, but land used
only for pasturing or grazing does not qualify under this clause.
"Agricultural purposes" as used in this section means the raising, cultivation, drying, or storage
of agricultural products for sale, or the storage of machinery or equipment used in support of
agricultural production by the same farm entity. For a property to be classified as agricultural
based only on the drying or storage of agricultural products, the products being dried or stored
must have been produced by the same farm entity as the entity operating the drying or storage
facility. "Agricultural purposes" also includes enrollment in the Reinvest in Minnesota program
under sections 103F.501 to 103F.535 or the federal Conservation Reserve Program as contained in
Public Law 99-198 or a similar state or federal conservation program if the property was classified
as agricultural (i) under this subdivision for the assessment year 2002 or (ii) in the year prior to its
enrollment. Agricultural classification shall not be based upon the market value of any residential
structures on the ­p­

     i­­) for market farming; for purposes of this paragraph, "market farming" means the cultivation
of one or more fruits or vegetables or production of animal or other agricultural products for sale to
local markets by the farmer or an organization with which the farmer is affiliated.
   (g) Land shall be classified as agricultural even if all or a portion of the agricultural use of that
property is the leasing to, or use by another person for agricultural purposes.
    Classification under this subdivision is not determinative for qualifying under section 273.111.
    (h) The property classification under this section supersedes, for property tax purposes only, any
locally administered agricultural policies or land use restrictions that define minimum or maximum
farm acreage.
    (i) The term "agricultural products" as used in this subdivision includes production for sale of:

   (1) livestock, dairy animals, dairy products, poultry and poultry products, fur-bearing animals,
horticultural and nursery stock, fruit of all kinds, vegetables, forage, grains, bees, and apiary
products by the owner;
   (2) fish bred for sale and consumption if the fish breeding occurs on land zoned for agricultural
use;
    (3) the commercial boarding of horses, which may include related horse training and riding
instruction, if the boarding is done on property that is also used for raising pasture to graze horses
or raising or cultivating other agricultural products as defined in clause (1);
    (4) property which is owned and operated by nonprofit organizations used for equestrian
activities, excluding racing;
    (5) game birds and waterfowl bred and raised for use on a shooting preserve licensed under
section 97A.115;
   (6) insects primarily bred to be used as food for animals;
   (7) trees, grown for sale as a crop, including short rotation woody crops, and not sold for timber,
lumber, wood, or wood products; and
   (8) maple syrup taken from trees grown by a person licensed by the Minnesota Department of
Agriculture under chapter 28A as a food processor.
    (j) If a parcel used for agricultural purposes is also used for commercial or industrial purposes,
including but not limited to:
   (1) wholesale and retail sales;
   (2) processing of raw agricultural products or other goods;
   (3) warehousing or storage of processed goods; and
   (4) office facilities for the support of the activities enumerated in clauses (1), (2), and (3),
the assessor shall classify the part of the parcel used for agricultural purposes as class 1b, 2a, or 2b,
whichever is appropriate, and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use. The grading, sorting,
and packaging of raw agricultural products for first sale is considered an agricultural purpose. A
greenhouse or other building where horticultural or nursery products are grown that is also used for
the conduct of retail sales must be classified as agricultural if it is primarily used for the growing
of horticultural or nursery products from seed, cuttings, or roots and occasionally as a showroom
for the retail sale of those products. Use of a greenhouse or building only for the display of already
grown horticultural or nursery products does not qualify as an agricultural purpose.
    (k) The assessor shall determine and list separately on the records the market value of the
homestead dwelling and the one acre of land on which that dwelling is located. If any farm
buildings or structures are located on this homesteaded acre of land, their market value shall not be
included in this separate determination.
  (l) Class 2d airport landing area consists of a landing area or public access area of a privately
owned public use airport. It has a class rate of one percent of market value. To qualify for

classification under this paragraph, a privately owned public use airport must be licensed as a
public airport under section 360.018. For purposes of this paragraph, "landing area" means that part
of a privately owned public use airport properly cleared, regularly maintained, and made available
to the public for use by aircraft and includes runways, taxiways, aprons, and sites upon which are
situated landing or navigational aids. A landing area also includes land underlying both the primary
surface and the approach surfaces that comply with all of the following:
    (i) the land is properly cleared and regularly maintained for the primary purposes of the landing,
taking off, and taxiing of aircraft; but that portion of the land that contains facilities for servicing,
repair, or maintenance of aircraft is not included as a landing area;
   (ii) the land is part of the airport property; and
   (iii) the land is not used for commercial or residential purposes.
The land contained in a landing area under this paragraph must be described and certified by the
commissioner of transportation. The certification is effective until it is modified, or until the airport
or landing area no longer meets the requirements of this paragraph. For purposes of this paragraph,
"public access area" means property used as an aircraft parking ramp, apron, or storage hangar, or
an arrival and departure building in connection with the airport.
    (m) Class 2e consists of land with a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively being
mined and is not otherwise classified as class 2a or 2b, provided that the land is not located in a county
that has elected to opt-out of the aggregate preservation program as provided in section 273.1115,
subdivision 6. It has a class rate of one percent of market value. To qualify for classification under
this paragraph, the property must be at least ten contiguous acres in size and the owner of the property
must record with the county recorder of the county in which the property is located an affidavit
containing:
   (1) a legal description of the property;
   (2) a disclosure that the property contains a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively
being mined but is present on the entire parcel enrolled;
   (3) documentation that the conditional use under the county or local zoning ordinance of this
property is for mining; and
    (4) documentation that a permit has been issued by the local unit of government or the mining
activity is allowed under local ordinance. The disclosure must include a statement from a registered
professional geologist, engineer, or soil scientist delineating the deposit and certifying that it is a
commercial aggregate deposit.
   For purposes of this section and section 273.1115, "commercial aggregate deposit" means a
deposit that will yield crushed stone or sand and gravel that is suitable for use as a construction
aggregate; and "actively mined" means the removal of top soil and overburden in preparation for
excavation or excavation of a commercial deposit.
    (n) When any portion of the property under this subdivision or subdivision 22 begins to be
actively mined, the owner must file a supplemental affidavit within 60 days from the day any
aggregate is removed stating the number of acres of the property that is actively being mined.
The acres actively being mined must be (1) valued and classified under subdivision 24 in the next
52ND DAY]                           TUESDAY, MAY 10, 2011                                      1865

subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource preservation property
tax program under section 273.1115, if the land was enrolled in that program. Copies of the
original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed with the county assessor, the local
zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Land and Minerals.
A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent portion of the property is actively
mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres, even if the actual mining activity
constitutes less than five acres.
   (o) The definitions prescribed by the commissioner under paragraphs (c) and (d) are not rules
and are exempt from the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14, and the provisions in section 14.386
concerning exempt rules do not apply.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.33, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Listing and assessment by commissioner. The personal property, consisting of
the pipeline system of mains, pipes, and equipment attached thereto, of pipeline companies and
others engaged in the operations or business of transporting natural gas, gasoline, crude oil, or
other petroleum products by pipelines, shall be listed with and assessed by the commissioner of
revenue and the values provided to the city or county assessor by order. This subdivision shall not
apply to the assessment of the products transported through the pipelines nor to the lines of local
commercial gas companies engaged primarily in the business of distributing gas to consumers at
retail nor to pipelines used by the owner thereof to supply natural gas or other petroleum products
exclusively for such owner's own consumption and not for resale to others. If more than 85 percent
of the natural gas or other petroleum products actually transported over the pipeline is used for
the owner's own consumption and not for resale to others, then this subdivision shall not apply;
provided, however, that in that event, the pipeline shall be assessed in proportion to the percentage
of gas actually transported over such pipeline that is not used for the owner's own consumption.
On or before August 1, the commissioner shall certify to the auditor of each county, the amount of
such personal property assessment against each company in each district in which such property is
located. If the commissioner determines that the amount of personal property assessment certified
on or before August 1 is in error, the commissioner may issue a corrected certification on or before
October 1.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2012 and thereafter.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.37, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

transmission lines of 69 kv and above located in an unorganized township, and distribution lines,
and equipment attached thereto, having a fixed situs outside the corporate limits of cities except
distribution lines taxed as provided in sections 273.40 and 273.41, shall be listed with and assessed
by the commissioner of revenue in the county where situated and the values provided to the city or
county assessor by order. The commissioner shall assess such property at the percentage of market
value fixed by law; and, on or before August 1, shall certify to the auditor of each county in which
such property is located the amount of the assessment made against each company and person
owning such property. If the commissioner determines that the amount of the assessment certified
on or before August 1 is in error, the commissioner may issue a corrected certification on or before
October 1.

required to be listed and assessed by the commissioner of revenue are recommended values. If the
commissioner provides recommended values, the values must be certified to the auditor of each
county in which the property is located on or before August 1. If the commissioner determines that
the certified recommended value is in error the commissioner may issue a corrected certification on
or before October 1.

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 297A.668, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7a. Other direct mail. (a) Notwithstanding other subdivisions of this section, the
provisions in paragraphs (b) and (c) apply to the sale of other direct mail. "Other direct mail"
means printed material that is direct mail as defined in section 297A.61, subdivision 35, but is
not advertising and promotional direct mail as described in subdivision 7, regardless of whether
advertising and promotional direct mail is included in the same mailing. Other direct mail includes,
but is not limited to:
    (1) direct mail pertaining to a transaction between the purchaser and addressee, where the mail
contains personal information specific to the addressee including, but not limited to, invoices, bills,
statements of account, and payroll advices;
    (2) any legally required mailings including, but not limited to, privacy notices, tax reports, and
stockholder reports; and
  (3) other nonpromotional direct mail delivered to existing or former shareholders, customers,
employees, or agents including, but not limited to, newsletters and informational pieces.
    Other direct mail does not include printed materials that result from developing billing
information or providing any data processing service that is more than incidental to producing the
other direct mail.
    (b) A purchaser of other direct mail may provide the seller with either a fully completed
exemption certificate as described in section 297A.72 indicating that the purchaser is authorized
to pay any sales or use tax due on purchases made by the purchaser directly to the commissioner
under section 297A.89, or a fully completed exemption certificate claiming an exemption for
direct mail. If the purchaser provides one of the exemption certificates listed, then the seller, in the
absence of bad faith, is relieved of all obligations to collect, pay, or remit the tax on any transaction
involving other direct mail to which the certificate applies. The purchaser shall source the sale to
the jurisdictions to which the other direct mail is to be delivered to the recipients of the mail, and
shall report and pay any applicable tax due.
    (c) If the purchaser does not provide the seller with a fully completed exemption certificate
claiming either exemption listed in paragraph (b), the sale shall be sourced according to subdivision
2, paragraph (d).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for sales and purchases made after June 30, 2011.
    Sec. 6. Laws 1986, chapter 462, section 31, as amended by Laws 1991, chapter 291, article 8,

    Notwithstanding Minnesota Statutes, section 477A.016, or any other law, and supplemental to
the tax imposed by Laws 1982, chapter 523, article 25, section 1, the city of St. Paul may impose,
by ordinance, a tax, at a rate not greater than three percent, on the gross receipts from the furnishing

Revenue Code. For purposes of this clause, if the taxpayer has an activity that in the taxable year
generates a deduction for depreciation under section 168(k) and the activity generates a loss for the

activity under section 168(k) over the amount of the loss from the activity that is not allowed in

tax for each bracket shall be computed at the rates set forth in this subdivision, provided that the
commissioner may disregard a fractional part of a dollar unless it amounts to 50 cents or more, in
which case it may be increased to $1.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290.095, subdivision 11, is amended to read:
    Subd. 11. Carryback or carryover adjustments. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c), for
individuals, estates, and trusts the amount of a net operating loss that may be carried back or carried
over shall be the same dollar amount allowable in the determination of federal taxable income,
provided that, notwithstanding any other provision, estates and trusts must apply the following
adjustments to the amount of the net operating loss that may be carried back or carried over:
   (1) Nonassignable income or losses as required by section 290.17.
   (2) Deductions not allocable to Minnesota under section 290.17.
    (b) The net operating loss carryback or carryover applied as a deduction in the taxable year to
which the net operating loss is carried back or carried over shall be equal to the net operating loss
carryback or carryover applied in the taxable year in arriving at federal taxable income provided
that trusts and estates must apply the following modifications:
    (1) Increase the amount of carryback or carryover applied in the taxable year by the amount of
losses and interest, taxes and other expenses not assignable or allowable to Minnesota incurred in
the taxable year.
     (2) Decrease the amount of carryback or carryover applied in the taxable year by the amount
of income not assignable to Minnesota earned in the taxable year. For estates and trusts, the net
operating loss carryback or carryover to the next consecutive taxable year shall be the net operating
loss carryback or carryover as calculated in clause (b) less the amount applied in the earlier taxable
year(s). No additional net operating loss carryback or carryover shall be allowed to estates and trusts
if the entire amount has been used to offset Minnesota income in a year earlier than was possible
on the federal return. However, if a net operating loss carryback or carryover was allowed to offset
federal income in a year earlier than was possible on the Minnesota return, an estate or trust shall
still be allowed to offset Minnesota income but only if the loss was assignable to Minnesota in the
year the loss occurred.
   (c) This paragraph does not apply to eligible small businesses that make a valid election to carry
back their losses for federal purposes under section 172(b)(1)(H) of the Internal Revenue Code as
amended through March 31, 2009.
    (1) A net operating loss of an individual, estate, or trust that is allowed under this subdivision
and for which the taxpayer elects to carry back for more than two years under section 172(b)(1)(H)
of the Internal Revenue Code is a net operating loss carryback to each of the two taxable years
preceding the loss, and unused portions may be carried forward for 20 taxable years after the loss.
    (2) The entire amount of the net operating loss for any taxable year must be carried to the earliest
of the taxable years to which the loss may be carried. The portion of the loss which may be carried
to each of the other taxable years is the excess, if any, of the amount of the loss over the greater
of the taxable net income or alternative minimum taxable income for each of the taxable years to
which the loss may be carried.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively for losses generated in taxable years
beginning after December 31, 2007.

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.1231, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Homestead property. "Homestead property" means a homestead dwelling that is
classified as class 1a, 1b, ­
                            1­c­
                               , or 2a property or a manufactured home or sectional home used as a
homestead and taxed pursuant to section 273.125, subdivision 8, paragraph (b), (c), or (d).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.124, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. General rule. (a) Residential real estate that is occupied and used for the purposes
of a homestead by its owner, who must be a Minnesota resident, is a residential homestead.
   Agricultural land, as defined in section 273.13, subdivision 23, that is occupied and used as a
homestead by its owner, who must be a Minnesota resident, is an agricultural homestead.
   Dates for establishment of a homestead and homestead treatment provided to particular types of
property are as provided in this section.
   Property held by a trustee under a trust is eligible for homestead classification if the requirements
under this chapter are satisfied.
    The assessor shall require proof, as provided in subdivision 13, of the facts upon which
classification as a homestead may be determined. Notwithstanding any other law, the assessor may
at any time require a homestead application to be filed in order to verify that any property classified
as a homestead continues to be eligible for homestead status. Notwithstanding any other law to
the contrary, the Department of Revenue may, upon request from an assessor, verify whether an
individual who is requesting or receiving homestead classification has filed a Minnesota income
tax return as a resident for the most recent taxable year for which the information is available.
    When there is a name change or a transfer of homestead property, the assessor may reclassify
the property in the next assessment unless a homestead application is filed to verify that the property
continues to qualify for homestead classification.
    (b) For purposes of this section, homestead property shall include property which is used for
purposes of the homestead but is separated from the homestead by a road, street, lot, waterway,
or other similar intervening property. The term "used for purposes of the homestead" shall include
but not be limited to uses for gardens, garages, or other outbuildings commonly associated with
a homestead, but shall not include vacant land held primarily for future development. In order
to receive homestead treatment for the noncontiguous property, the owner must use the property
for the purposes of the homestead, and must apply to the assessor, both by the deadlines given in
subdivision 9. After initial qualification for the homestead treatment, additional applications for
subsequent years are not required.
    (c) Residential real estate that is occupied and used for purposes of a homestead by a relative of
the owner is a homestead but only to the extent of the homestead treatment that would be provided if
the related owner occupied the property. For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (g), "relative"
means a parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, uncle, aunt,

as seasonal residential recreational property at any time during which it has been owned by the
current owner or spouse of the current owner will not be reclassified as a homestead unless it is
occupied as a homestead by the owner; this prohibition also applies to property that, in the absence
of this paragraph, would have been classified as seasonal residential recreational property at the time
when the residence was constructed. Neither the related occupant nor the owner of the property may
claim a property tax refund under chapter 290A for a homestead occupied by a relative. In the case
of a residence located on agricultural land, only the house, garage, and immediately surrounding one
acre of land shall be classified as a homestead under this paragraph, except as provided in paragraph
(d).
    (d) Agricultural property that is occupied and used for purposes of a homestead by a relative of
the owner, is a homestead, only to the extent of the homestead treatment that would be provided if
the related owner occupied the property, and only if all of the following criteria are met:
    (1) the relative who is occupying the agricultural property is a ­                     so

    (2) the owner of the agricultural property must be a Minnesota resident;
    (3) the owner of the agricultural property must not receive homestead treatment on any other
agricultural property in Minnesota; and
   (4) the owner of the agricultural property is limited to only one agricultural homestead per family
under this paragraph.
   Neither the related occupant nor the owner of the property may claim a property tax refund
under chapter 290A for a homestead occupied by a relative qualifying under this paragraph. For
purposes of this paragraph, "agricultural property" means the house, garage, other farm buildings
and structures, and agricultural land.
   Application must be made to the assessor by the owner of the agricultural property to receive
homestead benefits under this paragraph. The assessor may require the necessary proof that the
requirements under this paragraph have been met.
    (e) In the case of property owned by a property owner who is married, the assessor must not deny
homestead treatment in whole or in part if only one of the spouses occupies the property and the other
spouse is absent due to: (1) marriage dissolution proceedings, (2) legal separation, (3) employment
or self-employment in another location, or (4) other personal circumstances causing the spouses
to live separately, not including an intent to obtain two homestead classifications for property tax
purposes. To qualify under clause (3), the spouse's place of employment or self-employment must
be at least 50 miles distant from the other spouse's place of employment, and the homesteads must
be at least 50 miles distant from each other. H           ­o­m­­e­

a nursing home, boarding care facility, or an elderly assisted living facility property as defined in
section 273.13, subdivision 25a, and the property is not otherwise occupied; or
    (2) in the case of a property owner who is married, the owner or the owner's spouse or both
are absent due to residence in a nursing home, boarding care facility, or an elderly assisted living
facility property as defined in section 273.13, subdivision 25a, and the property is not occupied or
is occupied only by the owner's spouse.
     (g) If an individual is purchasing property with the intent of claiming it as a homestead and
is required by the terms of the financing agreement to have a relative shown on the deed as a
co-owner, the assessor shall allow a full homestead classification. This provision only applies to
first-time purchasers, whether married or single, or to a person who had previously been married
and is purchasing as a single individual for the first time. The application for homestead benefits
must be on a form prescribed by the commissioner and must contain the data necessary for the
assessor to determine if full homestead benefits are warranted.
    (h) If residential or agricultural real estate is occupied and used for purposes of a homestead by
a child of a deceased owner and the property is subject to jurisdiction of probate court, the child
shall receive relative homestead classification under paragraph (c) or (d) to the same extent they
would be entitled to it if the owner was still living, until the probate is completed. For purposes of
this paragraph, "child" includes a relationship by blood or by marriage.
    (i) If a single-family home, duplex, or triplex classified as either residential homestead or
agricultural homestead is also used to provide licensed child care, the portion of the property used
for licensed child care must be classified as a part of the homestead property.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2012 and thereafter.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.124, subdivision 14, is amended to read:
    Subd. 14. Agricultural homesteads; special provisions. (a) Real estate of less than ten acres
that is the homestead of its owner must be classified as class 2a under section 273.13, subdivision
23, paragraph (a), if:
   (1) the parcel on which the house is located is contiguous on at least two sides to (i) agricultural
land, (ii) land owned or administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, or (iii) land
administered by the Department of Natural Resources on which in lieu taxes are paid under sections
477A.11 to 477A.14;
   (2) its owner also owns a noncontiguous parcel of agricultural land that is at least 20 acres;
    (3) the noncontiguous land is located not farther than four townships or cities, or a combination
of townships or cities from the homestead; and
   (4) the agricultural use value of the noncontiguous land and farm buildings is equal to at least
50 percent of the market value of the house, garage, and one acre of land.
    Homesteads initially classified as class 2a under the provisions of this paragraph shall remain
classified as class 2a, irrespective of subsequent changes in the use of adjoining properties, as long
as the homestead remains under the same ownership, the owner owns a noncontiguous parcel
of agricultural land that is at least 20 acres, and the agricultural use value qualifies under clause

(4). Homestead classification under this paragraph is limited to property that qualified under this
paragraph for the 1998 assessment.

and correctional 40's;

   (f) Agricultural land and buildings that were class 2a homestead property under section
273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (a), for the 1998 assessment shall remain classified agricultural

homestead. The commissioner of revenue shall prepare a standard reapplication form for use by
the assessors.

   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 282.01, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Conveyance to public entities. (a) Upon written request from a state agency or a
governmental subdivision of the state, a parcel of unsold tax-forfeited land must be withheld from
sale or lease to others for a maximum of six months. The request must be submitted to the county
auditor. Upon receipt, the county auditor must withhold the parcel from sale or lease to any other
party for six months, and must confirm the starting date of the six-month withholding period to the
requesting agency or subdivision. If the request is from a governmental subdivision of the state, the
governmental subdivision must pay the maintenance costs incurred by the county during the period
52ND DAY]                           TUESDAY, MAY 10, 2011                                       1889

the parcel is withheld. The county board may approve a sale or conveyance to the requesting party
during the withholding period. A conveyance of the property to the requesting party terminates the
withholding period.
    A governmental subdivision of the state must not make, and a county auditor must not act upon,
a second request to withhold a parcel from sale or lease within 18 months of a previous request for
that parcel. A county may reject a request made under this paragraph if the request is made more than
30 days after the county has given notice to the requesting state agency or governmental subdivision
of the state that the county intends to sell or otherwise dispose of the property.
    (b) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be sold by the county board, for their market value
as determined by the county board, to an organized or incorporated governmental subdivision of the
state for any public purpose for which the subdivision is authorized to acquire property. When the
term "market value" is used in this section, it means an estimate of the full and actual market value
of the parcel as determined by the county board, but in making this determination, the board and the
persons employed by or under contract with the board in order to perform, conduct, or assist in the
determination, are exempt from the licensure requirements of chapter 82B.
    (c) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be released from the trust in favor of the taxing
districts on application to the county board by a state agency for an authorized use at not less than
their market value as determined by the county board.
    (d) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be sold by the county board to an organized or
incorporated governmental subdivision of the state or state agency for less than their market value
if:
   (1) the county board determines that a sale at a reduced price is in the public interest because a
reduced price is necessary to provide an incentive to correct the blighted conditions that make the
lands undesirable in the open market, or the reduced price will lead to the development of affordable
housing; and
     (2) the governmental subdivision or state agency has documented its specific plans for correcting
the blighted conditions or developing affordable housing, and the specific law or laws that empower
it to acquire real property in furtherance of the plans.
    If the sale under this paragraph is to a governmental subdivision of the state, the commissioner
of revenue must convey the property on behalf of the state by quit claim deed. If the sale under this
paragraph is to a state agency, the commissioner must issue a conveyance document that releases
the property from the trust in favor of the taxing districts.
    (e) Nonconservation tax-forfeited land held in trust in favor of the taxing districts may be
conveyed by the commissioner of revenue in the name of the state to a governmental subdivision
for an authorized public use, if an application is submitted to the commissioner which includes a
statement of facts as to the use to be made of the tract and the favorable recommendation of the
county board. For the purposes of this paragraph, "authorized public use" means a use that allows
an indefinite segment of the public to physically use and enjoy the property in numbers appropriate
to its size and use, or is for a public service facility. Authorized public uses as defined in this
paragraph are limited to:
   (1) a road, or right-of-way for a road;

improvements such as campgrounds, playgrounds, athletic fields, trails, or shelters;
    (3) trails for walking, bicycling, snowmobiling, or other recreational purposes, along with a
reasonable amount of surrounding land maintained in its natural state;
    (4) transit facilities for buses, light rail transit, commuter rail or passenger rail, including transit
ways, park-and-ride lots, transit stations, maintenance and garage facilities, and other facilities
related to a public transit system;
    (5) public beaches or boat launches;
    (6) public parking;
    (7) civic recreation or conference facilities; and
    (8) public service facilities such as fire halls, police stations, lift stations, water towers, sanitation
facilities, water treatment facilities, and administrative offices.
No monetary compensation or consideration is required for the conveyance, except as provided in
subdivision 1g, but the conveyance is subject to the conditions provided in law, including, but not
limited to, the reversion provisions of subdivisions 1c and 1d.
    (f) The commissioner of revenue shall convey a parcel of nonconservation tax-forfeited land
to a local governmental subdivision of the state by quit claim deed on behalf of the state upon the
favorable recommendation of the county board if the governmental subdivision has certified to the
board that prior to forfeiture the subdivision was entitled to the parcel under a written development
agreement or instrument, but the conveyance failed to occur prior to forfeiture. No compensation or
consideration is required for, and no conditions attach to, the conveyance.
    (g) The commissioner of revenue shall convey a parcel of nonconservation tax-forfeited
land to the association of a common interest community by quit claim deed upon the favorable
recommendation of the county board if the association certifies to the board that prior to forfeiture
the association was entitled to the parcel under a written agreement, but the conveyance failed
to occur prior to forfeiture. No compensation or consideration is required for, and no conditions
attach to, the conveyance.
    (h) Conservation tax-forfeited land may be sold to a governmental subdivision of the state
for less than its market value for either: (1) creation or preservation of wetlands; (2) drainage or
storage of storm water under a storm water management plan; or (3) preservation, or restoration
and preservation, of the land in its natural state. The deed must contain a restrictive covenant
limiting the use of the land to one of these purposes for 30 years or until the property is reconveyed
back to the state in trust. At any time, the governmental subdivision may reconvey the property to
the state in trust for the taxing districts. The deed of reconveyance is subject to approval by the
commissioner of revenue. No part of a purchase price determined under this paragraph shall be
refunded upon a reconveyance, but the amount paid for a conveyance under this paragraph may
be taken into account by the county board when setting the terms of a future sale of the same
property to the same governmental subdivision under paragraph (b) or (d). If the lands are unplatted
and located outside of an incorporated municipality and the commissioner of natural resources
determines there is a mineral use potential, the sale is subject to the approval of the commissioner
of natural resources.

governmental subdivision has failed to put the land to that use, or abandons that use, the governing
body of the subdivision must: (1) with the approval of the county board, purchase the property
for an authorized public purpose at the present market value as determined by the county board,
or (2) authorize the proper officers to convey the land, or the part of the land not required for an
authorized public use, to the state of Minnesota in trust for the taxing districts. If the governing body
purchases the property under clause (1), the commissioner of revenue shall, upon proper application
submitted by the county auditor, convey the property on behalf of the state by quit claim deed to the
subdivision free of a use restriction and the possibility of reversion or defeasement. If the governing
body decides to reconvey the property to the state under this clause, the officers shall execute a
deed of conveyance immediately. The conveyance is subject to the approval of the commissioner
and its form must be approved by the attorney general. For ­h   t­­

    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 298.28, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. City or town where quarried or produced. (a) 4.5 cents per gross ton of merchantable
iron ore concentrate, hereinafter referred to as "taxable ton," plus the amount provided in paragraph
(c), must be allocated to the city or town in the county in which the lands from which taconite
was mined or quarried were located or within which the concentrate was produced. If the mining,
quarrying, and concentration, or different steps in either thereof are carried on in more than one
taxing district, the commissioner shall apportion equitably the proceeds of the part of the tax going
to cities and towns among such subdivisions upon the basis of attributing 50 percent of the proceeds
of the tax to the operation of mining or quarrying the taconite, and the remainder to the concentrating
plant and to the processes of concentration, and with respect to each thereof giving due consideration
to the relative extent of such operations performed in each such taxing district. The commissioner's
order making such apportionment shall be subject to review by the Tax Court at the instance of any
of the interested taxing districts, in the same manner as other orders of the commissioner.
    (b) Four cents per taxable ton shall be allocated to cities and organized townships affected by
mining because their boundaries are within three miles of a taconite mine pit that has been actively
mined in at least one of the prior three years. If a city or town is located near more than one mine
meeting these criteria, the city or town is eligible to receive aid calculated from only the mine
producing the largest taxable tonnage. When more than one municipality qualifies for aid based on
one company's production, the aid must be apportioned among the municipalities in proportion to
their populations. Of the amounts distributed under this paragraph to each municipality, one-half
must be used for infrastructure improvement projects, and one-half must be used for projects in
which two or more municipalities cooperate. Each municipality that receives a distribution under
this paragraph must report annually to the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board and the
commissioner of Iron Range resources and rehabilitation on the projects involving cooperation with
other municipalities.

    For purposes of this chapter, lottery prizes, as set forth in section 349A.08, subdivision 8, and
amounts granted to persons by the legislature on the recommendation of the joint senate-house of

shall remit the entire refund to the claimant agency, which shall, upon the request of the spouse
who does not owe the debt, determine the amount of the refund belonging to that spouse and refund
the amount to that spouse. For court fines, fees, and surcharges and court-ordered restitution under

     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 272.02, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 95. St. Louis County fairgrounds. Land and buildings used exclusively for county or
community fairgrounds as provided in section 383C.164.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2012 and thereafter.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.13, subdivision 23, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23. Class 2. (a) An agricultural homestead consists of class 2a agricultural land that is
homesteaded, along with any class 2b rural vacant land that is contiguous to the class 2a land under
the same ownership. The market value of the house and garage and immediately surrounding one
acre of land has the same class rates as class 1a or 1b property under subdivision 22. The value of the
remaining land including improvements up to the first tier valuation limit of agricultural homestead
property has a net class rate of 0.5 percent of market value. The remaining property over the first
tier has a class rate of one percent of market value. For purposes of this subdivision, the "first tier
valuation limit of agricultural homestead property" and "first tier" means the limit certified under
section 273.11, subdivision 23.
    (b) Class 2a agricultural land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
agricultural land and buildings. Class 2a property has a net class rate of one percent of market
value, unless it is part of an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a). Class 2a property must
also include any property that would otherwise be classified as 2b, but is interspersed with class
2a property, including but not limited to sloughs, wooded wind shelters, acreage abutting ditches,
ravines, rock piles, land subject to a setback requirement, and other similar land that is impractical
for the assessor to value separately from the rest of the property or that is unlikely to be able to
be sold separately from the rest of the property.
    An assessor may classify the part of a parcel described in this subdivision that is used for
agricultural purposes as class 2a and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use.
52ND DAY]                           TUESDAY, MAY 10, 2011                                       1903

    (c) Class 2b rural vacant land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
unplatted real estate, rural in character and not used for agricultural purposes, including land
used for growing trees for timber, lumber, and wood and wood products, that is not improved
with a structure. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
Any parcel of 20 acres or more improved with a structure that is not a minor, ancillary nonresidential
structure must be split-classified, and ten acres must be assigned to the split parcel containing the
structure. Class 2b property has a net class rate of one percent of market value unless it is part of
an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a), or qualifies as class 2c under paragraph (d).
    (d) Class 2c managed forest land consists of no less than 20 and no more than 1,920 acres
statewide per taxpayer that is being managed under a forest management plan that meets the
requirements of chapter 290C, but is not enrolled in the sustainable forest resource management
incentive program. It has a class rate of .65 percent, provided that the owner of the property must
apply to the assessor in order for the property to initially qualify for the reduced rate and provide
the information required by the assessor to verify that the property qualifies for the reduced rate.
If the assessor receives the application and information before May 1 in an assessment year, the
property qualifies beginning with that assessment year. If the assessor receives the application
and information after April 30 in an assessment year, the property may not qualify until the next
assessment year. The commissioner of natural resources must concur that the land is qualified. The
commissioner of natural resources shall annually provide county assessors verification information
on a timely basis. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
    (e) Agricultural land as used in this section means contiguous acreage of ten acres or more, used
during the preceding year for agricultural purposes. "Agricultural purposes" as used in this section
means the raising, cultivation, drying, or storage of agricultural products for sale, or the storage
of machinery or equipment used in support of agricultural production by the same farm entity.
For a property to be classified as agricultural based only on the drying or storage of agricultural
products, the products being dried or stored must have been produced by the same farm entity as the
entity operating the drying or storage facility. "Agricultural purposes" also includes enrollment in
the Reinvest in Minnesota program under sections 103F.501 to 103F.535 or the federal Conservation
Reserve Program as contained in Public Law 99-198 or a similar state or federal conservation
program if the property was classified as agricultural (i) under this subdivision for the assessment
year 2002 or (ii) in the year prior to its enrollment. Agricultural classification shall not be based
upon the market value of any residential structures on the parcel or contiguous parcels under the
same ownership.
    (f) Real estate of less than ten acres, which is exclusively or intensively used for raising or
cultivating agricultural products, shall be considered as agricultural land. To qualify under this
paragraph, property that includes a residential structure must be used intensively for one of the
following purposes:
    (i) for drying or storage of grain or storage of machinery or equipment used to support
agricultural activities on other parcels of property operated by the same farming entity;
    (ii) as a nursery, provided that only those acres used to produce nursery stock are considered
agricultural land;

   (iii) for livestock or poultry confinement, provided that land that is used only for pasturing and
grazing does not qualify; or
    (iv) for market farming; for purposes of this paragraph, "market farming" means the cultivation
of one or more fruits or vegetables or production of animal or other agricultural products for sale to
local markets by the farmer or an organization with which the farmer is affiliated.
   (g) Land shall be classified as agricultural even if all or a portion of the agricultural use of that
property is the leasing to, or use by another person for agricultural purposes.
   Classification under this subdivision is not determinative for qualifying under section 273.111.
    (h) The property classification under this section supersedes, for property tax purposes only, any
locally administered agricultural policies or land use restrictions that define minimum or maximum
farm acreage.
   (i) The term "agricultural products" as used in this subdivision includes production for sale of:
   (1) livestock, dairy animals, dairy products, poultry and poultry products, fur-bearing animals,
horticultural and nursery stock, fruit of all kinds, vegetables, forage, grains, bees, and apiary
products by the owner;
   (2) fish bred for sale and consumption if the fish breeding occurs on land zoned for agricultural
use;
    (3) the commercial boarding of horses, which may include related horse training and riding
instruction, if the boarding is done on property that is also used for raising pasture to graze horses
or raising or cultivating other agricultural products as defined in clause (1);
    (4) property which is owned and operated by nonprofit organizations used for equestrian
activities, excluding racing;
    (5) game birds and waterfowl bred and raised (i) on a game farm licensed under section 97A.105,
provided that the annual licensing report, which must be submitted annually by March 30 to the
assessor, to the Department of Natural Resources indicates that least 500 birds were raised or used
for breeding stock on the property during the year; or (ii) for use on a shooting preserve licensed
under section 97A.115;
   (6) insects primarily bred to be used as food for animals;
   (7) trees, grown for sale as a crop, including short rotation woody crops, and not sold for timber,
lumber, wood, or wood products; and
   (8) maple syrup taken from trees grown by a person licensed by the Minnesota Department of
Agriculture under chapter 28A as a food processor.
    (j) If a parcel used for agricultural purposes is also used for commercial or industrial purposes,
including but not limited to:
   (1) wholesale and retail sales;
   (2) processing of raw agricultural products or other goods;

   (3) warehousing or storage of processed goods; and
   (4) office facilities for the support of the activities enumerated in clauses (1), (2), and (3),
the assessor shall classify the part of the parcel used for agricultural purposes as class 1b, 2a, or 2b,
whichever is appropriate, and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use. The grading, sorting,
and packaging of raw agricultural products for first sale is considered an agricultural purpose. A
greenhouse or other building where horticultural or nursery products are grown that is also used for
the conduct of retail sales must be classified as agricultural if it is primarily used for the growing
of horticultural or nursery products from seed, cuttings, or roots and occasionally as a showroom
for the retail sale of those products. Use of a greenhouse or building only for the display of already
grown horticultural or nursery products does not qualify as an agricultural purpose.
    (k) The assessor shall determine and list separately on the records the market value of the
homestead dwelling and the one acre of land on which that dwelling is located. If any farm
buildings or structures are located on this homesteaded acre of land, their market value shall not be
included in this separate determination.
    (l) Class 2d airport landing area consists of a landing area or public access area of a privately
owned public use airport. It has a class rate of one percent of market value. To qualify for
classification under this paragraph, a privately owned public use airport must be licensed as a
public airport under section 360.018. For purposes of this paragraph, "landing area" means that part
of a privately owned public use airport properly cleared, regularly maintained, and made available
to the public for use by aircraft and includes runways, taxiways, aprons, and sites upon which are
situated landing or navigational aids. A landing area also includes land underlying both the primary
surface and the approach surfaces that comply with all of the following:
    (i) the land is properly cleared and regularly maintained for the primary purposes of the landing,
taking off, and taxiing of aircraft; but that portion of the land that contains facilities for servicing,
repair, or maintenance of aircraft is not included as a landing area;
   (ii) the land is part of the airport property; and
   (iii) the land is not used for commercial or residential purposes.
The land contained in a landing area under this paragraph must be described and certified by the
commissioner of transportation. The certification is effective until it is modified, or until the airport
or landing area no longer meets the requirements of this paragraph. For purposes of this paragraph,
"public access area" means property used as an aircraft parking ramp, apron, or storage hangar, or
an arrival and departure building in connection with the airport.
    (m) Class 2e consists of land with a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively being
mined and is not otherwise classified as class 2a or 2b, provided that the land is not located in a county
that has elected to opt-out of the aggregate preservation program as provided in section 273.1115,
subdivision 6. It has a class rate of one percent of market value. To qualify for classification under
this paragraph, the property must be at least ten contiguous acres in size and the owner of the property
must record with the county recorder of the county in which the property is located an affidavit
containing:
   (1) a legal description of the property;
1906                                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                          [52ND DAY

   (2) a disclosure that the property contains a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively
being mined but is present on the entire parcel enrolled;
   (3) documentation that the conditional use under the county or local zoning ordinance of this
property is for mining; and
    (4) documentation that a permit has been issued by the local unit of government or the mining
activity is allowed under local ordinance. The disclosure must include a statement from a registered
professional geologist, engineer, or soil scientist delineating the deposit and certifying that it is a
commercial aggregate deposit.
   For purposes of this section and section 273.1115, "commercial aggregate deposit" means a
deposit that will yield crushed stone or sand and gravel that is suitable for use as a construction
aggregate; and "actively mined" means the removal of top soil and overburden in preparation for
excavation or excavation of a commercial deposit.
    (n) When any portion of the property under this subdivision or subdivision 22 begins to be
actively mined, the owner must file a supplemental affidavit within 60 days from the day any
aggregate is removed stating the number of acres of the property that is actively being mined.
The acres actively being mined must be (1) valued and classified under subdivision 24 in the next
subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource preservation property
tax program under section 273.1115, if the land was enrolled in that program. Copies of the
original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed with the county assessor, the local
zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Land and Minerals.
A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent portion of the property is actively
mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres, even if the actual mining activity
constitutes less than five acres.
   (o) The definitions prescribed by the commissioner under paragraphs (c) and (d) are not rules
and are exempt from the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14, and the provisions in section 14.386
concerning exempt rules do not apply.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2012 and thereafter.

52ND DAY]                            TUESDAY, MAY 10, 2011                                          1907

    (4) identification of all lease agreements not disclosed on a rent roll in the response to clause
(3), listing the tenant name, lease start and end dates, base rent, and square footage leased;
    (5) net rentable square footage of the building or buildings; and
    (6) anticipated income and expenses in the form of a proposed budget for the year subsequent
to the year of the assessment date.
    (b) The information required to be provided to the county assessor under paragraph (a) does
not include leases. Failure to provide the information required in ­h t­­s
                                                                        i­ paragraph (a) shall result in
the dismissal of the petition, unless (1) the failure to provide it was due to the unavailability of the
e­
­v­d e­
   i­­n­c­
         e information at the time that the information was due, or (2) the petitioner was not aware
of or informed of the requirement to provide the information.
If the petitioner proves that the requirements under clause (2) are met, the petitioner has an additional
30 days to provide the information from the time the petitioner became aware of or was informed
of the requirement to provide the information, otherwise the petition shall be dismissed.
    (c) If, after the August 1 deadline set in paragraph (a), a county assessor determines that the actual
leases in effect on the assessment date are necessary to properly evaluate the income-producing
property, then a county assessor may require that the petitioner submit the leases. The petitioner
must provide the requested information to the county assessor within 60 days of a county assessor's
request. The tax court shall hear and decide any issues relating to subsequent information requests
by a county assessor. Failure to provide the information required in this paragraph shall be addressed

the person to whom the responsibility is
transferred of the property restrictions under
subdivision 13; and (3) provide written notice

    (b) The commissioner, in cooperation with the commissioner of human services, shall consider
the following criteria when determining that an area of the state is a hardship area with regard to
access to nursing facility services:
   (1) a low number of beds per thousand in a specified area using as a standard the beds per
thousand people age 65 and older, in five year age groups, using data from the most recent census
and population projections, weighted by each groups' most recent nursing home utilization, of the
county at the 20th percentile, as determined by the commissioner of human services;
    (2) a high level of out-migration for nursing facility services associated with a described
area from the county or counties of residence to other Minnesota counties, as determined by the
commissioner of human services, using as a standard an amount greater than the out-migration of
the county ranked at the 50th percentile;
    (3) an adequate level of availability of noninstitutional long-term care services measured as
public spending for home and community-based long-term care services per individual age 65 and
older, in five year age groups, using data from the most recent census and population projections,
weighted by each groups' most recent nursing home utilization, as determined by the commissioner
of human services using as a standard an amount greater than the 50th percentile of counties;
   (4) there must be a declaration of hardship resulting from insufficient access to nursing home
beds by local county agencies and area agencies on aging; and
     (5) other factors that may demonstrate the need to add new nursing facility beds.
    (c) On August 15 of odd-numbered years, the commissioner, in cooperation with the
commissioner of human services, may publish in the State Register a request for information in
which interested parties, using the data provided under section 144A.351, along with any other
relevant data, demonstrate that a specified area is a hardship area with regard to access to nursing
facility services. For a response to be considered, the commissioner must receive it by November
15. The commissioner shall make responses to the request for information available to the public
and shall allow 30 days for comment. The commissioner shall review responses and comments and
determine if any areas of the state are to be declared hardship areas.
   (d) For each designated hardship area determined in paragraph (c), the commissioner shall
publish a request for proposals in accordance with section 144A.073 and Minnesota Rules, parts
4655.1070 to 4655.1098. The request for proposals must be published in the State Register by
March 15 following receipt of responses to the request for information. The request for proposals
must specify the number of new beds which may be added in the designated hardship area, which
must not exceed the number which, if added to the existing number of beds in the area, including
beds in layaway status, would have prevented it from being determined to be a hardship area under
paragraph (b), clause (1). Beginning July 1, 2011, the number of new beds approved must not
exceed 200 beds statewide per biennium. After June 30, 2019, the number of new beds that may
be approved in a biennium must not exceed 300 statewide. For a proposal to be considered, the
commissioner must receive it within six months of the publication of the request for proposals. The
commissioner shall review responses to the request for proposals and shall approve or disapprove

each proposal by the following July 15, in accordance with section 144A.073 and Minnesota
Rules, parts 4655.1070 to 4655.1098. The commissioner shall base approvals or disapprovals on
a comparison and ranking of proposals using only the criteria in subdivision 4a. Approval of a
proposal expires after 18 months unless the facility has added the new beds using existing space,
subject to approval by the commissioner, or has commenced construction as defined in section
144A.071, subdivision 1a, paragraph (d). Operating payment rates shall be determined according to
Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0057, using the limits under section 256B.441. External fixed payment
rates must be determined according to section 256B.441, subdivision 53. Property payment rates
for facilities with beds added under this subdivision must be determined in the same manner as rate
determinations resulting from projects approved and completed under section 144A.073.

     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 144A.071, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4d. Consolidation of nursing facilities. (a) The commissioner of health, in consultation
with the commissioner of human services, may approve a request for consolidation of nursing
facilities which includes the closure of one or more facilities and the upgrading of the physical
plant of the remaining nursing facility or facilities, the costs of which exceed the threshold project
limit under subdivision 2, clause (a). The commissioners shall consider the criteria in this section,
section 144A.073, and section 256B.437, in approving or rejecting a consolidation proposal. In the
event the commissioners approve the request, the commissioner of human services shall calculate
a property rate adjustment according to clauses (1) to (3):
   (1) the closure of beds shall not be eligible for a planned closure rate adjustment under section
256B.437, subdivision 6;
    (2) the construction project permitted in this clause shall not be eligible for a threshold project
rate adjustment under section 256B.434, subdivision 4f, or a moratorium exception adjustment under
section 144A.073; and
    (3) the property payment rate for a remaining facility or facilities shall be increased by an
amount equal to 65 percent of the projected net cost savings to the state calculated in paragraph (b),
divided by the state's medical assistance percentage of medical assistance dollars, and then divided

by estimated medical assistance resident days, as determined in paragraph (c), of the remaining
nursing facility or facilities in the request in this paragraph.
    (b) For purposes of calculating the net cost savings to the state, the commissioner shall consider
clauses (1) to (7):
    (1) the annual savings from estimated medical assistance payments from the net number of beds
closed taking into consideration only beds that are in active service on the date of the request and
that have been in active service for at least three years;
    (2) the estimated annual cost of increased case load of individuals receiving services under the
elderly waiver;
    (3) the estimated annual cost of elderly waiver recipients receiving support under group
residential housing;
    (4) the estimated annual cost of increased case load of individuals receiving services under the
alternative care program;
    (5) the annual loss of license surcharge payments on closed beds;
   (6) the savings from not paying planned closure rate adjustments that the facilities would
otherwise be eligible for under section 256B.437; and
   (7) the savings from not paying property payment rate adjustments from submission of
renovation costs that would otherwise be eligible as threshold projects under section 256B.434,
subdivision 4f.
    (c) For purposes of the calculation in paragraph (a), clause (3), the estimated medical assistance
resident days of the remaining facility or facilities shall be computed assuming 95 percent occupancy
multiplied by the historical percentage of medical assistance resident days of the remaining facility
or facilities, as reported on the facility's or facilities' most recent nursing facility statistical and cost
report filed before the plan of closure is submitted, multiplied by 365.
    (d) For purposes of net cost of savings to the state in paragraph (b), the average occupancy
percentages will be those reported on the facility's or facilities' most recent nursing facility statistical
and cost report filed before the plan of closure is submitted, and the average payment rates shall be
calculated based on the approved payment rates in effect at the time the consolidation request is
submitted.
   (e) To qualify for the property payment rate adjustment under this provision, the closing facilities
shall:
    (1) submit an application for closure according to section 256B.437, subdivision 3; and
    (2) follow the resident relocation provisions of section 144A.161.
    (f) The county or counties in which a facility or facilities are closed under this subdivision shall
not be eligible for designation as a hardship area under section 144A.071, subdivision 3, for five
years from the date of the approval of the proposed consolidation. The applicant shall notify the
county of this limitation and the county shall acknowledge this in a letter of support.

recommending proposals:
   (1) the extent to which the proposed nursing home project is integrated with other health and
long-term care services for older adults;
   (2) the extent to which the project provides for the complete replacement of an outdated physical
plant;
   (3) the extent to which the project results in a reduction of nursing facility beds in an area that
has a relatively high number of beds per thousand occupied by persons age 85 and over;
   (4) the extent to which the project produces improvements in health; safety, including life safety
code corrections; quality of life; and privacy of residents;
   (5) the extent to which, under the current facility ownership and management, the provider has
shown the ability to provide good quality of care based on health-related findings on certification
surveys, quality indicator scores, and quality-of-life scores, including those from the Minnesota
nursing home report card;
    (6) the extent to which the project integrates the latest technology and design features in a way
that improves the resident experience and improves the working environment for employees;
    (7) the extent to which the sustainability of the nursing facility can be demonstrated based on
the need for services in the area and the proposed financing of the project; and
    (8) the extent to which the project provides or maintains access to nursing facility services needed
in the community.
    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.431, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

section 144A.073, subdivision 11, shall be used, effective November 1, 2010, to fund an approved
moratorium exception project for a nursing facility in Bloomington licensed for 137 beds as of
November 1, 2010, up to a total property rate adjustment of $19.33.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.441, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 60. Method for determining budget-neutral nursing facility rates for relocated
beds. (a) Nursing facility rates for bed relocations must be calculated by comparing the estimated
medical assistance costs prior to and after the proposed bed relocation using the calculations in
this subdivision. All payment rates are based on a 1.0 case mix level, with other case mix rates
determined accordingly. Nursing facility beds on layaway status that are being moved must be
included in the calculation for both the originating and receiving facility and treated as though they
were in active status with the occupancy characteristics of the active beds of the originating facility.
    (b) Medical assistance costs of the beds in the originating nursing facilities must be calculated
as follows:
    (1) multiply each originating facility's total payment rate for a RUGS weight of 1.0 by the
facility's percentage of medical assistance days on its most recent available cost report;
  (2) take the products in clause (1) and multiply by each facility's average case mix score for
medical assistance residents on its most recent available cost report;
   (3) take the products in clause (2) and multiply by the number of beds being relocated, times
365; and
   (4) calculate the sum of the amounts determined in clause (3).
    (c) Medical assistance costs in the receiving facility, prior to the bed relocation, must be
calculated as follows:
   (1) multiply the facility's total payment rate for a RUGS weight of 1.0 by the medical assistance
days on the most recent cost report; and
    (2) multiply the product in clause (1) by the average case mix weight of medical assistance
residents on the most recent cost report.
   (d) The commissioner shall determine the medical assistance costs prior to the bed relocation
which must be the sum of the amounts determined in paragraphs (b) and (c).
    (e) The commissioner shall estimate the medical assistance costs after the bed relocation as
follows:
    (1) estimate the medical assistance days in the receiving facility after the bed relocation. The
commissioner may use the current medical assistance portion, or if data does not exist, may use the
statewide average, or may use the provider's estimate of the medical assistance utilization of the
relocated beds;
    (2) estimate the average case mix weight of medical assistance residents in the receiving facility
after the bed relocation. The commissioner may use current average case mix weight or, if data does
not exist, may use the statewide average, or may use the provider's estimate of the average case mix
weight; and

    (3) multiply the amount determined in clause (1) by the amount determined in clause (2) by the
total payment rate for a RUGS weight of 1.0 that is the highest rate of the facilities from which the
relocated beds either originate or to which they are being relocated so long as that rate is associated
with ten percent or more of the total number of beds to be in the receiving facility after the bed
relocation.
    (f) If the amount determined in paragraph (e) is less than or equal to the amount determined
in paragraph (d), the commissioner shall allow a total payment rate equal to the amount used in
paragraph (e), clause (3).
    (g) If the amount determined in paragraph (e) is greater than the amount determined in paragraph
(d), the commissioner shall allow a rate with a RUGS weight of 1.0 that when used in paragraph (e),
clause (3), results in the amount determined in paragraph (e) being equal to the amount determined
in paragraph (d).
    (h) If the commissioner relies upon provider estimates in paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2), then
annually, for three years after the rates determined in this subdivision take effect, the commissioner
shall determine the accuracy of the alternative factors of medical assistance case load and RUGS
weight used in this subdivision and shall reduce the total payment rate for a RUGS weight of 1.0 if
the factors used result in medical assistance costs exceeding the amount in paragraph (d). If the actual
medical assistance costs exceed the estimates by more than five percent, the commissioner shall also
recover the difference between the estimated costs in paragraph (e) and the actual costs according
to section 256B.0641. The commissioner may require submission of data from the receiving facility
needed to implement this paragraph.
    (i) When beds approved for relocation are put into active service at the destination facility, rates
determined in this subdivision must be adjusted by any adjustment amounts that were implemented
after the date of the letter of approval.
   Sec. 8. REPEALER.
   Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 144A.073, subdivisions 4 and 5, are repealed.
   Sec. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

facility, provided the total costs of remodeling performed in conjunction with the relocation of beds
does not exceed $1,000,000;
    (c) to license or certify beds in a project recommended for approval under section 144A.073;
    (d) to license or certify beds that are moved from an existing state nursing home to a different
state facility, provided there is no net increase in the number of state nursing home beds;
    (e) to certify and license as nursing home beds boarding care beds in a certified boarding care
facility if the beds meet the standards for nursing home licensure, or in a facility that was granted
an exception to the moratorium under section 144A.073, and if the cost of any remodeling of the
facility does not exceed $1,000,000. If boarding care beds are licensed as nursing home beds, the
number of boarding care beds in the facility must not increase beyond the number remaining at
the time of the upgrade in licensure. The provisions contained in section 144A.073 regarding the
upgrading of the facilities do not apply to facilities that satisfy these requirements;
    (f) to license and certify up to 40 beds transferred from an existing facility owned and operated
by the Amherst H. Wilder Foundation in the city of St. Paul to a new unit at the same location as
the existing facility that will serve persons with Alzheimer's disease and other related disorders.
The transfer of beds may occur gradually or in stages, provided the total number of beds transferred
does not exceed 40. At the time of licensure and certification of a bed or beds in the new unit,
the commissioner of health shall delicense and decertify the same number of beds in the existing
facility. As a condition of receiving a license or certification under this clause, the facility must
make a written commitment to the commissioner of human services that it will not seek to receive an

    (g) to license and certify nursing home beds to replace currently licensed and certified boarding
care beds which may be located either in a remodeled or renovated boarding care or nursing home
facility or in a remodeled, renovated, newly constructed, or replacement nursing home facility
within the identifiable complex of health care facilities in which the currently licensed boarding
care beds are presently located, provided that the number of boarding care beds in the facility or
complex are decreased by the number to be licensed as nursing home beds and further provided
that, if the total costs of new construction, replacement, remodeling, or renovation exceed ten
percent of the appraised value of the facility or $200,000, whichever is less, the facility makes
a written commitment to the commissioner of human services that it will not seek to receive an
increase in its property-related payment rate by reason of the new construction, replacement,
remodeling, or renovation. The provisions contained in section 144A.073 regarding the upgrading
of facilities do not apply to facilities that satisfy these requirements;
    (h) to license as a nursing home and certify as a nursing facility a facility that is licensed as
a boarding care facility but not certified under the medical assistance program, but only if the

to the state general fund of $200,000 or more;
    (i) to certify, after September 30, 1992, and prior to July 1, 1993, existing nursing home beds in
a facility that was licensed and in operation prior to January 1, 1992;
     (j) to license and certify new nursing home beds to replace beds in a facility acquired by the
Minneapolis Community Development Agency as part of redevelopment activities in a city of the

Operating and property costs for the new facility must be determined and allowed under section
256B.431 or 256B.434;
    (k) to license and certify up to 20 new nursing home beds in a community-operated hospital
and attached convalescent and nursing care facility with 40 beds on April 21, 1991, that suspended
operation of the hospital in April 1986. The commissioner of human services shall provide the
facility with the same per diem property-related payment rate for each additional licensed and
certified bed as it will receive for its existing 40 beds;
    (l) to license or certify beds in renovation, replacement, or upgrading projects as defined in
section 144A.073, subdivision 1, so long as the cumulative total costs of the facility's remodeling
projects do not exceed $1,000,000;
    (m) to license and certify beds that are moved from one location to another for the purposes of
converting up to five four-bed wards to single or double occupancy rooms in a nursing home that,
as of January 1, 1993, was county-owned and had a licensed capacity of 115 beds;
    (n) to allow a facility that on April 16, 1993, was a 106-bed licensed and certified nursing
facility located in Minneapolis to layaway all of its licensed and certified nursing home beds.
These beds may be relicensed and recertified in a newly constructed teaching nursing home facility
affiliated with a teaching hospital upon approval by the legislature. The proposal must be developed
in consultation with the interagency committee on long-term care planning. The beds on layaway
status shall have the same status as voluntarily delicensed and decertified beds, except that beds

expires July 1, 1998;
    (o) to allow a project which will be completed in conjunction with an approved moratorium
exception project for a nursing home in southern Cass County and which is directly related to
that portion of the facility that must be repaired, renovated, or replaced, to correct an emergency
plumbing problem for which a state correction order has been issued and which must be corrected
by August 31, 1993;
    (p) to allow a facility that on April 16, 1993, was a 368-bed licensed and certified nursing facility
located in Minneapolis to layaway, upon 30 days prior written notice to the commissioner, up to 30 of
the facility's licensed and certified beds by converting three-bed wards to single or double occupancy.
Beds on layaway status shall have the same status as voluntarily delicensed and decertified beds
except that beds on layaway status remain subject to the surcharge in section 256.9657, remain
subject to the license application and renewal fees under section 144A.07 and shall be subject to a
$100 per bed reactivation fee. In addition, at any time within three years of the effective date of the
layaway, the beds on layaway status may be:
    (1) relicensed and recertified upon relocation and reactivation of some or all of the beds to an
existing licensed and certified facility or facilities located in Pine River, Brainerd, or International
Falls; provided that the total project construction costs related to the relocation of beds from layaway
status for any facility receiving relocated beds may not exceed the dollar threshold provided in
subdivision 2 unless the construction project has been approved through the moratorium exception
process under section 144A.073;
    (2) relicensed and recertified, upon reactivation of some or all of the beds within the facility
which placed the beds in layaway status, if the commissioner has determined a need for the
reactivation of the beds on layaway status.
    The property-related payment rate of a facility placing beds on layaway status must be adjusted
by the incremental change in its rental per diem after recalculating the rental per diem as provided
in section 256B.431, subdivision 3a, paragraph (c). The property-related payment rate for a facility
relicensing and recertifying beds from layaway status must be adjusted by the incremental change
in its rental per diem after recalculating its rental per diem using the number of beds after the
relicensing to establish the facility's capacity day divisor, which shall be effective the first day of
the month following the month in which the relicensing and recertification became effective. Any
beds remaining on layaway status more than three years after the date the layaway status became
effective must be removed from layaway status and immediately delicensed and decertified;
    (q) to license and certify beds in a renovation and remodeling project to convert 12 four-bed
wards into 24 two-bed rooms, expand space, and add improvements in a nursing home that, as of
January 1, 1994, met the following conditions: the nursing home was located in Ramsey County;
had a licensed capacity of 154 beds; and had been ranked among the top 15 applicants by the
1993 moratorium exceptions advisory review panel. The total project construction cost estimate for
this project must not exceed the cost estimate submitted in connection with the 1993 moratorium
exception process;
    (r) to license and certify up to 117 beds that are relocated from a licensed and certified 138-bed
nursing facility located in St. Paul to a hospital with 130 licensed hospital beds located in South
St. Paul, provided that the nursing facility and hospital are owned by the same or a related

organization and that prior to the date the relocation is completed the hospital ceases operation of
its inpatient hospital services at that hospital. After relocation, the nursing facility's status under
section 256B.431, subdivision 2j, shall be the same as it was prior to relocation. The nursing
facility's property-related payment rate resulting from the project authorized in this paragraph shall
become effective no earlier than April 1, 1996. For purposes of calculating the incremental change
in the facility's rental per diem resulting from this project, the allowable appraised value of the
nursing facility portion of the existing health care facility physical plant prior to the renovation and
relocation may not exceed $2,490,000;
   (s) to license and certify two beds in a facility to replace beds that were voluntarily delicensed
and decertified on June 28, 1991;
    (t) to allow 16 licensed and certified beds located on July 1, 1994, in a 142-bed nursing home and

of a construction project approved in 1993 under section 144A.073, to be laid away upon 30 days'
prior written notice to the commissioner. Beds on layaway status shall have the same status as
voluntarily delicensed or decertified beds except that they shall remain subject to the surcharge
in section 256.9657. The 16 beds on layaway status may be relicensed as nursing home beds and
recertified at any time within five years of the effective date of the layaway upon relocation of some
or all of the beds to a licensed and certified facility located in Watertown, provided that the total
project construction costs related to the relocation of beds from layaway status for the Watertown
facility may not exceed the dollar threshold provided in subdivision 2 unless the construction project
has been approved through the moratorium exception process under section 144A.073.
    The property-related payment rate of the facility placing beds on layaway status must be adjusted
by the incremental change in its rental per diem after recalculating the rental per diem as provided in
section 256B.431, subdivision 3a, paragraph (c). The property-related payment rate for the facility
relicensing and recertifying beds from layaway status must be adjusted by the incremental change
in its rental per diem after recalculating its rental per diem using the number of beds after the
relicensing to establish the facility's capacity day divisor, which shall be effective the first day of the
month following the month in which the relicensing and recertification became effective. Any beds
remaining on layaway status more than five years after the date the layaway status became effective
must be removed from layaway status and immediately delicensed and decertified;
    (u) to license and certify beds that are moved within an existing area of a facility or to a newly
constructed addition which is built for the purpose of eliminating three- and four-bed rooms and
adding space for dining, lounge areas, bathing rooms, and ancillary service areas in a nursing home

facility in Crow Wing County, provided all the affected beds are under common ownership;
    (w) to license and certify a total replacement project of up to 49 beds located in Norman
County that are relocated from a nursing home destroyed by flood and whose residents were
relocated to other nursing homes. The operating cost payment rates for the new nursing facility
shall be determined based on the interim and settle-up payment provisions of Minnesota Rules,
part 9549.0057, and the reimbursement provisions of section 256B.431, except that subdivision
26, paragraphs (a) and (b), shall not apply until the second rate year after the settle-up cost report

into account any federal or state flood-related loans or grants provided to the facility;
    (x) to license and certify a total replacement project of up to 129 beds located in Polk County that
are relocated from a nursing home destroyed by flood and whose residents were relocated to other
nursing homes. The operating cost payment rates for the new nursing facility shall be determined
based on the interim and settle-up payment provisions of Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0057, and
the reimbursement provisions of section 256B.431, except that subdivision 26, paragraphs (a) and
(b), shall not apply until the second rate year after the settle-up cost report is filed. Property-related
reimbursement rates shall be determined under section 256B.431, taking into account any federal
or state flood-related loans or grants provided to the facility;
    (y) to license and certify beds in a renovation and remodeling project to convert 13 three-bed
wards into 13 two-bed rooms and 13 single-bed rooms, expand space, and add improvements in
a nursing home that, as of January 1, 1994, met the following conditions: the nursing home was
located in Ramsey County, was not owned by a hospital corporation, had a licensed capacity of 64
beds, and had been ranked among the top 15 applicants by the 1993 moratorium exceptions advisory
review panel. The total project construction cost estimate for this project must not exceed the cost
estimate submitted in connection with the 1993 moratorium exception process;
    (z) to license and certify up to 150 nursing home beds to replace an existing 285 bed nursing
facility located in St. Paul. The replacement project shall include both the renovation of existing
buildings and the construction of new facilities at the existing site. The reduction in the licensed
capacity of the existing facility shall occur during the construction project as beds are taken out of
service due to the construction process. Prior to the start of the construction process, the facility shall
provide written information to the commissioner of health describing the process for bed reduction,
plans for the relocation of residents, and the estimated construction schedule. The relocation of
residents shall be in accordance with the provisions of law and rule;
    (aa) to allow the commissioner of human services to license an additional 36 beds to provide
residential services for the physically disabled under Minnesota Rules, parts 9570.2000 to
9570.3400, in a 198-bed nursing home located in Red Wing, provided that the total number of
licensed and certified beds at the facility does not increase;
    (bb) to license and certify a new facility in St. Louis County with 44 beds constructed to replace
an existing facility in St. Louis County with 31 beds, which has resident rooms on two separate floors
and an antiquated elevator that creates safety concerns for residents and prevents nonambulatory
residents from residing on the second floor. The project shall include the elimination of three- and
four-bed rooms;
    (cc) to license and certify four beds in a 16-bed certified boarding care home in Minneapolis
to replace beds that were voluntarily delicensed and decertified on or before March 31, 1992. The
licensure and certification is conditional upon the facility periodically assessing and adjusting its
resident mix and other factors which may contribute to a potential institution for mental disease
declaration. The commissioner of human services shall retain the authority to audit the facility at any
time and shall require the facility to comply with any requirements necessary to prevent an institution
for mental disease declaration, including delicensure and decertification of beds, if necessary;

    (hh) to license and certify up to 120 new nursing facility beds to replace beds in a facility in
Anoka County, which was licensed for 98 beds as of July 1, 2000, provided the new facility is
located within four miles of the existing facility and is in Anoka County. Operating and property
rates shall be determined and allowed under section 256B.431 and Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0010
to 9549.0080, or section 256B.434 or 256B.435. The provisions of section 256B.431, subdivision

    (ii) to transfer up to 98 beds of a 129-licensed bed facility located in Anoka County that, as of
March 25, 2001, is in the active process of closing, to a 122-licensed bed nonprofit nursing facility
located in the city of Columbia Heights or its affiliate. The transfer is effective when the receiving
facility notifies the commissioner in writing of the number of beds accepted. The commissioner
shall place all transferred beds on layaway status held in the name of the receiving facility. The
layaway adjustment provisions of section 256B.431, subdivision 30, do not apply to this layaway.
The receiving facility may only remove the beds from layaway for recertification and relicensure at
the receiving facility's current site, or at a newly constructed facility located in Anoka County. The
receiving facility must receive statutory authorization before removing these beds from layaway
status, or may remove these beds from layaway status if removal from layaway status is part of a
moratorium exception project approved by the commissioner under section 144A.073.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.431, subdivision 26, is amended to read:
    Subd. 26. Changes to nursing facility reimbursement beginning July 1, 1997. The nursing
facility reimbursement changes in paragraphs (a) to (e) shall apply in the sequence specified in
Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0010 to 9549.0080, and this section, beginning July 1, 1997.
    (a) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the commissioner shall limit a nursing
facility's allowable operating per diem for each case mix category for each rate year. The
commissioner shall group nursing facilities into two groups, freestanding and nonfreestanding,

within each geographic group, using their operating cost per diem for the case mix A classification.
A nonfreestanding nursing facility is a nursing facility whose other operating cost per diem is
subject to the hospital attached, short length of stay, or the rule 80 limits. All other nursing facilities
shall be considered freestanding nursing facilities. The commissioner shall then array all nursing
facilities in each grouping by their allowable case mix A operating cost per diem. In calculating
a nursing facility's operating cost per diem for this purpose, the commissioner shall exclude the
raw food cost per diem related to providing special diets that are based on religious beliefs, as
determined in subdivision 2b, paragraph (h). For those nursing facilities in each grouping whose
case mix A operating cost per diem:
    (1) is at or below the median of the array, the commissioner shall limit the nursing facility's
allowable operating cost per diem for each case mix category to the lesser of the prior reporting
year's allowable operating cost per diem as specified in Laws 1996, chapter 451, article 3, section
11, paragraph (h), plus the inflation factor as established in paragraph (d), clause (2), increased by
two percentage points, or the current reporting year's corresponding allowable operating cost per
diem; or
   (2) is above the median of the array, the commissioner shall limit the nursing facility's allowable
operating cost per diem for each case mix category to the lesser of the prior reporting year's allowable
operating cost per diem as specified in Laws 1996, chapter 451, article 3, section 11, paragraph (h),
plus the inflation factor as established in paragraph (d), clause (2), increased by one percentage
point, or the current reporting year's corresponding allowable operating cost per diem.
    For purposes of paragraph (a), if a nursing facility reports on its cost report a reduction in cost
due to a refund or credit for a rate year beginning on or after July 1, 1998, the commissioner shall
increase that facility's spend-up limit for the rate year following the current rate year by the amount
of the cost reduction divided by its resident days for the reporting year preceding the rate year in
which the adjustment is to be made.
    (b) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the commissioner shall limit the allowable
operating cost per diem for high cost nursing facilities. After application of the limits in paragraph
(a) to each nursing facility's operating cost per diem, the commissioner shall group nursing facilities
into two groups, freestanding or nonfreestanding, within each geographic group. A nonfreestanding
nursing facility is a nursing facility whose other operating cost per diem are subject to hospital
attached, short length of stay, or rule 80 limits. All other nursing facilities shall be considered
freestanding nursing facilities. The commissioner shall then array all nursing facilities within each
grouping by their allowable case mix A operating cost per diem. In calculating a nursing facility's
operating cost per diem for this purpose, the commissioner shall exclude the raw food cost per diem
related to providing special diets that are based on religious beliefs, as determined in subdivision
2b, paragraph (h). For those nursing facilities in each grouping whose case mix A operating cost
per diem exceeds 1.0 standard deviation above the median, the commissioner shall reduce their
allowable operating cost per diem by three percent. For those nursing facilities in each grouping
whose case mix A operating cost per diem exceeds 0.5 standard deviation above the median but is
less than or equal to 1.0 standard deviation above the median, the commissioner shall reduce their
allowable operating cost per diem by two percent. However, in no case shall a nursing facility's
operating cost per diem be reduced below its grouping's limit established at 0.5 standard deviations
above the median.
   (c) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the commissioner shall determine a nursing
1936                                                            JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                                             [52ND DAY

facility's efficiency incentive by first computing the allowable difference, which is the lesser of
$4.50 or the amount by which the facility's other operating cost limit exceeds its nonadjusted other
operating cost per diem for that rate year. The commissioner shall compute the efficiency incentive
by:
       (1) subtracting the allowable difference from $4.50 and dividing the result by $4.50;
       (2) multiplying 0.20 by the ratio resulting from clause (1), and then;
       (3) adding 0.50 to the result from clause (2); and
       (4) multiplying the result from clause (3) times the allowable difference.
   The nursing facility's efficiency incentive payment shall be the lesser of $2.25 or the product
obtained in clause (4).
    (d) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the forecasted price index for a nursing
facility's allowable operating cost per diem shall be determined under clauses (1) and (2) using the
change in the Consumer Price Index-All Items (United States city average) (CPI-U) as forecasted
by Data Resources, Inc. The commissioner shall use the indices as forecasted in the fourth quarter
of the calendar year preceding the rate year, subject to subdivision 2l, paragraph (c).
    (1) The CPI-U forecasted index for allowable operating cost per diem shall be based on the
21-month period from the midpoint of the nursing facility's reporting year to the midpoint of the
rate year following the reporting year.
    (2) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the forecasted index for operating cost
limits referred to in subdivision 21, paragraph (b), shall be based on the CPI-U for the 12-month
period between the midpoints of the two reporting years preceding the rate year.
    (e) After applying these provisions for the respective rate years, the commissioner shall index
these allowable operating cost per diem by the inflation factor provided for in paragraph (d), clause
(1), and add the nursing facility's efficiency incentive as computed in paragraph (c).
    (f) For the rate years beginning on July 1, 1997, July 1, 1998, and July 1, 1999, a nursing facility
licensed for 40 beds effective May 1, 1992, with a subsequent increase of 20 Medicare/Medicaid
certified beds, effective January 26, 1993, in accordance with an increase in licensure is exempt
from paragraphs (a) and (b).

facility and at facilities in the surrounding area, as determined under clause (3);

in this paragraph who is eligible to retire prior to age 65. The commissioner and the exclusive
representative of state employees shall enter into agreements under section 179A.22 to identify
employees whose positions are in programs that are being permanently eliminated or reduced due
to federal or state policies or practices. Failure to reach agreement identifying these employees is
not subject to impasse procedures provided in chapter 179A. The commissioner must prepare a
plan identifying eligible employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement in accordance
with the process outlined in section 43A.18, subdivisions 2 and 3. For purposes of this paragraph,
a person retires when the person terminates active employment in state service and applies for a
retirement annuity. Eligibility ends as provided in the agreement or plan, but must cease at the end
of the month in which the retired employee chooses not to receive an annuity, or the employee is
eligible for employer-paid health insurance from a new employer. The retired employees shall be
eligible for coverages to which they were entitled at the time of retirement, subject to any changes
in coverage through collective bargaining or plans established under section 43A.18 for employees
in positions equivalent to that from which they retired, provided that the retired employees shall not
be eligible for state-paid life insurance;

July 1, 2003, under section 116O.05, subdivision 4, as paid for by the supporting organization.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 43A.24, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4. Members of the state legislature. (a) A member of the state legislature is eligible for
state paid life insurance and hospital, medical, and dental benefits.
    (b) For purposes of life insurance, eligibility shall be as determined in applicable collective
bargaining agreements or by the commissioner or by plans established pursuant to section 43A.18,
subdivision 6. Coverages made available, including optional coverages, are as contained in the plan
established pursuant to section 43A.18, subdivision 2.
    (c) For purposes of hospital, medical, and dental benefits, coverage shall be available through
the healthy Minnesota contribution program established under section 43A.245. The commissioner
shall determine the defined contribution amount for each member and shall administer the defined
contributions in accordance with section 43A.245.
    (d) Any changes in benefits resulting in increased costs to the state shall not be effective until
expiration of the term of the members of the existing house of representatives. An eligible member
of the state legislature may decline to be enrolled for state paid coverages by filing a written waiver
with the commissioner. The waiver shall not prohibit the member from enrolling the member or
dependents for optional coverages, without cost to the state, as provided for in section 43A.26. A
member of the state legislature who returns from a leave of absence to a position previously occupied
in the civil service shall be eligible to receive the life insurance and hospital, medical, and dental
benefits to which the position is entitled.
   (e) This subdivision expires June 30, 2014."

System correctional employee retirement plan or the State Patrol retirement fund, who has at least
20 years of state service and retires, earlier than required, within 60 days of March 23, 1982. For
purposes of this clause, a person retires when the person terminates active employment in state or
University of Minnesota service and applies for a retirement annuity. Eligibility shall cease when
the retired employee attains the age of 65, or when the employee chooses not to receive the annuity
that the employee has applied for. The retired employee shall be eligible for coverages to which
the employee was entitled at the time of retirement, subject to any changes in coverage through
collective bargaining or plans established pursuant to section 43A.18, for employees in positions
equivalent to that from which retired, provided that the retired employee shall not be eligible for
state-paid life insurance. Coverages shall be coordinated with relevant health insurance benefits
provided through the federally sponsored Medicare program;

    (­)
     i­ (h) an employee of an agency of the state of Minnesota identified through the process provided
in this paragraph who is eligible to retire prior to age 65. The commissioner and the exclusive
representative of state employees shall enter into agreements under section 179A.22 to identify
employees whose positions are in programs that are being permanently eliminated or reduced due
to federal or state policies or practices. Failure to reach agreement identifying these employees is
not subject to impasse procedures provided in chapter 179A. The commissioner must prepare a
plan identifying eligible employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement in accordance
with the process outlined in section 43A.18, subdivisions 2 and 3. For purposes of this paragraph,
a person retires when the person terminates active employment in state service and applies for a
retirement annuity. Eligibility ends as provided in the agreement or plan, but must cease at the end
of the month in which the retired employee chooses not to receive an annuity, or the employee is
eligible for employer-paid health insurance from a new employer. The retired employees shall be
eligible for coverages to which they were entitled at the time of retirement, subject to any changes
in coverage through collective bargaining or plans established under section 43A.18 for employees
in positions equivalent to that from which they retired, provided that the retired employees shall not
be eligible for state-paid life insurance;

    j­ (i) employees of the state Board of Public Defense, with eligibility determined by the state
Board of Public Defense in consultation with the commissioner of management and budget; and

July 1, 2003, under section 116O.05, subdivision 4, as paid for by the supporting organization.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 43A.24, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4. Members of the state legislature. (a) A member of the state legislature is eligible for
state paid life insurance and hospital, medical, and dental benefits.
    (b) For purposes of life insurance, eligibility shall be as determined in applicable collective
bargaining agreements or by the commissioner or by plans established pursuant to section 43A.18,
subdivision 6. Coverages made available, including optional coverages, are as contained in the plan
established pursuant to section 43A.18, subdivision 2.
    (c) For purposes of hospital, medical, and dental benefits, coverage shall be available through
the healthy Minnesota contribution program established under section 256L.031. A member of the
state legislature is not required to enroll in the MinnesotaCare program to be eligible for the healthy
Minnesota contribution program. The commissioner shall determine the defined contribution
amount for each member and shall administer the defined contributions in accordance with section

256L.031.
    (d) Any changes in benefits resulting in increased costs to the state shall not be effective until
expiration of the term of the members of the existing house of representatives. An eligible member
of the state legislature may decline to be enrolled for state paid coverages by filing a written waiver
with the commissioner. The waiver shall not prohibit the member from enrolling the member or
dependents for optional coverages, without cost to the state, as provided for in section 43A.26. A
member of the state legislature who returns from a leave of absence to a position previously occupied
in the civil service shall be eligible to receive the life insurance and hospital, medical, and dental
benefits to which the position is entitled."

   Senator Robling from the Committee on Finance, to which was referred
   S.F. No. 1244: A bill for an act relating to environment; modifying the Wetland Conservation
Act; providing for state environmental permit coordination and management; modifying certain
environmental review procedures; authorizing consumptive use of water; requiring rulemaking;
amending Minnesota Statutes 2010, sections 103G.005, subdivision 10e, by adding a subdivision;
103G.2212; 103G.222, subdivision 3; 103G.2242, subdivisions 2a, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, by adding
subdivisions; 103G.2251; 116D.04, subdivision 2a, as amended; proposing coding for new law in
Minnesota Statutes, chapters 103G; 116C.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Page 2, delete section 4 and insert:
   "Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103G.222, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Requirements. (a) Wetlands must not be drained or filled, wholly or partially,
unless replaced by restoring or creating wetland areas of at least equal public value under
a replacement plan approved as provided in section 103G.2242, a replacement plan under a
local governmental unit's comprehensive wetland protection and management plan approved by
the board under section 103G.2243, or, if a permit to mine is required under section 93.481,
under a mining reclamation plan approved by the commissioner under the permit to mine. For
project-specific wetland replacement completed prior to wetland impacts authorized or conducted
under a permit to mine within the Great Lakes and Rainy River watershed basins, those basins
shall be considered a single watershed for purposes of determining wetland replacement ratios.
Mining reclamation plans shall apply the same principles and standards for replacing wetlands by
restoration or creation of wetland areas that are applicable to mitigation plans approved as provided
in section 103G.2242. Public value must be determined in accordance with section 103B.3355 or
a comprehensive wetland protection and management plan established under section 103G.2243.
Sections 103G.221 to 103G.2372 also apply to excavation in permanently and semipermanently
flooded areas of types 3, 4, and 5 wetlands.
   (b) Replacement must be guided by the following principles in descending order of priority:
   (1) avoiding the direct or indirect impact of the activity that may destroy or diminish the wetland;
   (2) minimizing the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the wetland activity and its
implementation;
   (3) rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected wetland
environment;
   (4) reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations
during the life of the activity;

   (5) compensating for the impact by restoring a wetland; and
   (6) compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute wetland resources or
environments.
    For a project involving the draining or filling of wetlands in an amount not exceeding 10,000
square feet more than the applicable amount in section 103G.2241, subdivision 9, paragraph (a), the
local government unit may make an on-site sequencing determination without a written alternatives
analysis from the applicant.
    (c) If a wetland is located in a cultivated field, then replacement must be accomplished through
restoration only without regard to the priority order in paragraph (b), provided that a deed restriction
is placed on the altered wetland prohibiting nonagricultural use for at least ten years.
    (d) If a wetland is drained under section 103G.2241, subdivision 2, paragraphs (b) and (e),
the local government unit may require a deed restriction that prohibits nonagricultural use for at
least ten years unless the drained wetland is replaced as provided under this section. The local
government unit may require the deed restriction if it determines the wetland area drained is at risk
of conversion to a nonagricultural use within ten years based on the zoning classification, proximity
to a municipality or full service road, or other criteria as determined by the local government unit.
   (e) Restoration and replacement of wetlands must be accomplished in accordance with the
ecology of the landscape area affected and ponds that are created primarily to fulfill storm water
management, and water quality treatment requirements may not be used to satisfy replacement
requirements under this chapter unless the design includes pretreatment of runoff and the pond is
functioning as a wetland.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraph (g), for a wetland or public waters wetland located on
nonagricultural land, replacement must be in the ratio of two acres of replaced wetland for each
acre of drained or filled wetland.
    (g) For a wetland or public waters wetland located on agricultural land or in a greater than 80
percent area, replacement must be in the ratio of one acre of replaced wetland for each acre of
drained or filled wetland.
    (h) Wetlands that are restored or created as a result of an approved replacement plan are subject
to the provisions of this section for any subsequent drainage or filling.
    (i) Except in a greater than 80 percent area, only wetlands that have been restored from
previously drained or filled wetlands, wetlands created by excavation in nonwetlands, wetlands
created by dikes or dams along public or private drainage ditches, or wetlands created by dikes
or dams associated with the restoration of previously drained or filled wetlands may be used in a
statewide banking program established in rules adopted under section 103G.2242, subdivision 1.
Modification or conversion of nondegraded naturally occurring wetlands from one type to another
are not eligible for enrollment in a statewide wetlands bank.
    (j) The Technical Evaluation Panel established under section 103G.2242, subdivision 2,
shall ensure that sufficient time has occurred for the wetland to develop wetland characteristics
of soils, vegetation, and hydrology before recommending that the wetland be deposited in the
statewide wetland bank. If the Technical Evaluation Panel has reason to believe that the wetland
characteristics may change substantially, the panel shall postpone its recommendation until the

wetland has stabilized.
    (k) This section and sections 103G.223 to 103G.2242, 103G.2364, and 103G.2365 apply to the
state and its departments and agencies.
    (l) For projects involving draining or filling of wetlands associated with a new public
transportation project, and for projects expanded solely for additional traffic capacity, public
transportation authorities may purchase credits from the board at the cost to the board to establish
credits. Proceeds from the sale of credits provided under this paragraph are appropriated to the
board for the purposes of this paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, "transportation
project" does not include an airport project.
     (m) A replacement plan for wetlands is not required for individual projects that result in the
filling or draining of wetlands for the repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or replacement of a
currently serviceable existing state, city, county, or town public road necessary, as determined by the
public transportation authority, to meet state or federal design or safety standards or requirements,
excluding new roads or roads expanded solely for additional traffic capacity lanes. This paragraph
only applies to authorities for public transportation projects that:
   (1) minimize the amount of wetland filling or draining associated with the project and consider
mitigating important site-specific wetland functions on site;
     (2) except as provided in clause (3), submit project-specific reports to the board, the Technical
Evaluation Panel, the commissioner of natural resources, and members of the public requesting a
copy at least 30 days prior to construction that indicate the location, amount, and type of wetlands to
be filled or drained by the project or, alternatively, convene an annual meeting of the parties required
to receive notice to review projects to be commenced during the upcoming year; and
    (3) for minor and emergency maintenance work impacting less than 10,000 square feet, submit
project-specific reports, within 30 days of commencing the activity, to the board that indicate the
location, amount, and type of wetlands that have been filled or drained.
    Those required to receive notice of public transportation projects may appeal minimization,
delineation, and on-site mitigation decisions made by the public transportation authority to the board
according to the provisions of section 103G.2242, subdivision 9. The Technical Evaluation Panel
shall review minimization and delineation decisions made by the public transportation authority and
provide recommendations regarding on-site mitigation if requested to do so by the local government
unit, a contiguous landowner, or a member of the Technical Evaluation Panel.
     Except for state public transportation projects, for which the state Department of Transportation
is responsible, the board must replace the wetlands, and wetland areas of public waters if authorized
by the commissioner or a delegated authority, drained or filled by public transportation projects on
existing roads.
    Public transportation authorities at their discretion may deviate from federal and state design
standards on existing road projects when practical and reasonable to avoid wetland filling or
draining, provided that public safety is not unreasonably compromised. The local road authority
and its officers and employees are exempt from liability for any tort claim for injury to persons or
property arising from travel on the highway and related to the deviation from the design standards
for construction or reconstruction under this paragraph. This paragraph does not preclude an action

for damages arising from negligence in construction or maintenance on a highway.
    (n) If a landowner seeks approval of a replacement plan after the proposed project has already
affected the wetland, the local government unit may require the landowner to replace the affected
wetland at a ratio not to exceed twice the replacement ratio otherwise required.
   (o) A local government unit may request the board to reclassify a county or watershed on
the basis of its percentage of presettlement wetlands remaining. After receipt of satisfactory
documentation from the local government, the board shall change the classification of a county
or watershed. If requested by the local government unit, the board must assist in developing the
documentation. Within 30 days of its action to approve a change of wetland classifications, the
board shall publish a notice of the change in the Environmental Quality Board Monitor.
   (p) One hundred citizens who reside within the jurisdiction of the local government unit may
request the local government unit to reclassify a county or watershed on the basis of its percentage of
presettlement wetlands remaining. In support of their petition, the citizens shall provide satisfactory
documentation to the local government unit. The local government unit shall consider the petition
and forward the request to the board under paragraph (o) or provide a reason why the petition is
denied.

replacement opportunities" are defined as opportunities that:
   (1) take advantage of naturally occurring hydrogeomorphological conditions and require
minimal landscape alteration;
      (2) have a high likelihood of becoming a functional wetland that will continue in perpetuity;
   (3) do not adversely affect other habitat types or ecological communities that are important in
maintaining the overall biological diversity of the area; and
    (4) are available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing
technology, and logistics consistent with overall project purposes.
    (e) Applicants and local government units shall rely on board-approved comprehensive
inventories of replacement opportunities and watershed conditions, including the Northeast
Minnesota Wetland Mitigation Inventory and Assessment (January 2010), in determining whether
reasonable, practicable, and environmentally beneficial replacement opportunities are available.

restoration shall collaborate to identify potential replacement opportunities within their
jurisdictional areas."
