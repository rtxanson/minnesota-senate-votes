The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
    We, the undersigned conferees for H. F. No. 2738 report that we have agreed upon the items in

   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PROPOSED.
   An amendment to the Minnesota Constitution is proposed to the people. If the amendment is
adopted, article VII, section 1, will read:
    Section 1. (a) Every person 18 years of age or more who has been a citizen of the United States
for three months and who has resided in the precinct for 30 days next preceding an election shall be
entitled to vote in that precinct. The place of voting by one otherwise qualified who has changed his

shall not be entitled or permitted to vote at any election in this state: A person not meeting the above

    (b) All voters voting in person must present valid government-issued photographic identification
before receiving a ballot. The state must issue photographic identification at no charge to an eligible

unable to present government-issued photographic identification must be permitted to submit a
provisional ballot. A provisional ballot must only be counted if the voter certifies the provisional
ballot in the manner provided by law.
   (c) All voters, including those not voting in person, must be subject to substantially equivalent
identity and eligibility verification prior to a ballot being cast or counted.
   Sec. 2. SUBMISSION TO VOTERS.

If approved, the amendment is effective July 1, 2013, for all voting at elections scheduled to be
conducted November 5, 2013, and thereafter. The question submitted must be:
    "Shall the Minnesota Constitution be amended to require all voters to present valid photo
identification to vote and to require the state to provide free identification to eligible voters,
effective July 1, 2013?
                                                                Yes .....................

   (b) The title required under Minnesota Statutes, section 204D.15, subdivision 1, for the question

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.26, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. Short taxable year. (a) A corporation or an entity with a short taxable year of less than
12 months, but at least four months, must pay estimated tax in equal installments on or before the
15th day of the third, sixth, ninth, and final month of the short taxable year, to the extent applicable
based on the number of months in the short taxable year.
   (b) A corporation or an entity is not required to make estimated tax payments for a short taxable
year unless its tax liability before the first day of the last month of the taxable year can reasonably
be expected to exceed $500.
   (c) No payment is required for a short taxable year of less than four months.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.26, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
  Subd. 7. Required installments. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the
amount of a required installment is 25 percent of the required annual payment.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the term "required annual payment" means
the lesser of:
   (1) 100 percent of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year, or, if no return is filed, 100
percent of the tax for that year; or
    (2) 100 percent of the tax shown on the return of the corporation or entity for the preceding
taxable year provided the return was for a full 12-month period, showed a liability, and was filed by
the corporation or entity.
    (c) Except for determining the first required installment for any taxable year, paragraph (b),
clause (2), does not apply in the case of a large corporation. The term "large corporation" means
a corporation or any predecessor corporation that had taxable net income of $1,000,000 or more
for any taxable year during the testing period. The term "testing period" means the three taxable
years immediately preceding the taxable year involved. A reduction allowed to a large corporation
for the first installment that is allowed by applying paragraph (b), clause (2), must be recaptured by
increasing the next required installment by the amount of the reduction.
    (d) In the case of a required installment, if the corporation or entity establishes that the annualized
income installment is less than the amount determined in paragraph (a), the amount of the required
installment is the annualized income installment and the recapture of previous quarters' reductions
allowed by this paragraph must be recovered by increasing later required installments to the extent
the reductions have not previously been recovered.
   (e) The "annualized income installment" is the excess, if any, of:
    (1) an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the tax for the taxable year computed by
placing on an annualized basis the taxable income:
   (i) for the first two months of the taxable year, in the case of the first required installment;
   (ii) for the first two months or for the first five months of the taxable year, in the case of the
second required installment;
    (iii) for the first six months or for the first eight months of the taxable year, in the case of the
third required installment; and
   (iv) for the first nine months or for the first 11 months of the taxable year, in the case of the
fourth required installment, over
   (2) the aggregate amount of any prior required installments for the taxable year.
   (3) For the purpose of this paragraph, the annualized income shall be computed by placing on
an annualized basis the taxable income for the year up to the end of the month preceding the due

date for the quarterly payment multiplied by 12 and dividing the resulting amount by the number of
months in the taxable year (2, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 11 as the case may be) referred to in clause (1).
   (4) The "applicable percentage" used in clause (1) is:
        For the following                                The applicable
        required installments:                           percentage is:

    (f)(1) If this paragraph applies, the amount determined for any installment must be determined
in the following manner:
   (i) take the taxable income for the months during the taxable year preceding the filing month;
   (ii) divide that amount by the base period percentage for the months during the taxable year
preceding the filing month;
   (iii) determine the tax on the amount determined under item (ii); and
   (iv) multiply the tax computed under item (iii) by the base period percentage for the filing month
and the months during the taxable year preceding the filing month.
   (2) For purposes of this paragraph:
   (i) the "base period percentage" for a period of months is the average percent that the taxable
income for the corresponding months in each of the three preceding taxable years bears to the taxable
income for the three preceding taxable years;
   (ii) the term "filing month" means the month in which the installment is required to be paid;
    (iii) this paragraph only applies if the base period percentage for any six consecutive months of
the taxable year equals or exceeds 70 percent; and
    (iv) the commissioner may provide by rule for the determination of the base period percentage
in the case of reorganizations, new corporations or entities, and other similar circumstances.
    (3) In the case of a required installment determined under this paragraph, if the corporation
or entity determines that the installment is less than the amount determined in paragraph (a), the
amount of the required installment is the amount determined under this paragraph and the recapture
of previous quarters' reductions allowed by this paragraph must be recovered by increasing later
required installments to the extent the reductions have not previously been recovered.

7, the commissioner may recompute the tax, including a refund, based on information available to
the commissioner. The tax may be recomputed within six years after the time period provided by
subdivision 8, notwithstanding any period of limitations to the contrary.

limited to only those changes that are required to be made to the return which relate to the changes
made on the federal return. This subdivision does not apply to sales and use tax.

      Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.42, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Federal extensions. When a taxpayer consents to an extension of time for the
assessment of federal withholding or income taxes, the period in which the commissioner may
recompute the tax is also extended, notwithstanding any period of limitations to the contrary, as
follows:
      (1) for the periods provided in section 289A.38, subdivisions 8 and 9;
    (2) for six months following the expiration of the extended federal period of limitations when no
change is made by the federal authority. If no change is made by the federal authority, and, but for this
subdivision, the commissioner's time period to adjust the tax has expired, and if the commissioner
has completed a field audit of the taxpayer, no additional changes resulting in additional tax due or
a refund may be made. F      ­o

and tax preference items in sections 56, 57, 58, and 59(d), (e), (f), and (h) of the Internal Revenue
Code. If a corporation files a separate company Minnesota tax return, the minimum tax must be
computed on a separate company basis. If a corporation is part of a tax group filing a unitary return,
the minimum tax must be computed on a unitary basis. The following adjustments must be made.
    (1) For purposes of the depreciation adjustments under section 56(a)(1) and 56(g)(4)(A) of
the Internal Revenue Code, the basis for depreciable property placed in service in a taxable year
beginning before January 1, 1990, is the adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes, including
any modification made in a taxable year under section 290.01, subdivision 19e, or Minnesota
Statutes 1986, section 290.09, subdivision 7, paragraph (c).
   For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, the amount of any remaining modification
made under section 290.01, subdivision 19e, or Minnesota Statutes 1986, section 290.09,
subdivision 7, paragraph (c), not previously deducted is a depreciation allowance in the first taxable
year after December 31, 2000.
    (2) The portion of the depreciation deduction allowed for federal income tax purposes under
section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code that is required as an addition under section 290.01,
subdivision 19c, clause ­
                        (1
                         ­5­­
                            ) (14), is disallowed in determining alternative minimum taxable income.
   (3) The subtraction for depreciation allowed under section 290.01, subdivision 19d, clause ­
                                                                                              (1

(16), is allowed as a depreciation deduction in determining alternative minimum taxable income.
    (4) The alternative tax net operating loss deduction under sections 56(a)(4) and 56(d) of the
Internal Revenue Code does not apply.
   (5) The special rule for certain dividends under section 56(g)(4)(C)(ii) of the Internal Revenue
Code does not apply.

December 31, 1986, shall be a net operating loss carryover to each of the 15 taxable years following
the taxable year of such loss; (ii) beginning before January 1, 1987, shall be a net operating loss
carryover to each of the five taxable years following the taxable year of such loss subject to the
provisions of Minnesota Statutes 1986, section 290.095; and (iii) beginning before January 1, 1987,
shall be a net operating loss carryback to each of the three taxable years preceding the loss year
subject to the provisions of Minnesota Statutes 1986, section 290.095.
    (b) The entire amount of the net operating loss for any taxable year shall be carried to the earliest
of the taxable years to which such loss may be carried. The portion of such loss which shall be carried
to each of the other taxable years shall be the excess, if any, of the amount of such loss over the sum
of the taxable net income, adjusted by the modifications specified in subdivision 4, for each of the
taxable years to which such loss may be carried.
    (c) Where a corporation apportions its income under the provisions of section 290.191, the
net operating loss deduction incurred in any taxable year shall be allowed to the extent of the
apportionment ratio of the loss year, plus the loss assigned by section 290.17, subdivision 2.

    (d) The provisions of sections 381, 382, and 384 of the Internal Revenue Code apply to
carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions and special limitations on net operating loss carryovers.

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290.17, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Unitary business principle. (a) If a trade or business conducted wholly within this
state or partly within and partly without this state is part of a unitary business, the entire income
of the unitary business is subject to apportionment pursuant to section 290.191. Notwithstanding
subdivision 2, paragraph (c), none of the income of a unitary business is considered to be derived
from any particular source and none may be allocated to a particular place except as provided by
the applicable apportionment formula. The provisions of this subdivision do not apply to business
income subject to subdivision 5, income of an insurance company, or income of an investment
company determined under section 290.36.
    (b) The term "unitary business" means business activities or operations which result in a flow of
value between them. The term may be applied within a single legal entity or between multiple entities
and without regard to whether each entity is a sole proprietorship, a corporation, a partnership or a
trust.
    (c) Unity is presumed whenever there is unity of ownership, operation, and use, evidenced by
centralized management or executive force, centralized purchasing, advertising, accounting, or other
controlled interaction, but the absence of these centralized activities will not necessarily evidence
a nonunitary business. Unity is also presumed when business activities or operations are of mutual
benefit, dependent upon or contributory to one another, either individually or as a group.
    (d) Where a business operation conducted in Minnesota is owned by a business entity that carries
on business activity outside the state different in kind from that conducted within this state, and the
other business is conducted entirely outside the state, it is presumed that the two business operations
are unitary in nature, interrelated, connected, and interdependent unless it can be shown to the
contrary.

    (g) The adjusted net income of a foreign operating corporation shall be deemed to be paid as
a dividend on the last day of its taxable year to each shareholder thereof, in proportion to each
shareholder's ownership, with which such corporation is engaged in a unitary business. Such deemed
dividend shall be treated as a dividend under section 290.21, subdivision 4.
    Dividends actually paid by a foreign operating corporation to a corporate shareholder which is a
member of the same unitary business as the foreign operating corporation shall be eliminated from
the net income of the unitary business in preparing a combined report for the unitary business. The
adjusted net income of a foreign operating corporation shall be its net income adjusted as follows:
    (1) any taxes paid or accrued to a foreign country, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a United
States possession or political subdivision of any of the foregoing shall be a deduction; and
    (2) the subtraction from federal taxable income for payments received from foreign corporations
or foreign operating corporations under section 290.01, subdivision 19d, clause (10), shall not be
allowed.
   If a foreign operating corporation incurs a net loss, neither income nor deduction from that
corporation shall be included in determining the net income of the unitary business.
    (h) For purposes of determining the net income of a unitary business and the factors to be used in
the apportionment of net income pursuant to section 290.191 or 290.20, there must be included only
the income and apportionment factors of domestic corporations or other domestic entities other than
foreign operating corporations that are determined to be part of the unitary business pursuant to this
subdivision, notwithstanding that foreign corporations or other foreign entities might be included in
the unitary business.

not be disallowed.
    (j) Each corporation or other entity, except a sole proprietorship, that is part of a unitary business
must file combined reports as the commissioner determines. On the reports, all intercompany
transactions between entities included pursuant to paragraph (h) must be eliminated and the entire
net income of the unitary business determined in accordance with this subdivision is apportioned
among the entities by using each entity's Minnesota factors for apportionment purposes in the
numerators of the apportionment formula and the total factors for apportionment purposes of all
entities included pursuant to paragraph (h) in the denominators of the apportionment formula.
   (k) If a corporation has been divested from a unitary business and is included in a combined
report for a fractional part of the common accounting period of the combined report:
    (1) its income includable in the combined report is its income incurred for that part of the year
determined by proration or separate accounting; and
   (2) its sales, property, and payroll included in the apportionment formula must be prorated or
accounted for separately.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

appraisal assignment, or preparing an appraisal report as defined in section 82B.021, subdivisions
2, 4, 6, and 7, on any property within the assessment jurisdiction where the individual is employed
or performing the duties of the assessor under contract. Violation of this prohibition shall result in

immediate revocation of the individual's license to assess property for property tax purposes. This
prohibition must not be construed to prohibit an individual from carrying out any duties required
for the proper assessment of property for property tax purposes or performing duties enumerated in
section 273.061, subdivision 7 or 8. If a formal resolution has been adopted by the governing body of
a governmental unit, which specifies the purposes for which such work will be done, this prohibition
does not apply to appraisal activities undertaken on behalf of and at the request of the governmental
unit that has employed or contracted with the individual. The resolution may only allow appraisal
activities which are related to condemnations, right-of-way acquisitions, land exchanges, or special
assessments.

     Subdivision 1. Authority. (a) The commissioner may abate, reduce, or refund any penalty or
interest that is imposed by a law administered by the commissioner, or imposed by section 270.0725,
subdivision 1 or 2, or 270.075, as a result of the late payment of tax or late filing of a return, or any
part of an additional tax charge under section 289A.25, subdivision 2, or 289A.26, subdivision 4,
if the failure to timely pay the tax or failure to timely file the return is due to reasonable cause, or
if the taxpayer is located in a presidentially declared disaster or in a presidentially declared state of
emergency area or in an area declared to be in a state of emergency by the governor under section
12.31.
   (b) The commissioner shall abate any part of a penalty or additional tax charge under section
289A.25, subdivision 2, or 289A.26, subdivision 4, attributable to erroneous advice given to the
taxpayer in writing by an employee of the department acting in an official capacity, if the advice:
      (1) was reasonably relied on and was in response to a specific written request of the taxpayer;
and
      (2) was not the result of failure by the taxpayer to provide adequate or accurate information.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
      Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 272.01, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

property which is exempt from ad valorem taxes, and taxes in lieu thereof, is leased, loaned, or
otherwise made available and used by a private individual, association, or corporation in connection
with a business conducted for profit, there shall be imposed a tax, for the privilege of so using or
possessing such real or personal property, in the same amount and to the same extent as though the
lessee or user was the owner of such property.
      (b) The tax imposed by this subdivision shall not apply to:
   (1) property leased or used as a concession in or relative to the use in whole or part of a public
park, market, fairgrounds, port authority, economic development authority established under chapter
469, municipal auditorium, municipal parking facility, municipal museum, or municipal stadium;
      (2) property of an airport owned by a city, town, county, or group thereof which is:
5664                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [100TH DAY

   (i) leased to or used by any person or entity including a fixed base operator; and
    (ii) used as a hangar for the storage or repair of aircraft or to provide aviation goods, services,
or facilities to the airport or general public;
the exception from taxation provided in this clause does not apply to:
    (i) property located at an airport owned or operated by the Metropolitan Airports Commission
or by a city of over 50,000 population according to the most recent federal census or such a city's
airport authority; or
   (ii) hangars leased by a private individual, association, or corporation in connection with a
business conducted for profit other than an aviation-related business;
   (3) property constituting or used as a public pedestrian ramp or concourse in connection with a
public airport;
    (4) property constituting or used as a passenger check-in area or ticket sale counter, boarding
area, or luggage claim area in connection with a public airport but not the airports owned or operated
by the Metropolitan Airports Commission or cities of over 50,000 population or an airport authority
therein. Real estate owned by a municipality in connection with the operation of a public airport
and leased or used for agricultural purposes is not exempt;
   (5) property leased, loaned, or otherwise made available to a private individual, corporation, or
association under a cooperative farming agreement made pursuant to section 97A.135; or
   (6) property leased, loaned, or otherwise made available to a private individual, corporation, or
association under section 272.68, subdivision 4.
    (c) Taxes imposed by this subdivision are payable as in the case of personal property taxes
and shall be assessed to the lessees or users of real or personal property in the same manner as
taxes assessed to owners of real or personal property, except that such taxes shall not become a
lien against the property. When due, the taxes shall constitute a debt due from the lessee or user to
the state, township, city, county, and school district for which the taxes were assessed and shall be
collected in the same manner as personal property taxes. If property subject to the tax imposed by
this subdivision is leased or used jointly by two or more persons, each lessee or user shall be jointly
and severally liable for payment of the tax.
   (d) The tax on real property of the federal government, the state or any of its political
subdivisions that is leased by a private individual, association, or corporation and becomes taxable
under this subdivision or other provision of law must be assessed and collected as a personal
property assessment. The taxes do not become a lien against the real property.

   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 273.114, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Additional taxes. (a) When real property which is being, or has been valued and
assessed under this section is sold, transferred, or no longer qualifies under subdivision 2, the portion
sold, transferred, or no longer qualifying shall be subject to additional taxes in the amount equal
to the difference between the taxes determined in accordance with subdivision 3 and the amount
determined under subdivision 4, provided that the amount determined under subdivision 4 shall not
be greater than it would have been had the actual bona fide sale price of the real property at an
arm's-length transaction been used in lieu of the market value determined under subdivision 4. The
additional taxes shall be extended against the property on the tax list for taxes payable in the current
year, provided that no interest or penalties shall be levied on the additional taxes if timely paid and
provided that the additional taxes shall only be levied with respect to the current year plus two prior
years that the property has been valued and assessed under this section.
    (b) In the case of a sale or transfer, the additional taxes under paragraph (a) shall not be extended
against the property if the new owner submits a successful application by the later of May 1 of the
current year or 30 days after the sale or transfer.
   (c) For the purposes of this section, the following events do not constitute a sale or transfer for
property that qualified under subdivision 2 prior to the event:
   (1) death of a property owner when the surviving owners retain ownership of the property;
   (2) divorce of a married couple when one of the spouses retains ownership of the property;
  (3) marriage of a single property owner when that owner retains ownership of the property in
whole or in part;
    (4) the organization or reorganization of a farm ownership entity that is not prohibited from
owning agricultural land in this state under section 500.24, if all owners maintain the same beneficial
interest both before and after the organization or reorganization; and
    (5) transfer of the property to a trust or trustee, provided that the individual owners of the property
are the grantors of the trust and they maintain the same beneficial interest both before and after
placement of the property in trust.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.124, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
   Subd. 13. Homestead application. (a) A person who meets the homestead requirements
under subdivision 1 must file a homestead application with the county assessor to initially obtain
homestead classification.
    (b) The format and contents of a uniform homestead application shall be prescribed by the
commissioner of revenue. The application must clearly inform the taxpayer that this application
must be signed by all owners who occupy the property or by the qualifying relative and returned to
the county assessor in order for the property to receive homestead treatment.
    (c) Every property owner applying for homestead classification must furnish to the county
assessor the Social Security number of each occupant who is listed as an owner of the property
on the deed of record, the name and address of each owner who does not occupy the property,
5666                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [100TH DAY

and the name and Social Security number of each owner's spouse who occupies the property.
The application must be signed by each owner who occupies the property and by each owner's
spouse who occupies the property, or, in the case of property that qualifies as a homestead under
subdivision 1, paragraph (c), by the qualifying relative.
    If a property owner occupies a homestead, the property owner's spouse may not claim another
property as a homestead unless the property owner and the property owner's spouse file with the
assessor an affidavit or other proof required by the assessor stating that the property qualifies as a
homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (e).
    Owners or spouses occupying residences owned by their spouses and previously occupied with
the other spouse, either of whom fail to include the other spouse's name and Social Security number
on the homestead application or provide the affidavits or other proof requested, will be deemed
to have elected to receive only partial homestead treatment of their residence. The remainder of
the residence will be classified as nonhomestead residential. When an owner or spouse's name and
Social Security number appear on homestead applications for two separate residences and only one
application is signed, the owner or spouse will be deemed to have elected to homestead the residence
for which the application was signed.
    The Social Security numbers, state or federal tax returns or tax return information, including the
federal income tax schedule F, required by this section, ­ or section 273.13, and affidavits or other
proofs of the property owners and spouses submitted under this or another section to support a claim
for a property tax homestead classification or other classification or benefit under section 273.13,
are private data on individuals as defined by section 13.02, subdivision 12, or nonpublic data as
defined in section 13.02, subdivision 9, but, notwithstanding that section, the private and nonpublic
data may be disclosed to the commissioner of revenue, or, for purposes of proceeding under the
Revenue Recapture Act to recover personal property taxes owing, to the county treasurer.
    (d) If residential real estate is occupied and used for purposes of a homestead by a relative
of the owner and qualifies for a homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (c), in order for the
property to receive homestead status, a homestead application must be filed with the assessor. The
Social Security number of each relative and spouse of a relative occupying the property shall be
required on the homestead application filed under this subdivision. If a different relative of the
owner subsequently occupies the property, the owner of the property must notify the assessor within
30 days of the change in occupancy. The Social Security number of a relative or relative's spouse
occupying the property is private data on individuals as defined by section 13.02, subdivision 12,
but may be disclosed to the commissioner of revenue, or, for the purposes of proceeding under the
Revenue Recapture Act to recover personal property taxes owing, to the county treasurer.
    (e) The homestead application shall also notify the property owners that ­h        t­­

                                                             t if the property is granted homestead status
for any assessment year, that same property shall remain classified as homestead until the property
is sold or transferred to another person, or the owners, the spouse of the owner, or the relatives no
longer use the property as their homestead. Upon the sale or transfer of the homestead property, a
certificate of value must be timely filed with the county auditor as provided under section 272.115.
Failure to notify the assessor within 30 days that the property has been sold, transferred, or that the
owner, the spouse of the owner, or the relative is no longer occupying the property as a homestead,
shall result in the penalty provided under this subdivision and the property will lose its current
homestead status.

    Subd. 13a. Occupant list. ­ (g
                                 ­­) At the request of the commissioner, each county must give
the commissioner a list that includes the name and Social Security number of each occupant of
homestead property who is the property owner, property owner's spouse, qualifying relative of a
property owner, or a spouse of a qualifying relative. The commissioner shall use the information
provided on the lists as appropriate under the law, including for the detection of improper claims
by owners, or relatives of owners, under chapter 290A.

                                        ­­) (a) If the commissioner finds that a property owner may
be claiming a fraudulent homestead, the commissioner shall notify the appropriate counties. Within
90 days of the notification, the county assessor shall investigate to determine if the homestead
classification was properly claimed. If the property owner does not qualify, the county assessor
shall notify the county auditor who will determine the amount of homestead benefits that had been
improperly allowed. For the purpose of this ­  s­   t­o
                                                  c­i
                                                 e­   ­­n subdivision, "homestead benefits" means the
tax reduction resulting from the classification as a homestead under section 273.13, the taconite
homestead credit under section 273.135, the residential homestead and agricultural homestead
credits under section 273.1384, and the supplemental homestead credit under section 273.1391.
    The county auditor shall send a notice to the person who owned the affected property at the time
the homestead application related to the improper homestead was filed, demanding reimbursement
of the homestead benefits plus a penalty equal to 100 percent of the homestead benefits. The person
notified may appeal the county's determination by serving copies of a petition for review with county
officials as provided in section 278.01 and filing proof of service as provided in section 278.01 with
the Minnesota Tax Court within 60 days of the date of the notice from the county. Procedurally,
the appeal is governed by the provisions in chapter 271 which apply to the appeal of a property
tax assessment or levy, but without requiring any prepayment of the amount in controversy. If the
amount of homestead benefits and penalty is not paid within 60 days, and if no appeal has been
filed, the county auditor shall certify the amount of taxes and penalty to the county treasurer. The
county treasurer will add interest to the unpaid homestead benefits and penalty amounts at the rate
provided in section 279.03 for real property taxes becoming delinquent in the calendar year during
which the amount remains unpaid. Interest may be assessed for the period beginning 60 days after
demand for payment was made.
    If the person notified is the current owner of the property, the treasurer may add the total amount
of homestead benefits, penalty, interest, and costs to the ad valorem taxes otherwise payable on the
property by including the amounts on the property tax statements under section 276.04, subdivision
3. The amounts added under this paragraph to the ad valorem taxes shall include interest accrued
through December 31 of the year preceding the taxes payable year for which the amounts are first
added. These amounts, when added to the property tax statement, become subject to all the laws for
the enforcement of real or personal property taxes for that year, and for any subsequent year.
     If the person notified is not the current owner of the property, the treasurer may collect the
5668                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [100TH DAY

amounts due under the Revenue Recapture Act in chapter 270A, or use any of the powers granted
in sections 277.20 and 277.21 without exclusion, to enforce payment of the homestead benefits,
penalty, interest, and costs, as if those amounts were delinquent tax obligations of the person who
owned the property at the time the application related to the improperly allowed homestead was
filed. The treasurer may relieve a prior owner of personal liability for the homestead benefits, penalty,
interest, and costs, and instead extend those amounts on the tax lists against the property as provided
in this paragraph to the extent that the current owner agrees in writing. On all demands, billings,
property tax statements, and related correspondence, the county must list and state separately the
amounts of homestead benefits, penalty, interest and costs being demanded, billed or assessed.

     i­ (b) Any amount of homestead benefits recovered by the county from the property owner
shall be distributed to the county, city or town, and school district where the property is located
in the same proportion that each taxing district's levy was to the total of the three taxing districts'
levy for the current year. Any amount recovered attributable to taconite homestead credit shall be

     j­ (c) If a property owner has applied for more than one homestead and the county assessors
cannot determine which property should be classified as homestead, the county assessors will refer
the information to the commissioner. The commissioner shall make the determination and notify

ask the counties to furnish lists of all properties and the record owners. The Social Security numbers
and federal identification numbers that are maintained by a county or city assessor for property tax
administration purposes, and that may appear on the lists retain their classification as private or
nonpublic data; but may be viewed, accessed, and used by the county auditor or treasurer of the
same county for the limited purpose of assisting the commissioner in the preparation of microdata
samples under section 270C.12. The commissioner shall use the information provided on the lists
as appropriate under the law, including for the detection of improper claims by owners, or relatives
of owners, under chapter 290A.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 273.13, subdivision 23, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23. Class 2. (a) An agricultural homestead consists of class 2a agricultural land that is
homesteaded, along with any class 2b rural vacant land that is contiguous to the class 2a land under
the same ownership. The market value of the house and garage and immediately surrounding one
acre of land has the same class rates as class 1a or 1b property under subdivision 22. The value of the
remaining land including improvements up to the first tier valuation limit of agricultural homestead
property has a net class rate of 0.5 percent of market value. The remaining property over the first
tier has a class rate of one percent of market value. For purposes of this subdivision, the "first tier
valuation limit of agricultural homestead property" and "first tier" means the limit certified under
section 273.11, subdivision 23.
    (b) Class 2a agricultural land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
agricultural land and buildings. Class 2a property has a net class rate of one percent of market
value, unless it is part of an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a). Class 2a property must
also include any property that would otherwise be classified as 2b, but is interspersed with class
2a property, including but not limited to sloughs, wooded wind shelters, acreage abutting ditches,
ravines, rock piles, land subject to a setback requirement, and other similar land that is impractical
for the assessor to value separately from the rest of the property or that is unlikely to be able to
be sold separately from the rest of the property.
    An assessor may classify the part of a parcel described in this subdivision that is used for
agricultural purposes as class 2a and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use.
   (c) Class 2b rural vacant land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
unplatted real estate, rural in character and not used for agricultural purposes, including land
used for growing trees for timber, lumber, and wood and wood products, that is not improved
with a structure. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
5670                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [100TH DAY

commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
Any parcel of 20 acres or more improved with a structure that is not a minor, ancillary nonresidential
structure must be split-classified, and ten acres must be assigned to the split parcel containing the
structure. Class 2b property has a net class rate of one percent of market value unless it is part of
an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a), or qualifies as class 2c under paragraph (d).
    (d) Class 2c managed forest land consists of no less than 20 and no more than 1,920 acres
statewide per taxpayer that is being managed under a forest management plan that meets the
requirements of chapter 290C, but is not enrolled in the sustainable forest resource management
incentive program. It has a class rate of .65 percent, provided that the owner of the property must
apply to the assessor in order for the property to initially qualify for the reduced rate and provide
the information required by the assessor to verify that the property qualifies for the reduced rate.
If the assessor receives the application and information before May 1 in an assessment year, the
property qualifies beginning with that assessment year. If the assessor receives the application
and information after April 30 in an assessment year, the property may not qualify until the next
assessment year. The commissioner of natural resources must concur that the land is qualified. The
commissioner of natural resources shall annually provide county assessors verification information
on a timely basis. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
   (e) Agricultural land as used in this section means:
   (1) contiguous acreage of ten acres or more, used during the preceding year for agricultural
purposes; or
    (2) contiguous acreage used during the preceding year for an intensive livestock or poultry
confinement operation, provided that land used only for pasturing or grazing does not qualify under
this clause.
    "Agricultural purposes" as used in this section means the raising, cultivation, drying, or storage
of agricultural products for sale, or the storage of machinery or equipment used in support of
agricultural production by the same farm entity. For a property to be classified as agricultural
based only on the drying or storage of agricultural products, the products being dried or stored
must have been produced by the same farm entity as the entity operating the drying or storage
facility. "Agricultural purposes" also includes enrollment in the Reinvest in Minnesota program
under sections 103F.501 to 103F.535 or the federal Conservation Reserve Program as contained in
Public Law 99-198 or a similar state or federal conservation program if the property was classified
as agricultural (i) under this subdivision ­fo

because of its enrollment in a qualifying program and the land remains enrolled or (ii) in the year
prior to its enrollment. Agricultural classification shall not be based upon the market value of any
residential structures on the parcel or contiguous parcels under the same ownership.
    For the purposes of this paragraph, "contiguous acreage" means all of, or a contiguous portion
of, a tax parcel as defined in section 272.193, or all of, or a contiguous portion of, a set of contiguous
tax parcels under section 272.193 that are owned by the same person.

the cultivation of one or more fruits or vegetables or production of animal or other agricultural
products for sale to local markets by the farmer or an organization with which the farmer is affiliated.
For the purposes of this paragraph, "contiguous acreage" means all of a tax parcel as defined in
section 272.193, or, all of a set of contiguous tax parcels under section 272.193 that are owned by
the same person.
   (g) Land shall be classified as agricultural even if all or a portion of the agricultural use of that
property is the leasing to, or use by another person for agricultural purposes.
    Classification under this subdivision is not determinative for qualifying under section 273.111.
    (h) The property classification under this section supersedes, for property tax purposes only, any
locally administered agricultural policies or land use restrictions that define minimum or maximum
farm acreage.
    (i) The term "agricultural products" as used in this subdivision includes production for sale of:
   (1) livestock, dairy animals, dairy products, poultry and poultry products, fur-bearing animals,
horticultural and nursery stock, fruit of all kinds, vegetables, forage, grains, bees, and apiary
products by the owner;
   (2) fish bred for sale and consumption if the fish breeding occurs on land zoned for agricultural
use;
    (3) the commercial boarding of horses, which may include related horse training and riding
instruction, if the boarding is done on property that is also used for raising pasture to graze horses
or raising or cultivating other agricultural products as defined in clause (1);

for breeding stock on the property during the preceding year and that the owner provides a copy
of the owner's most recent schedule F; or (ii) for use on a shooting preserve licensed under section
97A.115;
   (6) insects primarily bred to be used as food for animals;
   (7) trees, grown for sale as a crop, including short rotation woody crops, and not sold for timber,
lumber, wood, or wood products; and
   (8) maple syrup taken from trees grown by a person licensed by the Minnesota Department of
Agriculture under chapter 28A as a food processor.
    (j) If a parcel used for agricultural purposes is also used for commercial or industrial purposes,
including but not limited to:
   (1) wholesale and retail sales;
   (2) processing of raw agricultural products or other goods;
   (3) warehousing or storage of processed goods; and
   (4) office facilities for the support of the activities enumerated in clauses (1), (2), and (3),
the assessor shall classify the part of the parcel used for agricultural purposes as class 1b, 2a, or 2b,
whichever is appropriate, and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use. The grading, sorting,
and packaging of raw agricultural products for first sale is considered an agricultural purpose. A
greenhouse or other building where horticultural or nursery products are grown that is also used for
the conduct of retail sales must be classified as agricultural if it is primarily used for the growing
of horticultural or nursery products from seed, cuttings, or roots and occasionally as a showroom
for the retail sale of those products. Use of a greenhouse or building only for the display of already
grown horticultural or nursery products does not qualify as an agricultural purpose.
    (k) The assessor shall determine and list separately on the records the market value of the
homestead dwelling and the one acre of land on which that dwelling is located. If any farm
buildings or structures are located on this homesteaded acre of land, their market value shall not be
included in this separate determination.
    (l) Class 2d airport landing area consists of a landing area or public access area of a privately
owned public use airport. It has a class rate of one percent of market value. To qualify for
classification under this paragraph, a privately owned public use airport must be licensed as a
public airport under section 360.018. For purposes of this paragraph, "landing area" means that part
of a privately owned public use airport properly cleared, regularly maintained, and made available
to the public for use by aircraft and includes runways, taxiways, aprons, and sites upon which are
situated landing or navigational aids. A landing area also includes land underlying both the primary
surface and the approach surfaces that comply with all of the following:
    (i) the land is properly cleared and regularly maintained for the primary purposes of the landing,
taking off, and taxiing of aircraft; but that portion of the land that contains facilities for servicing,
repair, or maintenance of aircraft is not included as a landing area;
   (ii) the land is part of the airport property; and

   (iii) the land is not used for commercial or residential purposes.
The land contained in a landing area under this paragraph must be described and certified by the
commissioner of transportation. The certification is effective until it is modified, or until the airport
or landing area no longer meets the requirements of this paragraph. For purposes of this paragraph,
"public access area" means property used as an aircraft parking ramp, apron, or storage hangar, or
an arrival and departure building in connection with the airport.
    (m) Class 2e consists of land with a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively being
mined and is not otherwise classified as class 2a or 2b, provided that the land is not located in a county
that has elected to opt-out of the aggregate preservation program as provided in section 273.1115,
subdivision 6. It has a class rate of one percent of market value. To qualify for classification under
this paragraph, the property must be at least ten contiguous acres in size and the owner of the property
must record with the county recorder of the county in which the property is located an affidavit
containing:
   (1) a legal description of the property;
   (2) a disclosure that the property contains a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively
being mined but is present on the entire parcel enrolled;
   (3) documentation that the conditional use under the county or local zoning ordinance of this
property is for mining; and
    (4) documentation that a permit has been issued by the local unit of government or the mining
activity is allowed under local ordinance. The disclosure must include a statement from a registered
professional geologist, engineer, or soil scientist delineating the deposit and certifying that it is a
commercial aggregate deposit.
   For purposes of this section and section 273.1115, "commercial aggregate deposit" means a
deposit that will yield crushed stone or sand and gravel that is suitable for use as a construction
aggregate; and "actively mined" means the removal of top soil and overburden in preparation for
excavation or excavation of a commercial deposit.
    (n) When any portion of the property under this subdivision or subdivision 22 begins to be
actively mined, the owner must file a supplemental affidavit within 60 days from the day any
aggregate is removed stating the number of acres of the property that is actively being mined.
The acres actively being mined must be (1) valued and classified under subdivision 24 in the next
subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource preservation property
tax program under section 273.1115, if the land was enrolled in that program. Copies of the
original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed with the county assessor, the local
zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Land and Minerals.
A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent portion of the property is actively
mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres, even if the actual mining activity
constitutes less than five acres.
   (o) The definitions prescribed by the commissioner under paragraphs (c) and (d) are not rules
and are exempt from the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14, and the provisions in section 14.386
concerning exempt rules do not apply.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 273.13, subdivision 25, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 25. Class 4. (a) Class 4a is residential real estate containing four or more units and used or
held for use by the owner or by the tenants or lessees of the owner as a residence for rental periods
of 30 days or more, excluding property qualifying for class 4d. Class 4a also includes hospitals
licensed under sections 144.50 to 144.56, other than hospitals exempt under section 272.02, and
contiguous property used for hospital purposes, without regard to whether the property has been
platted or subdivided. The market value of class 4a property has a class rate of 1.25 percent.
   (b) Class 4b includes:
   (1) residential real estate containing less than four units that does not qualify as class 4bb, other
than seasonal residential recreational property;
   (2) manufactured homes not classified under any other provision;
   (3) a dwelling, garage, and surrounding one acre of property on a nonhomestead farm classified
under subdivision 23, paragraph (b) containing two or three units; and
   (4) unimproved property that is classified residential as determined under subdivision 33.
   The market value of class 4b property has a class rate of 1.25 percent.
   (c) Class 4bb includes:
                         ­
   ­(1
     ­­) nonhomestead residential real estate containing one unit, other than seasonal residential
recreational property; and
   ­
   (2
    ­­) a single family dwelling, garage, and surrounding one acre of property on a nonhomestead
farm classified under subdivision 23, paragraph (b).
   Class 4bb property has the same class rates as class 1a property under subdivision 22.
    Property that has been classified as seasonal residential recreational property at any time during
which it has been owned by the current owner or spouse of the current owner does not qualify for
class 4bb.
   (d) Class 4c property includes:
    (1) except as provided in subdivision 22, paragraph (c), real and personal property devoted
to commercial temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes, for not
more than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment. For purposes of this clause,
property is devoted to a commercial purpose on a specific day if any portion of the property is
used for residential occupancy, and a fee is charged for residential occupancy. Class 4c property
under this clause must contain three or more rental units. A "rental unit" is defined as a cabin,
condominium, townhouse, sleeping room, or individual camping site equipped with water and
electrical hookups for recreational vehicles. A camping pad offered for rent by a property that
otherwise qualifies for class 4c under this clause is also class 4c under this clause regardless of the
term of the rental agreement, as long as the use of the camping pad does not exceed 250 days. In
order for a property to be classified under this clause, either (i) the business located on the property
must provide recreational activities, at least 40 percent of the annual gross lodging receipts related

least 60 percent of all paid bookings by lodging guests during the year must be for periods of at
least two consecutive nights; or (B) at least 20 percent of the annual gross receipts must be from

In order for a property to qualify for classification under this clause, the owner must submit a

the land on which they are located will be designated as class 3a. The owner of property desiring
designation as class 4c property under this clause must provide guest registers or other records
demonstrating that the units for which class 4c designation is sought were not occupied for more

(5) other nonresidential facility operated on a commercial basis not directly related to temporary
and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes does not qualify for class 4c. For the

   (ii) it meets the requirements of section 273.112, subdivision 3, paragraph (d).
   A structure used as a clubhouse, restaurant, or place of refreshment in conjunction with the golf
course is classified as class 3a property;
   (3) real property up to a maximum of three acres of land owned and used by a nonprofit

3, only the proportion of qualifying units to the total number of units in the building qualify for class
4d. The remaining portion of the building shall be classified by the assessor based upon its use. Class
4d also includes the same proportion of land as the qualifying low-income rental housing units are to

   Annually, the commissioner of revenue shall furnish a list to the county assessor containing the
names and Social Security numbers of persons who have applied for both homestead classification
under section 273.13 and a property tax refund as a renter under this chapter.
    Within 90 days of the notification, the county assessor shall investigate to determine if the

benefits that has been improperly allowed. For the purpose of this section, "homestead benefits" has

    If the amount of homestead benefits and penalty is not paid within 60 days, and if no appeal has
been filed, the county auditor shall certify the amount of taxes and penalty to the county treasurer.
The county treasurer will add interest to the unpaid homestead benefits and penalty amounts at the
rate provided for delinquent personal property taxes for the period beginning 60 days after demand
for payment was made until payment. If the person notified is the current owner of the property, the
treasurer may add the total amount of benefits, penalty, interest, and costs to the real estate taxes
otherwise payable on the property in the following year. If the person notified is not the current
owner of the property, the treasurer may collect the amounts due under the Revenue Recapture Act in
chapter 270A, or use any of the powers granted in sections 277.20 and 277.21 without exclusion, to
enforce payment of the benefits, penalty, interest, and costs, as if those amounts were delinquent tax
obligations of the person who owned the property at the time the application related to the improperly
allowed homestead was filed. The treasurer may relieve a prior owner of personal liability for the
benefits, penalty, interest, and costs, and instead extend those amounts on the tax lists against the
property for taxes payable in the following year to the extent that the current owner agrees in writing.
    Any amount of homestead benefits recovered by the county from the property owner shall be
distributed to the county, city or town, and school district where the property is located in the same
proportion that each taxing district's levy was to the total of the three taxing districts' levy for the
current year. Any amount recovered attributable to taconite homestead credit shall be transmitted
to the St. Louis County auditor to be deposited in the taconite property tax relief account. Any
amount recovered that is attributable to supplemental homestead credit is to be transmitted to the
commissioner of revenue for deposit in the general fund of the state treasury. The total amount of
penalty collected must be deposited in the county general fund.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290B.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Approval; recording. The commissioner shall approve all initial applications that
qualify under this chapter and shall notify qualifying homeowners on or before December 1. The
commissioner may investigate the facts or require confirmation in regard to an application. The
commissioner shall record or file a notice of qualification for deferral, including the names of the
qualifying homeowners and a legal description of the property, in the office of the county recorder,
or registrar of titles, whichever is applicable, in the county where the qualifying property is located.
The notice must state that it serves as a notice of lien and that it includes deferrals under this section
for future years. The commissioner shall prescribe the form of the notice. Execution of the notice by
the original or facsimile signature of the commissioner or a delegate entitles them to be recorded,
and no other attestation, certification, or acknowledgment is necessary. The homeowner shall pay
the recording or filing fees for the notice, which, notwithstanding section 357.18, shall be paid by
the homeowner at the time of satisfaction of the lien.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for notices that are both executed and recorded
after June 30, 2012.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 373.01, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

    (2) Acquire and hold real and personal property for the use of the county, and lands sold for
taxes as provided by law.
   (3) Purchase and hold for the benefit of the county real estate sold by virtue of judicial
proceedings, to which the county is a party.
    (4) Sell, lease, and convey real or personal estate owned by the county, and give contracts or
options to sell, lease, or convey it, and make orders respecting it as deemed conducive to the interests
of the county's inhabitants.
   (5) Make all contracts and do all other acts in relation to the property and concerns of the county
necessary to the exercise of its corporate powers.
    (b) No sale, lease, or conveyance of real estate owned by the county, except the lease of a
residence acquired for the furtherance of an approved capital improvement project, nor any contract
or option for it, shall be valid, without first advertising for bids or proposals in the official newspaper
of the county for three consecutive weeks and once in a newspaper of general circulation in the area
where the property is located. The notice shall state the time and place of considering the proposals,
contain a legal description of any real estate, and a brief description of any personal property. Leases
that do not exceed $15,000 for any one year may be negotiated and are not subject to the competitive
bid procedures of this section. All proposals estimated to exceed $15,000 in any one year shall be
considered at the time set for the bid opening, and the one most favorable to the county accepted,
but the county board may, in the interest of the county, reject any or all proposals.
    (c) Sales of personal property the value of which is estimated to be $15,000 or more shall be
made only after advertising for bids or proposals in the county's official newspaper, on the county's
Web site, or in a recognized industry trade journal. At the same time it posts on its Web site or
publishes in a trade journal, the county must publish in the official newspaper, either as part of the
minutes of a regular meeting of the county board or in a separate notice, a summary of all requests
for bids or proposals that the county advertises on its Web site or in a trade journal. After publication
in the official newspaper, on the Web site, or in a trade journal, bids or proposals may be solicited
and accepted by the electronic selling process authorized in section 471.345, subdivision 17. Sales
of personal property the value of which is estimated to be less than $15,000 may be made either
on competitive bids or in the open market, in the discretion of the county board. "Web site" means
a specific, addressable location provided on a server connected to the Internet and hosting World
Wide Web pages and other files that are generally accessible on the Internet all or most of a day.
    (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the county may, when acquiring real
property for county highway right-of-way, exchange parcels of real property of substantially
similar or equal value without advertising for bids. The estimated values for these parcels shall be
determined by the county assessor.
    (e) Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the county may, when acquiring real
property for purposes other than county highway right-of-way, exchange parcels of real property of
substantially similar or equal value without advertising for bids. The estimated values for these
parcels must be determined by the county assessor or a private appraisal performed by a licensed
Minnesota real estate appraiser. For the purpose of making these estimates, the county assessor
need not be licensed under chapter 82B. Before giving final approval to any exchange of land, the
county board shall hold a public hearing on the exchange. At least two weeks before the hearing,
the county auditor shall post a notice in the auditor's office and the official newspaper of the county
5686                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [100TH DAY

of the hearing that contains a description of the lands affected.
    (f) If real estate or personal property remains unsold after advertising for and consideration of
bids or proposals the county may employ a broker to sell the property. The broker may sell the
property for not less than 90 percent of its appraised market value as determined by the county. The
broker's fee shall be set by agreement with the county but may not exceed ten percent of the sale
price and must be paid from the proceeds of the sale.
    (g) A county or its agent may rent a county-owned residence acquired for the furtherance of
an approved capital improvement project subject to the conditions set by the county board and not
subject to the conditions for lease otherwise provided by paragraph (a), clause (4), and paragraphs
(b), (c), (d), (f), and (h).
    (h) In no case shall lands be disposed of without there being reserved to the county all iron ore
and other valuable minerals in and upon the lands, with right to explore for, mine and remove the
iron ore and other valuable minerals, nor shall the minerals and mineral rights be disposed of, either
before or after disposition of the surface rights, otherwise than by mining lease, in similar general
form to that provided by section 93.20 for mining leases affecting state lands. The lease shall be
for a term not exceeding 50 years, and be issued on a royalty basis, the royalty to be not less than
25 cents per ton of 2,240 pounds, and fix a minimum amount of royalty payable during each year,
whether mineral is removed or not. Prospecting options for mining leases may be granted for periods
not exceeding one year. The options shall require, among other things, periodical showings to the
county board of the results of exploration work done.
    (i) Notwithstanding anything in this subdivision to the contrary, the county may, when selling
real property owned in fee simple that cannot be improved because of noncompliance with local
ordinances regarding minimum area, shape, frontage, or access, proceed to sell the nonconforming
parcel without advertising for bid. At the county's discretion, the real property may be restricted
to sale to adjoining landowners or may be sold to any other interested party. The property shall be
sold to the highest bidder, but in no case shall the property be sold for less than 90 percent of its
fair market value as determined by the county assessor. All owners of land adjoining the land to be
sold shall be given a written notice at least 30 days before the sale. This paragraph shall be liberally
construed to encourage the sale of nonconforming real property and promote its return to the tax
roles.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 297A.665, is amended to read:
   297A.665 PRESUMPTION OF TAX; BURDEN OF PROOF.
    (a) For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to prevent evasion of the tax,
until the contrary is established, it is presumed that:
   (1) all gross receipts are subject to the tax; and
   (2) all retail sales for delivery in Minnesota are for storage, use, or other consumption in
Minnesota.
    (b) The burden of proving that a sale is not a taxable retail sale is on the seller. However, a seller
is relieved of liability if:
    (1) the seller obtains a fully completed exemption certificate or all the relevant information
required by section 297A.72, subdivision 2, at the time of the sale or within 90 days after the date
of the sale; or
    (2) if the seller has not obtained a fully completed exemption certificate or all the relevant
information required by section 297A.72, subdivision 2, within the time provided in clause (1),
within 120 days after a request for substantiation by the commissioner, the seller either:

available on the date of the transaction, (B) could be applicable to the item for which the exemption
is claimed, and (C) is reasonable for the purchaser's type of business; or
   (ii) proves by other means that the transaction was not subject to tax.

     (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), relief from liability does not apply to a seller who:
     (1) fraudulently fails to collect the tax; or
     (2) solicits purchasers to participate in the unlawful claim of an exemption.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), relief from liability does not apply to a seller who has
obtained information under paragraph (b), clause (2), if through the audit process the commissioner
finds the following:
    (1) that at the time the information was provided the seller had knowledge or had reason to know
that the information relating to the exemption was materially false; or
   (2) that the seller knowingly participated in activity intended to purposefully evade the sales tax
due on the transaction.

    (d

      ) (g) If a seller claims that certain sales are exempt and does not provide the certificate,
information, or proof required by paragraph (b), clause (2), within 120 days after the date of the
commissioner's request for substantiation, then the exemptions claimed by the seller that required
substantiation are disallowed.

    Sec. 9. [297I.11] AUTOMOBILE THEFT PREVENTION SURCHARGE.
    Subdivision 1. Surcharge. Each insurer engaged in the writing of policies of automobile
insurance shall collect a surcharge, at the rate of 50 cents per vehicle for every six months of
coverage, on each policy of automobile insurance providing comprehensive insurance coverage
issued or renewed in this state. The surcharge may not be considered premium for any purpose,
including the computation of premium tax or agents' commissions. The amount of the surcharge
must be separately stated on either a billing or policy declaration sent to an insured. Insurers shall
remit the revenue derived from this surcharge to the commissioner of revenue for purposes of the
automobile theft prevention program described in section 65B.84. For purposes of this subdivision,
"policy of automobile insurance" has the meaning given it in section 65B.14, covering only the
following types of vehicles as defined in section 168.002:
    (1) a passenger automobile;
    (2) a pickup truck;
    (3) a van but not commuter vans as defined in section 168.126; or
    (4) a motorcycle,
except that no vehicle with a gross vehicle weight in excess of 10,000 pounds is included within
this definition.
    Subd. 2. Automobile theft prevention account. A special revenue account in the state treasury
shall be credited with the proceeds of the surcharge imposed under subdivision 1. Of the revenue
in the account, $1,300,000 each year must be transferred to the general fund. Revenues in excess of
$1,300,000 each year may be used only for the automobile theft prevention program described in
section 65B.84.
    Subd. 3. Collection and administration. The commissioner shall collect and administer the
surcharge imposed by this section in the same manner as the taxes imposed by this chapter. The
commissioner is appropriated annually, from the automobile theft prevention special revenue
account, an amount to reimburse the Department of Revenue for the costs incurred in administering
and collecting the surcharge imposed under subdivision 1.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for premiums collected after June 30, 2012.

section shall apportion its net income on the basis of the percentage obtained by taking the sum of:
    (1) 75 percent of the percentage which the sales made within this state in connection with the
trade or business during the tax period are of the total sales wherever made in connection with the
trade or business during the tax period;
    (2) 12.5 percent of the percentage which the total tangible property used by the taxpayer in this
state in connection with the trade or business during the tax period is of the total tangible property,
wherever located, used by the taxpayer in connection with the trade or business during the tax period;
and
    (3) 12.5 percent of the percentage which the taxpayer's total payrolls paid or incurred in this state
or paid in respect to labor performed in this state in connection with the trade or business during

or action sent postage prepaid by United States mail to the taxpayer or other person affected by the
determination or action at the taxpayer's or person's last known address, is sufficient. If the taxpayer
or person being notified is deceased or is under a legal disability, or, in the case of a corporation
being notified that has terminated its existence, notice to the last known address of the taxpayer,
person, or corporation is sufficient, unless the department has been provided with a new address by
a party authorized to receive notices from the commissioner.
    (b) If a taxpayer or other person agrees to accept notification by electronic means, notice of a
determination or action of the commissioner sent by electronic mail to the taxpayer's or person's last

payable to the commissioner are required to be made by electronic means, and the payments are
remitted by some other means, there is a penalty in the amount of five percent of each payment that
should have been remitted electronically. After the commissioner's initial notification to the taxpayer
that payments are required to be made by electronic means, the commissioner is not required to
notify the taxpayer in subsequent periods if the initial notification specified the amount of tax liability
at which a taxpayer is required to remit payments by electronic means. The penalty can be abated
under the abatement procedures prescribed in section 270C.34 if the failure to remit the payment
electronically is due to reasonable cause. The penalty bears interest at the rate specified in section

   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 270C.69, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Notice and procedures. (a) The commissioner may, within five years after the
date of assessment of the tax, or if a lien has been filed under section 270C.63, within the statutory
period for enforcement of the lien, give notice to any employer deriving income which has a taxable
situs in this state regardless of whether the income is exempt from taxation, that an employee of that
employer is delinquent in a certain amount with respect to any taxes, including penalties, interest,
and costs. The commissioner can proceed under this section only if the tax is uncontested or if the
time for appeal of the tax has expired. The commissioner shall not proceed under this section until
the expiration of 30 days after mailing to the taxpayer, at the taxpayer's last known address, a written
notice of (1) the amount of taxes, interest, and penalties due from the taxpayer and demand for their
payment, and (2) the commissioner's intention to require additional withholding by the taxpayer's
employer pursuant to this section. The effect of the notice shall expire one year after it has been
mailed to the taxpayer provided that the notice may be renewed by mailing a new notice which is in
accordance with this section. The renewed notice shall have the effect of reinstating the priority of
the original claim. The notice to the taxpayer shall be in substantially the same form as that provided
in section 571.72. The notice shall further inform the taxpayer of the wage exemptions contained in
section 550.37, subdivision 14. If no statement of exemption is received by the commissioner within
30 days from the mailing of the notice, the commissioner may proceed under this section. The notice
to the taxpayer's employer may be served by mail or by delivery by an agent of the department and
shall be in substantially the same form as provided in section 571.75. Upon receipt of notice, the
employer shall withhold from compensation due or to become due to the employee, the total amount
shown by the notice, subject to the provisions of section 571.922. The employer shall continue to
withhold each pay period until the notice is released by the commissioner under section 270C.7109.
Upon receipt of notice by the employer, the claim of the state of Minnesota shall have priority over
any subsequent garnishments or wage assignments. The commissioner may arrange between the
employer and the employee for withholding a portion of the total amount due the employee each
pay period, until the total amount shown by the notice plus accrued interest has been withheld.
   (b) The "compensation due" any employee is defined in accordance with the provisions of section
571.921. The maximum withholding allowed under this section for any one pay period shall be
decreased by any amounts payable pursuant to a garnishment action with respect to which the
employer was served prior to being served with the notice of delinquency and any amounts covered
by any irrevocable and previously effective assignment of wages; the employer shall give notice to

the commissioner of the amounts and the facts relating to such assignments within ten days after
the service of the notice of delinquency on the form provided by the commissioner as noted in this
section.
    (c) Within ten days after the expiration of such pay period, the employer shall remit to the
commissioner, on a form and in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, the amount withheld
during each pay period under this section. The employer must file all wage levy disclosure
forms and remit all wage levy payments by electronic means. The requirement in this section to
use electronic means may be waived by the commissioner if the commissioner determines that
the requirement causes an undue hardship. The employer must request the waiver in the form
and manner prescribed by the commissioner before making their payment or submitting their
disclosure form by mail. In determining whether the electronic means requirement causes an undue
hardship the commissioner may consider unusual circumstances which may prevent the employer
from using electronic means and any other factor that the commissioner determines is pertinent.
"Unusual circumstances" includes not having access to a telephone or a computer, being physically
unable to use a telephone or a computer, or the telephone or computer system available to the
employer is incompatible with the department's system used for electronic filing or payments.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for wage levy disclosures or wage levy payments
filed or made after December 31, 2012.

$10,000); or
    (2) $10,000,000.
    (d) The term "understatement" means the excess of the amount of the tax required to be shown
on the return for the period, over the amount of the tax imposed that is shown on the return. The
excess must be determined without regard to items to which subdivision 27 applies. The amount of
the understatement shall be reduced by that part of the understatement that is attributable to the tax
treatment of any item by the taxpayer if (1) there is or was substantial authority for the treatment,
or (2)(i) any item with respect to which the relevant facts affecting the item's tax treatment are
adequately disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the return and (ii) there is a reasonable
basis for the tax treatment of the item. The exception for substantial authority under clause (1)
does not apply to positions listed by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 6662(d)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code. A corporation does not have a reasonable basis for its tax treatment of an
item attributable to a multiple-party financing transaction if the treatment does not clearly reflect
the income of the corporation within the meaning of section 6662(d)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue
Code. The special rules in cases involving tax shelters provided in section 6662(d)(2)(C) of the
Internal Revenue Code shall apply and shall apply to a tax shelter the principal purpose of which is
the avoidance or evasion of state taxes.
    (e) The commissioner may abate all or any part of the addition to the tax provided by this section
on a showing by the taxpayer that there was reasonable cause for the understatement, or part of it,
and that the taxpayer acted in good faith. The additional tax and penalty shall bear interest ­      a­

court shall, upon application, appoint a receiver of the property and business of the delinquent
defendant for the purpose of impounding the same as security for any judgment which has been

    (2) the owner resides in or the business is located in an area designated a labor surplus area by
the United States Department of Labor; or
   (3) the business is a certified rehabilitation facility or extended employment provider as
described in chapter 268A.

provided under this subdivision.
    (e) The Department of Revenue shall gather data necessary to make the determinations required
by paragraph (c), clause (1), and shall annually certify counties that qualify under paragraph (c),
clause (1). An area designated a labor surplus area retains that status for 120 days after certified

unemployment rates in the state;
    (2) businesses that are likely to expand and provide additional permanent employment in rural
areas of the state, or enhance the quality of existing jobs in those areas;
    (3) businesses located in border communities that experience a competitive disadvantage due to
location;
    (4) businesses that have been unable to obtain traditional financial assistance due to a

    (5) businesses that utilize state resources and reduce state dependence on outside resources, and
that produce products or services consistent with the long-term social and economic needs of the
state; and

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.13, subdivision 24, is amended to read:
    Subd. 24. Class 3. ­
                       (­
                        a­
                         ) Commercial and industrial property and utility real and personal property
is class 3a.
    (1) Except as otherwise provided, each parcel of commercial, industrial, or utility real property
has a class rate of 1.5 percent of the first tier of market value, and 2.0 percent of the remaining market
value. In the case of contiguous parcels of property owned by the same person or entity, only the
value equal to the first-tier value of the contiguous parcels qualifies for the reduced class rate, except
that contiguous parcels owned by the same person or entity shall be eligible for the first-tier value
class rate on each separate business operated by the owner of the property, provided the business
is housed in a separate structure. For the purposes of this subdivision, the first tier means the first
$150,000 of market value. Real property owned in fee by a utility for transmission line right-of-way
shall be classified at the class rate for the higher tier.
    For purposes of this subdivision, parcels are considered to be contiguous even if they are
separated from each other by a road, street, waterway, or other similar intervening type of property.
Connections between parcels that consist of power lines or pipelines do not cause the parcels to
be contiguous. Property owners who have contiguous parcels of property that constitute separate
businesses that may qualify for the first-tier class rate shall notify the assessor by July 1, for
treatment beginning in the following taxes payable year.
    (2) All personal property that is: (i) part of an electric generation, transmission, or distribution
system; or (ii) part of a pipeline system transporting or distributing water, gas, crude oil, or petroleum
products; and (iii) not described in clause (3), and all railroad operating property has a class rate as
provided under clause (1) for the first tier of market value and the remaining market value. In the
case of multiple parcels in one county that are owned by one person or entity, only one first tier
amount is eligible for the reduced rate.
    (3) The entire market value of personal property that is: (i) tools, implements, and machinery of
an electric generation, transmission, or distribution system; (ii) tools, implements, and machinery
of a pipeline system transporting or distributing water, gas, crude oil, or petroleum products; or (iii)
the mains and pipes used in the distribution of steam or hot or chilled water for heating or cooling
buildings, has a class rate as provided under clause (1) for the remaining market value in excess of
the first tier.

   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290.067, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Amount of credit. (a) A taxpayer may take as a credit against the tax due from
the taxpayer and a spouse, if any, under this chapter an amount equal to the dependent care credit
for which the taxpayer is eligible pursuant to the provisions of section 21 of the Internal Revenue
Code subject to the limitations provided in subdivision 2 except that in determining whether the
child qualified as a dependent, income received as a Minnesota family investment program grant or

allowance to or on behalf of the child must not be taken into account in determining whether the
child received more than half of the child's support from the taxpayer, and the provisions of section
32(b)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply.
    (b) If a child who has not attained the age of six years at the close of the taxable year is cared
for at a licensed family day care home operated by the child's parent, the taxpayer is deemed to
have paid employment-related expenses. If the child is 16 months old or younger at the close of the
taxable year, the amount of expenses deemed to have been paid equals the maximum limit for one
qualified individual under section 21(c) and (d) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the child is older
than 16 months of age but has not attained the age of six years at the close of the taxable year, the
amount of expenses deemed to have been paid equals the amount the licensee would charge for the
care of a child of the same age for the same number of hours of care.
   (c) If a married couple:
   (1) has a child who has not attained the age of one year at the close of the taxable year;
   (2) files a joint tax return for the taxable year; and
    (3) does not participate in a dependent care assistance program as defined in section 129 of the
Internal Revenue Code, in lieu of the actual employment related expenses paid for that child under
paragraph (a) or the deemed amount under paragraph (b), the lesser of (i) the combined earned
income of the couple or (ii) the amount of the maximum limit for one qualified individual under
section 21(c) and (d) of the Internal Revenue Code will be deemed to be the employment related
expense paid for that child. The earned income limitation of section 21(d) of the Internal Revenue
Code shall not apply to this deemed amount. These deemed amounts apply regardless of whether
any employment-related expenses have been paid.
    (d) If the taxpayer is not required and does not file a federal individual income tax return for the
tax year, no credit is allowed for any amount paid to any person unless:
    (1) the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person are included on the return
claiming the credit; or
    (2) if the person is an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code
and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the name and address of
the person are included on the return claiming the credit.
In the case of a failure to provide the information required under the preceding sentence, the
preceding sentence does not apply if it is shown that the taxpayer exercised due diligence in
attempting to provide the information required.
    In the case of a nonresident, part-year resident, or a person who has earned income not subject
to tax under this chapter including earned income excluded pursuant to section 290.01, subdivision
19b, clause (9) o

                       ), the credit determined under section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code must be
allocated based on the ratio by which the earned income of the claimant and the claimant's spouse
from Minnesota sources bears to the total earned income of the claimant and the claimant's spouse.
   For residents of Minnesota, the subtractions for military pay under section 290.01, subdivision
19b, clauses (10) and (11), are not considered "earned income not subject to tax under this chapter."

   For residents of Minnesota, the exclusion of combat pay under section 112 of the Internal
Revenue Code is not considered "earned income not subject to tax under this chapter."
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 290.0671, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Credit allowed. (a) An individual is allowed a credit against the tax imposed by
this chapter equal to a percentage of earned income. To receive a credit, a taxpayer must be eligible
for a credit under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code.
   (b) For individuals with no qualifying children, the credit equals 1.9125 percent of the first
$4,620 of earned income. The credit is reduced by 1.9125 percent of earned income or adjusted
gross income, whichever is greater, in excess of $5,770, but in no case is the credit less than zero.
    (c) For individuals with one qualifying child, the credit equals 8.5 percent of the first $6,920 of
earned income and 8.5 percent of earned income over $12,080 but less than $13,450. The credit is
reduced by 5.73 percent of earned income or adjusted gross income, whichever is greater, in excess
of $15,080, but in no case is the credit less than zero.
    (d) For individuals with two or more qualifying children, the credit equals ten percent of the first
$9,720 of earned income and 20 percent of earned income over $14,860 but less than $16,800. The
credit is reduced by 10.3 percent of earned income or adjusted gross income, whichever is greater,
in excess of $17,890, but in no case is the credit less than zero.
    (e) For a nonresident or part-year resident, the credit must be allocated based on the percentage
calculated under section 290.06, subdivision 2c, paragraph (e).
    (f) For a person who was a resident for the entire tax year and has earned income not subject
to tax under this chapter, including income excluded under section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clause
(9) o
    ­­
     r­(1
        ­5­­
           ), the credit must be allocated based on the ratio of federal adjusted gross income reduced
by the earned income not subject to tax under this chapter over federal adjusted gross income. For
purposes of this paragraph, the subtractions for military pay under section 290.01, subdivision 19b,
clauses (10) and (11), are not considered "earned income not subject to tax under this chapter."
   For the purposes of this paragraph, the exclusion of combat pay under section 112 of the Internal
Revenue Code is not considered "earned income not subject to tax under this chapter."
    (g) For tax years beginning after December 31, 2007, and before December 31, 2010, the $5,770
in paragraph (b), the $15,080 in paragraph (c), and the $17,890 in paragraph (d), after being adjusted
for inflation under subdivision 7, are each increased by $3,000 for married taxpayers filing joint
returns. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2008, the commissioner shall annually adjust
the $3,000 by the percentage determined pursuant to the provisions of section 1(f) of the Internal
Revenue Code, except that in section 1(f)(3)(B), the word "2007" shall be substituted for the word
"1992." For 2009, the commissioner shall then determine the percent change from the 12 months
ending on August 31, 2007, to the 12 months ending on August 31, 2008, and in each subsequent
year, from the 12 months ending on August 31, 2007, to the 12 months ending on August 31 of
the year preceding the taxable year. The earned income thresholds as adjusted for inflation must be
rounded to the nearest $10. If the amount ends in $5, the amount is rounded up to the nearest $10.
The determination of the commissioner under this subdivision is not a rule under the Administrative
Procedure Act.

     (h) For tax years beginning after December 31, 2010, and before January 1, 2012, the $5,770
in paragraph (b), the $15,080 in paragraph (c), and the $17,890 in paragraph (d), after being
adjusted for inflation under subdivision 7, are each increased by $5,000 for married taxpayers
filing joint returns. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2010, and before January 1, 2012,
the commissioner shall annually adjust the $5,000 by the percentage determined pursuant to the
provisions of section 1(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, except that in section 1(f)(3)(B), the word
"2008" shall be substituted for the word "1992." For 2011, the commissioner shall then determine
the percent change from the 12 months ending on August 31, 2008, to the 12 months ending
on August 31, 2010. The earned income thresholds as adjusted for inflation must be rounded
to the nearest $10. If the amount ends in $5, the amount is rounded up to the nearest $10. The
determination of the commissioner under this subdivision is not a rule under the Administrative
Procedure Act.
    (i) The commissioner shall construct tables showing the amount of the credit at various income
levels and make them available to taxpayers. The tables shall follow the schedule contained in this
subdivision, except that the commissioner may graduate the transition between income brackets.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 290.091, subdivision 2, is amended to

     ) in the case of any building in which at least 75 percent of the usable square footage constitutes
a housing development project if:
   (i) the project is financed with the proceeds of bonds issued under section 469.034 or from
nongovernmental sources;
    (ii) the project is either located on land that is owned or is being acquired by the authority only
for development purposes, or is not owned by the authority at the time the contract is entered into
but the contract provides for conveyance or lease to the authority of the project or improvements
upon completion of construction; and
   (iii) the authority finds and determines that elimination of the public bidding requirements is
necessary in order for the housing development project to be economical and feasible.
     (b) An authority need not require a performance bond for the following projects:
     (1) a contract described in paragraph (a), clause (1);
   (2) a construction change order for a housing project in which 30 percent of the construction has
been completed;
   (3) a construction contract for a single-family housing project in which the authority acts as the
general construction contractor; or
     (4) a services or materials contract for a housing project.
   For purposes of this paragraph, "services or materials contract" does not include construction
contracts.

      Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.171, subdivision 11, is amended to read:
    Subd. 11. Limitations; last eight months of duration. This subdivision applies only to state
tax reductions first authorized by the municipality to be provided to a business within eight months
of the expiration of the border city enterprise zone's designation.
    Before agreeing with a business to provide tax reductions, the municipality must submit the
proposed tax reductions to the commissioner for approval. The commissioner shall review and
analyze the proposal in light of, at least: (1) the proposed investment that the business will make
in the zone, (2) the number and quality of new jobs that will be created in the zone, (3) the overall
positive impact on economic activity in the zone, and (4) the extent to which the impacts in clauses
(1) to (3) are dependent upon providing the state tax reductions to the business. The commissioner
shall disapprove the proposal if the commissioner determines the public benefits of increased
investment and employment resulting from the tax reductions is disproportionately small relative
to the cost of the state tax reductions. If the commissioner disapproves of the proposal, the tax
reductions are not allowed to the business.
   If the municipality submits the proposal to the commissioner before expiration of the zone
designation, the authority to grant the tax reductions continues until the commissioner acts on the
proposal.

    Subd. 6. Pooling permitted for deficits. (a) This subdivision applies only to districts for which
the request for certification was made before August 1, 2001, and without regard to whether the
request for certification was made prior to August 1, 1979.
    (b) The municipality for the district may transfer available increments from another tax
increment financing district located in the municipality, if the transfer is necessary to eliminate
a deficit in the district to which the increments are transferred. The municipality may transfer
increments as provided by this subdivision without regard to whether the transfer or expenditure is
authorized by the tax increment financing plan for the district from which the transfer is made. A
deficit in the district for purposes of this subdivision means the lesser of the following two amounts:
   (1)(i) the amount due during the calendar year to pay preexisting obligations of the district;
minus
    (ii) the total increments collected or to be collected from properties located within the district
that are available for the calendar year including amounts collected in prior years that are currently
available; plus
      (iii) total increments from properties located in other districts in the municipality including
amounts collected in prior years that are available to be used to meet the district's obligations under
this section, excluding this subdivision, or other provisions of law ­              (b

year as a result of the changes in class rates in Laws 1997, chapter 231, article 1; Laws 1998, chapter
389, article 2; and Laws 1999, chapter 243, and Laws 2001, First Special Session chapter 5, or the
elimination of the general education tax levy under Laws 2001, First Special Session chapter 5.
   The authority may compute the deficit amount under clause (1) only (without regard to the limit
under clause (2)) if the authority makes an irrevocable commitment, by resolution, to use increments
from the district to which increments are to be transferred and any transferred increments are only
used to pay preexisting obligations and administrative expenses for the district that are required to
be paid under section 469.176, subdivision 4h, paragraph (a).
    (c) A preexisting obligation means:
    (1) bonds issued and sold before August 1, 2001, or bonds issued pursuant to a binding contract
requiring the issuance of bonds entered into before July 1, 2001, and bonds issued to refund such
bonds or to reimburse expenditures made in conjunction with a signed contractual agreement entered
into before August 1, 2001, to the extent that the bonds are secured by a pledge of increments from
the tax increment financing district; and
   (2) binding contracts entered into before August 1, 2001, to the extent that the contracts require
payments secured by a pledge of increments from the tax increment financing district.

    (d) The municipality may require a development authority, other than a seaway port authority, to
transfer available increments including amounts collected in prior years that are currently available
for any of its tax increment financing districts in the municipality to make up an insufficiency
in another district in the municipality, regardless of whether the district was established by the
development authority or another development authority. This authority applies notwithstanding
any law to the contrary, but applies only to a development authority that:
    (1) was established by the municipality; or
    (2) the governing body of which is appointed, in whole or part, by the municipality or an
officer of the municipality or which consists, in whole or part, of members of the governing body
of the municipality. The municipality may use this authority only after it has first used all available
increments of the receiving development authority to eliminate the insufficiency and exercised any
permitted action under section 469.1792, subdivision 3, for preexisting districts of the receiving
development authority to eliminate the insufficiency.
   (e) The authority under this subdivision to spend tax increments outside of the area of the district
from which the tax increments were collected:
    (1) is an exception to the restrictions under section 469.176, subdivisions 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e, 4i,
and 4j; the expenditure limits under section 469.176, subdivision 1c; and the other provisions of
this section; and the percentage restrictions under subdivision 2 must be calculated after deducting
increments spent under this subdivision from the total increments for the district; and
    (2) applies notwithstanding the provisions of the Tax Increment Financing Act in effect for
districts for which the request for certification was made before June 30, 1982, or any other law
to the contrary.
    (f) If a preexisting obligation requires the development authority to pay an amount that is limited
to the increment from the district or a specific development within the district and if the obligation
requires paying a higher amount to the extent that increments are available, the municipality may
determine that the amount due under the preexisting obligation equals the higher amount and may
authorize the transfer of increments under this subdivision to pay up to the higher amount. The
existence of a guarantee of obligations by the individual or entity that would receive the payment
under this paragraph is disregarded in the determination of eligibility to pool under this subdivision.
The authority to transfer increments under this paragraph may only be used to the extent that the
payment of all other preexisting obligations in the municipality due during the calendar year have
been satisfied.
    (g) For transfers of increments made in calendar year 2005 and later, the reduction in increments
as a result of the elimination of the general education tax levy for purposes of paragraph (b), clause
(2), for a taxes payable year equals the general education tax rate for the school district under
Minnesota Statutes 2000, section 273.1382, subdivision 1, for taxes payable in 2001, multiplied
by the captured tax capacity of the district for the current taxes payable year.
    Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.1764, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Scope; application. (a) This section applies to a tax increment financing district
or area added to a district, if the request for certification of the district or the area added to the district
was made after July 31, 1979, and before July 1, 1982.

    (c) This section does not apply to increments from a district that is subject to the provisions of
this section, if:
    (1) the district was decertified before the enactment of this section and all increments spent on
activities located outside of the geographic area of the district were repaid and distributed as excess
increments under section 469.176, subdivision 2; or
   (2) the use of increments on activities located outside of the geographic area of the district
consists solely of payment of debt service on bonds under section 469.129, subdivision 2, before its
repeal, and any bonds issued to refund bonds issued under that subdivision.
   Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.177, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Original net tax capacity. (a) Upon or after adoption of a tax increment financing
plan, the auditor of any county in which the district is situated shall, upon request of the authority,
certify the original net tax capacity of the tax increment financing district and that portion of the
district overlying any subdistrict as described in the tax increment financing plan and shall certify in
each year thereafter the amount by which the original net tax capacity has increased or decreased as
a result of a change in tax exempt status of property within the district and any subdistrict, reduction
or enlargement of the district or changes pursuant to subdivision 4. The auditor shall certify the
amount within 30 days after receipt of the request and sufficient information to identify the parcels
included in the district. The certification relates to the taxes payable year as provided in subdivision
6.
    (b) If the classification under section 273.13 of property located in a district changes to a
classification that has a different assessment ratio, the original net tax capacity of that property
must be redetermined at the time when its use is changed as if the property had originally been
classified in the same class in which it is classified after its use is changed.
    (c) The amount to be added to the original net tax capacity of the district as a result of previously
tax exempt real property within the district becoming taxable equals the net tax capacity of the
real property as most recently assessed pursuant to section 273.18 or, if that assessment was made
more than one year prior to the date of title transfer rendering the property taxable, the net tax
capacity assessed by the assessor at the time of the transfer. If improvements are made to tax exempt
property after the municipality approves the district and before the parcel becomes taxable, the
assessor shall, at the request of the authority, separately assess the estimated market value of the
improvements. If the property becomes taxable, the county auditor shall add to original net tax
capacity, the net tax capacity of the parcel, excluding the separately assessed improvements. If
substantial taxable improvements were made to a parcel after certification of the district and if the
property later becomes tax exempt, in whole or part, as a result of the authority acquiring the property
through foreclosure or exercise of remedies under a lease or other revenue agreement or as a result
of tax forfeiture, the amount to be added to the original net tax capacity of the district as a result
of the property again becoming taxable is the amount of the parcel's value that was included in
original net tax capacity when the parcel was first certified. The amount to be added to the original
net tax capacity of the district as a result of enlargements equals the net tax capacity of the added real
property as most recently certified by the commissioner of revenue as of the date of modification of
100TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, APRIL 4, 2012                                            5727

the tax increment financing plan pursuant to section 469.175, subdivision 4.
     (d) If the net tax capacity of a property increases because the property no longer qualifies under
the Minnesota Agricultural Property Tax Law, section 273.111; the Minnesota Open Space Property
Tax Law, section 273.112; or the Metropolitan Agricultural Preserves Act, chapter 473H, the Rural
Preserve Property Tax Program under section 273.114, or because platted, unimproved property is
improved or market value is increased after approval of the plat under section 273.11, subdivision
­4
1 ­­
   , 14a,­ or 14b, the increase in net tax capacity must be added to the original net tax capacity. If the
net tax capacity of a property increases because the property no longer qualifies for the homestead
market value exclusion under section 273.13, subdivision 35, the increase in net tax capacity must
be added to original net tax capacity if the original construction of the affected home was completed
before the date the assessor certified the original net tax capacity of the district.
    (e) The amount to be subtracted from the original net tax capacity of the district as a result of
previously taxable real property within the district becoming tax exempt or qualifying in whole or
part for an exclusion from taxable market value, or a reduction in the geographic area of the district,
shall be the amount of original net tax capacity initially attributed to the property becoming tax
exempt, being excluded from taxable market value, or being removed from the district. If the net
tax capacity of property located within the tax increment financing district is reduced by reason
of a court-ordered abatement, stipulation agreement, voluntary abatement made by the assessor or
auditor or by order of the commissioner of revenue, the reduction shall be applied to the original
net tax capacity of the district when the property upon which the abatement is made has not been
improved since the date of certification of the district and to the captured net tax capacity of the
district in each year thereafter when the abatement relates to improvements made after the date
of certification. The county auditor may specify reasonable form and content of the request for
certification of the authority and any modification thereof pursuant to section 469.175, subdivision
4.
    (f) If a parcel of property contained a substandard building or improvements described in section
469.174, subdivision 10, paragraph (e), that were demolished or removed and if the authority elects
to treat the parcel as occupied by a substandard building under section 469.174, subdivision 10,
paragraph (b), or by improvements under section 469.174, subdivision 10, paragraph (e), the auditor
shall certify the original net tax capacity of the parcel using the greater of (1) the current net tax
capacity of the parcel, or (2) the estimated market value of the parcel for the year in which the
building or other improvements were demolished or removed, but applying the class rates for the
current year.
    (g) For a redevelopment district qualifying under section 469.174, subdivision 10, paragraph (a),
clause (4), as a qualified disaster area, the auditor shall certify the value of the land as the original
tax capacity for any parcel in the district that contains a building that suffered substantial damage
as a result of the disaster or emergency.
    Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.1793, is amended to read:
    469.1793 DEVELOPER OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED.
    If a developer or other private entity agreed to make payments to the authority or municipality
to reimburse the municipality for the state aid offset under Minnesota Statutes 2000, section
273.1399, the obligation continues in effect, notwithstanding the repeal of section 273.1399.

days before the date of the hearing.
    (c) A county may issue the bonds only upon obtaining the approval of a majority of the voters
voting on the question of issuing the obligations, if a petition requesting a vote on the issuance is

    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 373.40, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Limitations on amount. A county may not issue bonds under this section if the
maximum amount of principal and interest to become due in any year on all the outstanding bonds
issued pursuant to this section (including the bonds to be issued) will equal or exceed 0.12 percent
of taxable market value of property in the county. Calculation of the limit must be made using
the taxable market value for the taxes payable year in which the obligations are issued and sold,
provided that, for purposes of determining the principal and interest due in any year, the county
may deduct the amount of interest expected to be paid or reimbursed to the county by the federal
government in that year on any outstanding bonds or the bonds to be issued. This section does not
limit the authority to issue bonds under any other special or general law.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 474A.02, subdivision 23a, is amended to read:

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
any bonding authority allocated in 2011 and subsequent years.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 474A.091, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. Mortgage bonds. (a) Bonding authority remaining in the unified pool on October
1 is available for single-family housing programs for cities that applied in January and received
an allocation under section 474A.061, subdivision 2a, in the same calendar year. The Minnesota
Housing Finance Agency shall receive an allocation for mortgage bonds pursuant to this section,
minus any amounts for a city or consortium that intends to issue bonds on its own behalf under
paragraph (c).
    (b) The agency may issue bonds on behalf of participating cities. The agency shall request an
allocation from the commissioner for all applicants who choose to have the agency issue bonds on
their behalf and the commissioner shall allocate the requested amount to the agency. Allocations
shall be awarded by the commissioner each Monday commencing on the first Monday in October
through the last Monday in November for applications received by 4:30 p.m. on the Monday of the
week preceding an allocation.
    For cities who choose to have the agency issue bonds on their behalf, allocations will be made
loan by loan, on a first-come, first-served basis among the cities. The agency shall submit an
application fee pursuant to section 474A.03, subdivision 4, and an application deposit equal to two
percent of the requested allocation to the commissioner when requesting an allocation from the
unified pool. After awarding an allocation and receiving a notice of issuance for mortgage bonds
issued on behalf of the participating cities, the commissioner shall transfer the application deposit
to the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency.
    For purposes of paragraphs (a) to (d), "city" means a county or a consortium of local government
units that agree through a joint powers agreement to apply together for single-family housing
programs, and has the meaning given it in section 462C.02, subdivision 6. "Agency" means the
Minnesota Housing Finance Agency.
     (c) Any city that received an allocation pursuant to section 474A.061, subdivision 2a, paragraph
(f), in the current year that wishes to receive an additional allocation from the unified pool and issue
bonds on its own behalf or pursuant to a joint powers agreement shall notify the Minnesota Housing
Finance Agency by the third Monday in September. The total amount of allocation for mortgage
bonds for a city choosing to issue bonds on its own behalf or through a joint powers agreement is
limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount requested, or (ii) the product of the total amount available
for mortgage bonds from the unified pool, multiplied by the ratio of the population of each city that
applied in January and received an allocation under section 474A.061, subdivision 2a, in the same
calendar year, as determined by the most recent estimate of the city's population released by the
state demographer's office to the total of the population of all the cities that applied in January and
received an allocation under section 474A.061, subdivision 2a, in the same calendar year. If a city
choosing to issue bonds on its own behalf or through a joint powers agreement is located within a

county that has also chosen to issue bonds on its own behalf or through a joint powers agreement,
the city's population will be deducted from the county's population in calculating the amount of
allocations under this paragraph.
    The Minnesota Housing Finance Agency shall notify each city choosing to issue bonds on its
own behalf or pursuant to a joint powers agreement of the amount of its allocation by October 15.
Upon determining the amount of the allocation of each choosing to issue bonds on its own behalf
or through a joint powers agreement, the agency shall forward a list specifying the amounts allotted
to each city.
    A city that chooses to issue bonds on its own behalf or through a joint powers agreement may
request an allocation from the commissioner by forwarding an application with an application fee
pursuant to section 474A.03, subdivision 4, and an application deposit equal to two percent of the
requested amount to the commissioner no later than 4:30 p.m. on the Monday of the week preceding
an allocation. Allocations to cities that choose to issue bonds on their own behalf shall be awarded
by the commissioner on the first Monday after October 15 through the last Monday in November.
No city may receive an allocation from the commissioner after the last Monday in November. The
commissioner shall allocate the requested amount to the city or cities subject to the limitations under
this subdivision.
    If a city issues mortgage bonds from an allocation received under this paragraph, the issuer must
provide for the recycling of funds into new loans. If the issuer is not able to provide for recycling,
the issuer must notify the commissioner in writing of the reason that recycling was not possible and
the reason the issuer elected not to have the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency issue the bonds.
"Recycling" means the use of money generated from the repayment and prepayment of loans for
further eligible loans or for the redemption of bonds and the issuance of current refunding bonds.
   (d) No entitlement city or county or city in an entitlement county may apply for or be allocated
authority to issue mortgage bonds or use mortgage credit certificates from the unified pool.
     (e) An allocation awarded to the agency for mortgage bonds under this section may be carried
forward by the agency ­n   i­­o

a notice of its intention to issue the bonds and the date and time of the hearing to obtain public
comment on the matter. The notice must be published in the official newspaper of the municipality

or in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality. Additionally, the notice may be posted
on the official Web site, if any, of the municipality. The notice must be published at least 14 but not
more than 28 days before the date of the hearing.
     (c) A municipality may issue the bonds only after obtaining the approval of a majority of the
voters voting on the question of issuing the obligations, if a petition requesting a vote on the issuance
is signed by voters equal to five percent of the votes cast in the municipality in the last municipal
general election and is filed with the clerk within 30 days after the public hearing. T   ­h e­

issued under this section, including the bonds to be issued, will equal or exceed 0.16 percent of the
taxable market value of property in the municipality. Calculation of the limit must be made using
the taxable market value for the taxes payable year in which the obligations are issued and sold,
provided that, for purposes of determining the principal and interest due in any year, the municipality
may deduct the amount of interest expected to be paid or reimbursed to the municipality by the
federal government in that year on any outstanding bonds or the bonds to be issued. In the case of a
municipality with a population of 2,500 or more, the bonds are subject to the net debt limits under
section 475.53. In the case of a shared facility in which more than one municipality participates,
upon compliance by each participating municipality with the requirements of subdivision 2, the
limitations in this subdivision and the net debt represented by the bonds shall be allocated to each
participating municipality in proportion to its required financial contribution to the financing of the

approved by a vote of all of the members of the governing body present at the meeting following a
public hearing for which notice has been published in the official newspaper at least ten days but
not more than 28 days prior to the hearing; and
    (2) if a petition requesting a vote on the issuance is signed by voters equal to five percent of the
votes cast in the last municipal general election and is filed with the municipal clerk within 30 days
of the public hearing, the municipality may issue the bonds only after obtaining the approval of a
majority of the voters voting on the question of the issuance of the obligations. If the municipality
elects not to submit the question to the voters, the municipality shall not propose the issuance of

contact information where additional information may be obtained for each special taxing district.
The taxing authorities must provide the county auditor with the information to be included in the

they have questions related to the notice and an address where comments will be received by mail,
except that no notice required under this section shall be interpreted as requiring the printing of a
personal telephone number or address as the contact information for a taxing authority. If a taxing
authority does not maintain public offices where telephone calls can be received by the authority,
the authority may inform the county of the lack of a public telephone number and the county shall
not list a telephone number for that taxing authority.
    (d) The notice must state for each parcel:
    (1) the market value of the property as determined under section 273.11, and used for computing
property taxes payable in the following year and for taxes payable in the current year as each appears

stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed
amount that a referendum is pending and that, if approved by the voters, the tax amount may be
higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, the levy for Minneapolis
Park and Recreation shall be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the
case of the city of St. Paul, the levy for the St. Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from
the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under
section 134.07 may be listed separately from the remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case
of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F
applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity
subject to the areawide tax must each be stated separately and not included in the sum of the special
taxing districts; and
   (3) the increase or decrease between the total taxes payable in the current year and the total
proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.
    For purposes of this section, the amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior
citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before
subtraction of the deferred property tax amount.
   (e) The notice must clearly state that the proposed or final taxes do not include the following:
   (1) special assessments;
    (2) levies approved by the voters after the date the proposed taxes are certified, including bond
referenda and school district levy referenda;
  (3) a levy limit increase approved by the voters by the first Tuesday after the first Monday in
November of the levy year as provided under section 275.73;
    (4) amounts necessary to pay cleanup or other costs due to a natural disaster occurring after the
date the proposed taxes are certified;

    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 7, failure of the county auditor to prepare or the county
treasurer to deliver the notice as required in this section does not invalidate the proposed or final tax
levy or the taxes payable pursuant to the tax levy.
    (g) If the notice the taxpayer receives under this section lists the property as nonhomestead,
and satisfactory documentation is provided to the county assessor by the applicable deadline, and
the property qualifies for the homestead classification in that assessment year, the assessor shall
reclassify the property to homestead for taxes payable in the following year.
   (h) In the case of class 4 residential property used as a residence for lease or rental periods of 30
days or more, the taxpayer must either:
    (1) mail or deliver a copy of the notice of proposed property taxes to each tenant, renter, or
lessee; or
   (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
    The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of
receipt of the notice, whichever is later. A taxpayer may notify the county treasurer of the address
of the taxpayer, agent, caretaker, or manager of the premises to which the notice must be mailed in

any levies made by the regional rail authorities in the county of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin,
Ramsey, Scott, or Washington under chapter 398A shall be listed on a separate line directly under
the appropriate county's levy and (2) any levy by a special taxing district that exceeds 25 percent
of the total of all special taxing district levies on a tax statement must be separately stated. If the
county levy under this paragraph includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount. In the case of Ramsey County, if the county levy
under this paragraph includes an amount for public library service under section 134.07, the amount
attributable for that purpose may be separated from the remaining county levy amount. The amount
of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior citizens' property tax deferral program under
chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before subtraction of the deferred property tax
amount. The amount of the tax on contamination value imposed under sections 270.91 to 270.98, if
any, must also be separately stated. The dollar amounts, including the dollar amount of any special
assessments, may be rounded to the nearest even whole dollar. For purposes of this section whole
odd-numbered dollars may be adjusted to the next higher even-numbered dollar. The amount of
market value excluded under section 273.11, subdivision 16, if any, must also be listed on the tax
statement.
   (b) The property tax statements for manufactured homes and sectional structures taxed as
personal property shall contain the same information that is required on the tax statements for real
property.
   (c) Real and personal property tax statements must contain the following information in the order
given in this paragraph. The information must contain the current year tax information in the right
column with the corresponding information for the previous year in a column on the left:
   (1) the property's estimated market value under section 273.11, subdivision 1;
   (2) the property's homestead market value exclusion under section 273.13, subdivision 35;

   (3) the property's taxable market value after reductions under sections 273.11, subdivisions 1a
and 16, and 273.13, subdivision 35;
   (4) the property's gross tax, before credits;
   (5) for homestead agricultural properties, the credit under section 273.1384;
    (6) any credits received under sections 273.119; 273.1234 or 273.1235; 273.135; 273.1391;
273.1398, subdivision 4; 469.171; and 473H.10, except that the amount of credit received under
section 273.135 must be separately stated and identified as "taconite tax relief"; and
   (7) the net tax payable in the manner required in paragraph (a).
    (d) If the county uses envelopes for mailing property tax statements and if the county agrees, a
taxing district may include a notice with the property tax statement notifying taxpayers when the
taxing district will begin its budget deliberations for the current year, and encouraging taxpayers
to attend the hearings. If the county allows notices to be included in the envelope containing the
property tax statement, and if more than one taxing district relative to a given property decides to
include a notice with the tax statement, the county treasurer or auditor must coordinate the process
and may combine the information on a single announcement.

2013 and thereafter.
