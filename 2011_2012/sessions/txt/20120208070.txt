    (d) For purposes of registration identification, for vehicles registered in the "O" category, the
owner must declare at the time of registration whether the vehicle will carry a weight of 55,000
pounds or more and therefore be subject to the federal heavy vehicle use tax. For those owners who
declare a weight less than 55,000 pounds, a distinctive weight sticker must be issued and the owner
is restricted to a gross vehicle weight of less than 55,000 pounds.
    (e) Truck-tractors except those herein defined as farm and commercial zone vehicles shall be

    (g) The license plates issued for commercial zone vehicles shall be plainly marked. A person
operating a commercial zone vehicle outside the zone or area in which its operation is authorized
is guilty of a misdemeanor and, in addition to the misdemeanor penalty, the registrar shall revoke
the registration of the vehicle as a commercial zone vehicle and shall require that the vehicle be
registered at 100 percent of the full annual tax prescribed in the Minnesota base rate schedule, and
no part of this tax may be refunded during the balance of the registration year.

during each of the first eight years of vehicle life is 75 percent of the Minnesota base rate schedule.
During the ninth and succeeding years of vehicle life the tax is 50 percent of the Minnesota base
rate schedule.
    (i) On trucks, truck-tractors and semitrailer combinations, except those defined as farm trucks
and farm combinations, and except for those commercial zone vehicles specifically provided for
in this subdivision, the tax for each of the first eight years of vehicle life is 100 percent of the tax
imposed in the Minnesota base rate schedule, and during the ninth and succeeding years of vehicle
life, the tax is 75 percent of the Minnesota base rate prescribed by this subdivision.
    (j) For the purpose of registration, trailers coupled with a truck-tractor, semitrailer combination
are semitrailers.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2012, and applies to all registrations that
are effective on and after that date and special permits issued on and after that date.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 168.013, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3. Application; cancellation; excessive gross weight forbidden. (a) The applicant for
all licenses based on gross weight shall state the unloaded weight of the motor vehicle, trailer, or
semitrailer and the maximum load the applicant proposes to carry on it, the sum of which constitutes
the gross weight upon which the license tax must be paid. However, the declared gross weight upon
which the tax is paid must not be less than 1-1/4 times the declared unloaded weight of the motor
vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer to be registered, except recreational vehicles taxed under subdivision
1g, school buses taxed under subdivision 18, and tow trucks or towing vehicles defined in section
169.011, subdivision 83. The gross weight of a tow truck or towing vehicle is the actual weight of
the tow truck or towing vehicle fully equipped, but does not include the weight of a wrecked or
disabled vehicle towed or drawn by the tow truck or towing vehicle.
    (b) Except as provided by special permit issued under section 169.86, the gross weight of a
motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer must not exceed the gross weight upon which the license tax
has been paid by more than four percent or 1,000 pounds, whichever is greater; provided that, a
vehicle transporting unfinished forest products on a highway, other than a highway that is part of
the system of interstate and defense highways, unless a federal exemption is granted, in accordance
with paragraph (d)(3):
    (1) shall not exceed its gross vehicle weight upon which the license tax has been paid, or gross
axle weight on any axle, by more than five percent and, notwithstanding other law to the contrary,
is not subject to any fee, fine, or other assessment or penalty for exceeding a gross vehicle or axle
weight by up to five percent; and
    (2) between the dates set by the commissioner in accordance with section 169.826, subdivision
1, is not subject to any provision of paragraph (d) or chapter 169 limiting the gross axle weight of
any individual axle unless the entire vehicle also exceeds its gross vehicle weight plus its weight
allowance allowed in clause (1) and plus any weight allowance permitted under section 169.826, in
which case the vehicle is subject to all applicable penalties for excess weight violations.
   (c) The gross weight of the motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer for which the license tax is
paid must be indicated by a distinctive character on the license plate or plates except as provided in
3732                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [70TH DAY

subdivision 12 or section 169.86, subdivision 5a, as applicable, and the plate or plates must be kept
clean and clearly visible at all times.
    (d) The owner, driver, or user of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer, upon conviction
for transporting a gross weight in excess of the gross weight for which it was registered or for
operating a vehicle with an axle weight exceeding the maximum lawful axle load weight, is guilty
of a misdemeanor and subject to increased registration or reregistration according to the following
schedule:
    (1) Upon conviction for transporting a gross weight in excess of the gross weight for which a
motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer is registered by more than the allowance set forth in paragraph
(b) but less than 25 percent, or for operating or using a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer with an
axle weight exceeding the maximum lawful axle load as provided in sections 169.822 to 169.829
by more than the allowance set forth in paragraph (b) but less than 25 percent, the owner, driver,
or user of the motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer used to commit the violation, in addition to any
penalty imposed for the misdemeanor, shall apply to the registrar to increase the authorized gross
weight to be carried on the vehicle to a weight equal to or greater than the gross weight the owner,
driver, or user was convicted of carrying. The increase is computed for the balance of the calendar
year on the basis of 1/12 of the annual tax for each month remaining in the calendar year beginning
with the first day of the month in which the violation occurred. If the additional registration tax
computed upon that weight, plus the tax already paid, amounts to more than the regular tax for the
maximum gross weight permitted for the vehicle under sections 169.822 to 169.829, that additional
amount must nevertheless be paid into the highway fund, but the additional tax thus paid does not
authorize or permit any person to operate the vehicle with a gross weight in excess of the maximum
legal weight as provided by sections 169.822 to 169.829. Unless the owner within 30 days after
a conviction applies to increase the authorized weight and pays the additional tax as provided in
this section, the registrar shall revoke the registration on the vehicle and demand the return of the
registration card and plates issued on that registration.
    (2) Upon conviction of an owner, driver, or user of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer for
transporting a gross weight in excess of the gross weight for which the motor vehicle, trailer, or
semitrailer was registered by 25 percent or more or for operating or using the vehicle or trailer
with an axle weight exceeding the maximum lawful axle load as provided in sections 169.822 to
169.829 by 25 percent or more, and in addition to any penalty imposed for the misdemeanor, the
registrar shall either (i) cancel the reciprocity privileges on the vehicle involved if the vehicle is
being operated under reciprocity or (ii) if the vehicle is not being operated under reciprocity, cancel
the certificate of registration on the vehicle operated and demand the return of the registration
certificate and registration plates. The registrar may not cancel the registration or reciprocity
privileges for any vehicle found in violation of seasonal load restrictions imposed under section
169.87 unless the axle weight exceeds the year-round weight limit for the highway on which the
violation occurred. The registrar may investigate any allegation of gross weight violations and
demand that the operator show cause why all future operating privileges in the state should not be
revoked unless the additional tax assessed is paid.
    (3) Clause (1) does not apply to the first haul of unprocessed or raw farm products or unfinished
forest products, when the registered gross weight is not exceeded by more than ten percent. For
purposes of this clause, "first haul" means (i) the first, continuous transportation of unprocessed or

transportation of unfinished forest products from the place of production to the place of final
processing or manufacture located within 200 miles of the place of production.
    (4) When the registration on a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer is revoked by the registrar
according to this section, the vehicle must not be operated on the highways of the state until it is
registered or reregistered, as the case may be, and new plates issued, and the registration fee is the
annual tax for the total gross weight of the vehicle at the time of violation. The reregistration pursuant
to this subdivision of any vehicle operating under reciprocity agreements pursuant to section 168.181
or 168.187 must be at the full annual registration fee without regard to the percentage of vehicle
miles traveled in this state.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2012, and applies to all registrations that
are effective on and after that date and special permits issued on and after that date.
    Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 168.013, subdivision 12, is amended to read:
    Subd. 12. Additional tax for excessive gross weight. (a) Whenever an owner has registered a
vehicle and paid the tax as provided in subdivisions 1 to 1g, on the basis of a selected gross weight
of the vehicle and thereafter such owner desires to operate such vehicle with a greater gross weight
than that for which the tax has been paid, such owner shall be permitted to reregister such vehicle by
paying the additional tax due thereon for the remainder of the calendar year for which such vehicle
has been reregistered, the additional tax computed pro rata by the month, 1/12 of the annual tax
due for each month of the year remaining in the calendar year, beginning with the first day of the
month in which such owner desires to operate the vehicle with the greater weight. In computing
the additional tax as aforesaid, the owner shall be given credit for the unused portion of the tax
previously paid computed pro rata by the month, 1/12 of the annual tax paid for each month of the
year remaining in the calendar year beginning with the first day of the month in which such owner
desires to operate the vehicle with the greater weight. An owner will be permitted one reduction of
gross weight or change of registration per year, which will result in a refund. This refund will be
prorated monthly beginning with the first day of the month after such owner applies to amend the
registration. The application for amendment shall be accompanied by a fee of $3, and all fees shall
be deposited in the highway user tax distribution fund. Provided, however, the owner of a vehicle
may reregister the vehicle for a weight of more than 81,000 pounds for one or more 30-day periods.
For each 30-day period, the additional tax shall be equal to 1/12 of the difference between the annual
tax for the weight at which the vehicle is registered and reregistered. W                 ­h­­

or on-track equipment while being operated upon rails.
   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.06, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Traffic-control signal. (a) Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals
exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in
combination, only the colors Green, Red, and Yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian
signals carrying a word or legend. The traffic-control signal lights or colored lighted arrows
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
   (1) Green indication:
     (i) Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or
left unless a sign ­

                                e prohibits either turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning
right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time this signal is exhibited. Vehicular traffic turning left
or making a U-turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard.
    (ii) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow,
or other movement as permitted by other indications shown at the same time. S ­u­­
                                                                                 ch
                                                                                  ­ Vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic
lawfully using the intersection.
    (iii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in subdivision 6,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed
across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. Every driver of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to such pedestrian, except that the pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the green signal indication is first shown.
   (2) Steady yellow indication:
    (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that
the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic must not enter the intersection, except for the continued movement
allowed by any green arrow indication simultaneously exhibited.
    (ii) Pedestrians facing a circular yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control
signal as provided in subdivision 6, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the
roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.
   (3) Steady red indication:

    (i) Vehicular traffic facing a circular red signal alone must stop at a clearly marked stop line
but, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then
before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown, except
as follows: (A) the driver of a vehicle stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection in obedience
to a red or stop signal, and with the intention of making a right turn may make the right turn, after
stopping, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting such movement, but shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by the signal at that
intersection; or (B) the driver of a vehicle on a one-way street intersecting another one-way street
on which traffic moves to the left shall stop in obedience to a red or stop signal and may then make a
left turn into the one-way street, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting the movement,
but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by
the signal at that intersection.
   (ii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in subdivision 6,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
    (iii) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal, with the intention of making a movement
indicated by the arrow, must stop at a clearly marked stop line but, if none, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and
must remain standing until a permissive signal indication permitting the movement indicated by the
red arrow is displayed, except as follows: when an official sign has been erected permitting a turn
on a red arrow signal, the vehicular traffic facing a red arrow signal indication is permitted to enter
the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street on which
traffic moves to the left, after stopping, but must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other
traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by the signal at that intersection.
    (b) In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this section are applicable except those which can have no application.
Any stop required must be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop
must be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop must be made at the signal.
    (c) When a traffic-control signal indication or indications placed to control a certain movement
or lane are so identified by placing a sign near the indication or indications, no other traffic-control
signal indication or indications within the intersection controls vehicular traffic for that movement
or lane.
   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.06, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7. Flashing signal. When flashing red or yellow signals are used they shall require
obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
    (a) When a circular red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles
shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side
of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver
has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection, and
the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
    (b) When a red arrow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes drivers of vehicles with
the intention of making a movement indicated by the arrow shall stop at a clearly marked stop line,

but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at
the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the
rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
    (c) When a circular yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of
vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past the signals only with caution. But vehicular
traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and
to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time this signal is
exhibited. Vehicular traffic turning left or making a U-turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way
to other vehicles approaching from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate
hazard.
    (d) When a yellow arrow indication is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of
vehicles with the intention of making a movement indicated by the arrow may proceed through the
intersection or past the signals only with caution.
                                                  ­, but shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time this signal is
exhibited. Vehicular traffic turning left or making a U-turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way
to other vehicles approaching from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate
hazard.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.19, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Signal to turn. A signal of intention to turn right or left shall be given continuously
during not less than the last 100 feet traveled by the vehicle before turning. A person whose vehicle
is exiting a roundabout is exempt from the requirement in this subdivision.
   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.223, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
   Subd. 5. Other operation requirements and prohibitions. (a) A person operating a motorized
bicycle on a roadway shall ride as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway
except in one of the following situations:
   (1) when overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction;
   (2) when preparing for a left turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway; or
    (3) when reasonably necessary to avoid conditions, including fixed or moving objects, vehicles,
pedestrians, animals, surface hazards, or narrow width lanes, that make it unsafe to continue along
the right-hand curb or edge.
   (b) Persons operating motorized bicycles on a roadway may not ride more than two abreast
and may not impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic. On a laned roadway, a person
operating a motorized bicycle shall ride within a single lane.
    (c) This section does not permit the operation of a motorized bicycle on a bicycle path or bicycle
lane that is reserved for the exclusive use of nonmotorized traffic, except that an electric-assisted
bicycle may be operated on the path or lane if authorized under section 85.015, subdivision 1d;
85.018, subdivision 2, paragraph (d); or 160.263, subdivision 2, paragraph (b), as applicable.

     (b) A child passenger restraint system is not required for a child who cannot, in the judgment of
a licensed physician, be safely transported in a child passenger restraint system because of a medical
condition, body size, or physical disability. A motor vehicle operator claiming exemption for a child
under this paragraph must possess a typewritten statement from the physician stating that the child
cannot be safely transported in a child passenger restraint system. The statement must give the name
and birth date of the child, be dated within the previous six months, and be made on the physician's
letterhead or contain the physician's name, address, and telephone number. A person charged with
violating subdivision 5 may not be convicted if the person produces the physician's statement in
court or in the office of the arresting officer.
    (c) A person offering a motor vehicle for rent or lease shall provide a child passenger restraint
device to a customer renting or leasing the motor vehicle who requests the device. A reasonable rent
or fee may be charged for use of the child passenger restraint device.

vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less, and to provide an educational program on the need for
and proper use of child passenger restraint systems. The commissioner shall report to the legislature
by February 1 of each odd-numbered year on the commissioner's activities and expenditure of funds
under this section.
    Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.85, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Unloading. (a) Upon weighing a vehicle and load, as provided in this section, an officer
may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing until a portion of the
load is removed that is sufficient to reduce the gross weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted under
either section 168.013, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), or sections 169.823 to 169.829, whichever is
the lesser violation, if any. A suitable place is a location where loading or tampering with the load
is not prohibited by federal, state, or local law, rule, or ordinance.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c), a driver may be required to unload a vehicle only if
the weighing officer determines that (1) on routes subject to the provisions of sections 169.823 to
169.829, the weight on an axle exceeds the lawful gross weight prescribed by sections 169.823 to
169.829, by 2,000 pounds or more, or the weight on a group of two or more consecutive axles in cases
where the distance between the centers of the first and last axles of the group under consideration is
ten feet or less exceeds the lawful gross weight prescribed by sections 169.823 to 169.829, by 4,000
pounds or more; or (2) the weight is unlawful on an axle or group of consecutive axles on a road
restricted in accordance with section 169.87. Material unloaded must be cared for by the owner or
driver of the vehicle at the risk of the owner or driver.

jurisdiction of the party granting such permit and for the maintenance of which such party is
responsible.
    (b) Permits relating to over-width, over-length manufactured homes shall not be issued to
persons other than manufactured home dealers or manufacturers for movement of new units owned
by the manufactured home dealer or manufacturer, until the person has presented a statement from
the county auditor and treasurer where the unit is presently located, stating that all personal and real
property taxes have been paid. Upon payment of the most recent single year delinquent personal
property or current year taxes only, the county auditor or treasurer must issue a taxes paid statement
to a manufactured home dealer or a financial institution desiring to relocate a manufactured home
that has been repossessed. This statement must be dated within 30 days of the contemplated move.
The statement from the county auditor and treasurer where the unit is presently located, stating that
all personal and real property taxes have been paid, may be made by telephone. If the statement
is obtained by telephone, the permit shall contain the date and time of the telephone call and the
names of the persons in the auditor's office and treasurer's office who verified that all personal and
real property taxes had been paid.
    (c) The commissioner may not grant a permit authorizing the movement, in a three-vehicle
combination, of a semitrailer or trailer that exceeds 28-1/2 feet, except that the commissioner (1)
may renew a permit that was granted before April 16, 1984, for the movement of a semitrailer or
trailer that exceeds the length limitation in section 169.81, subdivision 2, or (2) may grant a permit
authorizing the transportation of empty trailers that exceed 28-1/2 feet when using a B-train hitching
mechanism as defined in Code of Federal Regulations, title 23, section 658.5, paragraph (o), from
a point of manufacture in the state to the state border.
    (d) The state as to state trunk highways, a statutory or home rule charter city as to streets in
the city, or a town as to roads in the town, may issue permits authorizing the transportation of
combinations of vehicles exceeding the limitations in section 169.81, subdivisions 2a and 3, over
highways, streets, or roads within its boundaries. Combinations of vehicles authorized by this
paragraph may be restricted as to the use of state trunk highways by the commissioner, to the use
of streets by the city road authority, and to the use of roads by the town road authority. Nothing in
this paragraph or section 169.81, subdivisions 2a and 3, alters or changes the authority vested in
local authorities under section 169.04.

applies to any vehicle described in section 168.013, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), but only when
the vehicle exceeds its gross weight allowance set forth in that paragraph, and then the additional
cost is for all weight, including the allowance weight, in excess of the permitted maximum axle
weight. The additional cost is equal to the product of the distance traveled times the sum of the
overweight axle group cost factors shown in the following chart:

The amounts added are rounded to the nearest cent for each axle or axle group. The additional cost
does not apply to paragraph (c), clauses (1) and (3).
For a vehicle found to exceed the appropriate maximum permitted weight, a cost-per-mile fee of 22
cents per ton, or fraction of a ton, over the permitted maximum weight is imposed in addition to the
normal permit fee. Miles must be calculated based on the distance already traveled in the state plus
the distance from the point of detection to a transportation loading site or unloading site within the
state or to the point of exit from the state.
   (f) As an alternative to paragraph (e), an annual permit may be issued for overweight, or oversize
and overweight, mobile cranes; construction equipment, machinery, and supplies; implements of
husbandry; and commercial boat hauling. The fees for the permit are as follows:

one year of limited license use without violating the ignition interlock restriction, the conditions of
limited license use, or program guidelines, the participant may apply for conditional reinstatement of
the driver's license, subject to the ignition interlock restriction. If the program participant's ignition
interlock device subsequently registers a positive breath alcohol concentration of 0.02 or higher, the
commissioner shall cancel the driver's license, and the program participant may apply for another
limited license according to this paragraph.
    (e) Notwithstanding any statute or rule to the contrary, the commissioner has authority to
determine when a program participant is eligible for restoration of full driving privileges, except
that the commissioner shall not reinstate full driving privileges until the program participant has
met all applicable prerequisites for reinstatement under section 169A.55 and until the program
participant's device has registered no positive breath alcohol concentrations of 0.02 or higher
during the preceding 90 days.
