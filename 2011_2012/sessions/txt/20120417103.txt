  "Section 1. [116L.99] MINNESOTA FASTTRAC ADULT CAREER PATHWAY
PROGRAM.
   Subdivision 1. Creation. There is created the Minnesota fast training, resources, and
credentialing adult career pathway program, hereafter referred to as FastTRAC.
    Subd. 2. Purpose. FastTRAC is an interagency adult career pathway initiative to increase the
number of adults with postsecondary credentials in high-demand occupations that lead to liveable
wages. This career pathway initiative is a series of connected education and training programs
and support services, the purpose of which is to enable individuals to secure employment within
a specific industry or occupational sector, and to advance over time to successively higher levels of
education and employment in that sector. Each step on a career pathway is explicitly designed to
prepare for the next level of employment and education.
    Subd. 3. Administration; leadership committee. The commissioner shall provide
administration and oversight of FastTRAC. The commissioner shall establish a FastTRAC
leadership committee which must include the department, Department of Education-Adult Basic
Education, Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System Office (MnSCU), Office of Higher
Education, Department of Human Services, Department of Labor and Industry, state and local

partners, and employers deemed necessary by the commissioner. The leadership committee
must develop and maintain interagency collaboration activities and provide advice and program
guidelines to the commissioner and the local program partners.
    Subd. 4. Program design. FastTRAC is designed to use an adult career pathways framework for
delivering education, training, and employment services to participants. This framework requires
programming and policy alignment across the Department of Education-Adult Basic Education,
WorkForce Center System, MnSCU, and other programs operated through the Department of
Human Services and other state agencies and offices that have related programming. FastTRAC
local program partners must also collaborate with employers, business and industry organizations,
and community-based organizations that provide training and employment services.
    Subd. 5. Program implementation. The leadership committee must ensure that FastTRAC
programs become standard options offered through state education and training systems by assisting
local program partners to overcome policy and other barriers to FastTRAC program approval and
delivery. Local program partners must utilize all available integrated data capabilities and provide
this data to the leadership committee to follow participant progress and outcomes across education
and employment programs.
    Subd. 6. Required local program partner. (a) For the purpose of this section, a local program
partner is defined as the organization that performs the service functions under this section and
is responsible for the delivery of outcomes under this section. A local program partner may have
relationships with other organizations that provide assistance, but the local program partner remains
solely accountable for outcomes.
   (b) A local program partner must include representatives from all of the following:
   (1) the Department of Education-Adult Basic Education;
   (2) employers;
   (3) MnSCU two-year institutions; and
   (4) workforce development system partners, including community-based organizations,
workforce investment boards, tribal nonprofit organizations, and the department.
    (c) A local program partner may be formed to address any of the program guidelines established
by the leadership committee. The leadership committee shall provide a standard form that local
partners must use to apply for FastTRAC funding and assistance.
   Subd. 7. Services provided. (a) A FastTRAC local program partner must provide three service
components to participants:
   (1) contextualized instruction;
   (2) career development; and
  (3) support services tailored to adults and delivered through collaboration of partners and in a
manner appropriate for the needs and circumstances of the participant.
   (b) Contextualized instruction must be provided that integrates industry and occupational
knowledge with basic reading, math, and language skills by having Department of Education-Adult

needed to transition across education and training programs and achieve stable career pathway
employment with a liveable wage. Examples of support service include, but are not limited to,
assisting participants with finding eligible public assistance programs, gas cards, bus cards, or child
care. Whenever possible the local program partners shall ensure that existing funding streams such
as MFIP are used to provide any services under this section.
   Subd. 8. Participant eligibility. (a) An eligible FastTRAC participant must meet the
requirements of the Department of Education-Adult Basic Education program under section
124D.52.
    (b) In addition to the requirement in paragraph (a), an eligible participant must be assessed, using
a nationally recognized assessment, and found to have either insufficient college readiness or work
readiness.
    (c) Participants must enroll in the FastTRAC program using a form supplied by the local program
partner.
    Subd. 9. Accountability and outcome measures. (a) All FastTRAC local program partners
must administer assessments consistent with program requirements to place participants into the
appropriate courses and to measure progress. All local program partners must coordinate with
state management information systems to analyze key information about FastTRAC participants
and graduates. This information must be provided to the leadership committee for review under
paragraph (c).
    (b) State systems, in partnership with Local program partners, must evaluate participants on all
of the measures in this paragraph.
    (1) Basic skills acquisition: Whether a participant has attained a NRS educational functioning
level (EFL) gain as adopted by the Department of Education-Adult Basic Education.
    (2) Program retention: Whether the participant partook in the duration of the program, including
information on attrition, identification of program challenges, or other barriers to program retention.

   (9) Participant satisfaction and other process goals as defined by the local program partner.
   (10) Employer involvement and feedback at the local level.
    (c) If the leadership committee determines that the evaluation criteria in paragraph (b) are not
sufficiently met, it retains the authority to reconsider funding opportunities to the local program
partner."

AMENDED PAY DIFFERENTIAL LAW FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT EMPLOYEES WHO
        ARE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD OR RESERVES
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 471.975, is amended to read:
   471.975 MAY PAY DIFFERENTIAL OF RESERVE ON ACTIVE DUTY.
    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a statutory or home rule charter city, county, town, or
other political subdivision may pay to each eligible member of the National Guard or other reserve
component of the armed forces of the United States an amount equal to the difference between the
member's base active duty military salary and the salary the member would be paid as an active
political subdivision employee, including any adjustments the member would have received if not
on leave of absence. This payment may be made only to a person whose base active duty military
salary is less than the salary the person would be paid as an active political subdivision employee.
Back pay authorized by this section may be paid in a lump sum. Payment under this section must not
extend beyond four years from the date the employee reported for active service, plus any additional
time the employee may be legally required to serve.
    (b) Subject to the limits under paragraph (g), each school district shall pay to each eligible
member of the National Guard or other reserve component of the armed forces of the United States
an amount equal to the difference between the member's base active duty military salary and the
salary the member would be paid as an active school district employee, including any adjustments
the member would have received if not on leave of absence. The pay differential must be based on
a comparison between the member's daily base rate of active duty pay, calculated by dividing the
member's base military monthly salary by the number of paid days in the month, and the member's
daily rate of pay for the member's school district salary, calculated by dividing the member's total
school district salary by the number of contract days. The member's salary as a school district
employee must include the member's basic salary and any additional salary the member earns from
the school district for cocurricular and extracurricular activities. The differential payment under this
paragraph must be the difference between the daily base rates of military pay times the number of
school district contract days the member misses because of military active duty. This payment may
be made only to a person whose daily base rate of active duty pay is less than the person's daily
rate of pay as an active school district employee. Payments may be made at the intervals at which
the member received pay as a school district employee. Payment under this section must not extend
beyond four years from the date the employee reported for active service, plus any additional time
the employee may be legally required to serve.
    (c) An eligible member of the reserve components of the armed forces of the United States is a
reservist or National Guard member who was an employee of a political subdivision at the time the
member reported for active service on or after May 29, 2003, or who is on active service on May
29, 2003.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) and elsewhere in Minnesota Statutes, a statutory or home
rule charter city, county, town, or other political subdivision has total discretion regarding employee
benefit continuation for a member who reports for active service and the terms and conditions of
any benefit.

    (e) A school district must continue the employee's enrollment in health and dental coverage, and
the employer contribution toward that coverage, until the employee is covered by health and dental
coverage provided by the armed forces. If the employee had elected dependent coverage for health
or dental coverage as of the time that the employee reported for active service, a school district must
offer the employee the option to continue the dependent coverage at the employee's own expense.
A school district must permit the employee to continue participating in any pretax account in which
the employee participated when the employee reported for active service, to the extent of employee
pay available for that purpose.
   (f) For purposes of this section, "active service" has the meaning given in section 190.05,
subdivision 5, but excludes service performed exclusively for purposes of:
   (1) basic combat training, advanced individual training, annual training, and periodic inactive
duty training;
     (2) special training periodically made available to reserve members; and
     (3) service performed in accordance with section 190.08, subdivision 3.
