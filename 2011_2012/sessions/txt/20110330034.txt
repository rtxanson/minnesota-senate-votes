    (a) If the commissioner of management and budget determines that modifications in the
payment schedule would reduce the need for state short-term borrowing, the commissioner may
modify payments to districts according to this section. The modifications must begin no sooner
than September 1 of each fiscal year, and must remain in effect until no later than May 30 of that
same fiscal year. In calculating the payment to a district pursuant to section 127A.45, subdivision
3, the commissioner may subtract the sum specified in that subdivision, plus an additional amount
no greater than the following:
   (1) the net cash balance in each of the district's operating funds on June 30 of the preceding fiscal
year; minus
   (2) the product of $700 times the number of resident pupil units in the preceding fiscal year;
minus
    (3) the amount of payments made by the county treasurer during the preceding fiscal year,
pursuant to section 276.11, which is considered revenue for the current school year. However, no
additional amount shall be subtracted if the total of the net unappropriated fund balances in the
district's four operating funds on June 30 of the preceding fiscal year, is less than the product of

$700 times the number of resident pupil units in the preceding fiscal year. The net cash balance
must include all cash and investments, less certificates of indebtedness outstanding, and orders not
paid for want of funds.
   (b) A district may appeal the payment schedule established by this section according to the
procedures established in section 127A.45, subdivision 4.
    (c) The commissioner of education shall calculate the interest on delayed school district
payments based on the average daily invested treasurer's cash interest during the period in which
the delayed payments are in effect. The amount of this interest shall be included in the payments to
districts by May 30. The amounts necessary to make this interest payment are appropriated to the
commissioner."

    (b) Members of a unitary business that are required to file a combined report on one return must
designate a member of the unitary business to be responsible for tax matters, including the filing of
returns, the payment of taxes, additions to tax, penalties, interest, or any other payment, and for the
receipt of refunds of taxes or interest paid in excess of taxes lawfully due. The designated member
must be a member of the unitary business that is filing the single combined report and either:
    (1) a corporation that is subject to the taxes imposed by chapter 290; or
    (2) a corporation that is not subject to the taxes imposed by chapter 290:
   (i) Such corporation consents by filing the return as a designated member under this clause to
remit taxes, penalties, interest, or additions to tax due from the members of the unitary business
subject to tax, and receive refunds or other payments on behalf of other members of the unitary
business. The member designated under this clause is a "taxpayer" for the purposes of this chapter
and chapter 270C, and is liable for any liability imposed on the unitary business under this chapter
and chapter 290.
    (ii) If the state does not otherwise have the jurisdiction to tax the member designated under this
clause, consenting to be the designated member does not create the jurisdiction to impose tax on the
designated member, other than as described in item (i).
   (iii) The member designated under this clause must apply for a business tax account identification
number.
    (c) The commissioner shall adopt rules for the filing of one return on behalf of the members
of an affiliated group of corporations that are required to file a combined report. All members of
an affiliated group that are required to file a combined report must file one return on behalf of the
members of the group under rules adopted by the commissioner.
    (d) If a corporation claims on a return that it has paid tax in excess of the amount of taxes lawfully

    Subd. 4. Unitary business principle. (a) If a trade or business conducted wholly within this
state or partly within and partly without this state is part of a unitary business, the entire income
of the unitary business is subject to apportionment pursuant to section 290.191. Notwithstanding
subdivision 2, paragraph (c), none of the income of a unitary business is considered to be derived
from any particular source and none may be allocated to a particular place except as provided by
the applicable apportionment formula. The provisions of this subdivision do not apply to business
income subject to subdivision 5, income of an insurance company, or income of an investment
company determined under section 290.36.
    (b) The term "unitary business" means business activities or operations which result in a flow of
value between them. The term may be applied within a single legal entity or between multiple entities
and without regard to whether each entity is a sole proprietorship, a corporation, a partnership or a
trust.
    (c) Unity is presumed whenever there is unity of ownership, operation, and use, evidenced by
centralized management or executive force, centralized purchasing, advertising, accounting, or other
controlled interaction, but the absence of these centralized activities will not necessarily evidence
a nonunitary business. Unity is also presumed when business activities or operations are of mutual
benefit, dependent upon or contributory to one another, either individually or as a group.
    (d) Where a business operation conducted in Minnesota is owned by a business entity that carries
on business activity outside the state different in kind from that conducted within this state, and the
other business is conducted entirely outside the state, it is presumed that the two business operations
are unitary in nature, interrelated, connected, and interdependent unless it can be shown to the
contrary.
    (e) Unity of ownership is not deemed to exist when a corporation is involved unless that
corporation is a member of a group of two or more business entities and more than 50 percent
of the voting stock of each member of the group is directly or indirectly owned by a common
owner or by common owners, either corporate or noncorporate, or by one or more of the member
corporations of the group. For this purpose, the term "voting stock" shall include membership
interests of mutual insurance holding companies formed under section 66A.40.
    (f) The net income and apportionment factors under section 290.191 or 290.20 of foreign
corporations and other foreign entities which are part of a unitary business shall not be included in
the net income or the apportionment factors of the unitary business, except that foreign corporations
or other foreign entities that are included on a federal income tax return must be included on the

included in federal taxable income, as defined in section 63 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended through the date named in section 290.01, subdivision 19, and the proportionate
amount of apportionment factors, must be included in the combined report. A foreign corporation
or other foreign entity which is not included on a combined report and which is required to file a
return under this chapter shall file on a separate return basis. T                     ­­h­e­n­­e­t­­n

beverages, cigarettes, or tobacco products are sold to a purchaser who is licensed by a state or
political subdivision to resell this property only within the state of ultimate destination, the sale is
made in that state.
   (e) Sales made by or through a corporation that is qualified as a domestic international sales
corporation under section 992 of the Internal Revenue Code are not considered to have been made
within this state.
    (f) Sales, rents, royalties, and other income in connection with real property is attributed to the
state in which the property is located.
    (g) Receipts from the lease or rental of tangible personal property, including finance leases and
true leases, must be attributed to this state if the property is located in this state and to other states
if the property is not located in this state. Receipts from the lease or rental of moving property
including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, rolling stock, aircraft, vessels, or mobile equipment
are included in the numerator of the receipts factor to the extent that the property is used in this state.
The extent of the use of moving property is determined as follows:
   (1) A motor vehicle is used wholly in the state in which it is registered.
    (2) The extent that rolling stock is used in this state is determined by multiplying the receipts
from the lease or rental of the rolling stock by a fraction, the numerator of which is the miles traveled
within this state by the leased or rented rolling stock and the denominator of which is the total miles
traveled by the leased or rented rolling stock.
    (3) The extent that an aircraft is used in this state is determined by multiplying the receipts from
the lease or rental of the aircraft by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of landings of
the aircraft in this state and the denominator of which is the total number of landings of the aircraft.
    (4) The extent that a vessel, mobile equipment, or other mobile property is used in the state is
determined by multiplying the receipts from the lease or rental of the property by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days during the taxable year the property was in this state and
the denominator of which is the total days in the taxable year.
     (h) Royalties and other income not described in paragraph (a), clause (6), received for the use
of or for the privilege of using intangible property, including patents, know-how, formulas, designs,
processes, patterns, copyrights, trade names, service names, franchises, licenses, contracts, customer
lists, or similar items, must be attributed to the state in which the property is used by the purchaser.
If the property is used in more than one state, the royalties or other income must be apportioned
to this state pro rata according to the portion of use in this state. If the portion of use in this state
cannot be determined, the royalties or other income must be excluded from both the numerator and
the denominator. Intangible property is used in this state if the purchaser uses the intangible property
or the rights therein in the regular course of its business operations in this state, regardless of the
location of the purchaser's customers.
    (i) Sales of intangible property are made within the state in which the property is used by the
purchaser. If the property is used in more than one state, the sales must be apportioned to this state
pro rata according to the portion of use in this state. If the portion of use in this state cannot be
determined, the sale must be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator of the sales
factor. Intangible property is used in this state if the purchaser used the intangible property in the

regular course of its business operations in this state.
    (j) Receipts from the performance of services must be attributed to the state where the services
are received. For the purposes of this section, receipts from the performance of services provided
to a corporation, partnership, or trust may only be attributed to a state where it has a fixed place of
doing business. If the state where the services are received is not readily determinable or is a state
where the corporation, partnership, or trust receiving the service does not have a fixed place of doing
business, the services shall be deemed to be received at the location of the office of the customer
from which the services were ordered in the regular course of the customer's trade or business. If
the ordering office cannot be determined, the services shall be deemed to be received at the office
of the customer to which the services are billed.
    (k) For the purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 6, paragraph (l), receipts from
management, distribution, or administrative services performed by a corporation or trust for a fund
of a corporation or trust regulated under United States Code, title 15, sections 80a-1 through 80a-64,
must be attributed to the state where the shareholder of the fund resides. Under this paragraph,
receipts for services attributed to shareholders are determined on the basis of the ratio of: (1) the
average of the outstanding shares in the fund owned by shareholders residing within Minnesota
at the beginning and end of each year; and (2) the average of the total number of outstanding
shares in the fund at the beginning and end of each year. Residence of the shareholder, in the case
of an individual, is determined by the mailing address furnished by the shareholder to the fund.
Residence of the shareholder, when the shares are held by an insurance company as a depositor for
the insurance company policyholders, is the mailing address of the policyholders. In the case of an
insurance company holding the shares as a depositor for the insurance company policyholders, if
the mailing address of the policyholders cannot be determined by the taxpayer, the receipts must be
excluded from both the numerator and denominator. Residence of other shareholders is the mailing
address of the shareholder.

   "Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256.9657, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Hospital surcharge. (a) Effective October 1, 1992, each Minnesota hospital except
facilities of the federal Indian Health Service and regional treatment centers shall pay to the medical
assistance account a surcharge equal to 1.4 percent of net patient revenues excluding net Medicare
revenues reported by that provider to the health care cost information system according to the
schedule in subdivision 4.
   (b) Effective July 1, 1994, the surcharge under paragraph (a) is increased to 1.56 percent.
   (c) Effective July 1, 2011, the surcharge under paragraph (b) is increased to 4.45 percent.

surcharge is not an allowable cost for purposes of rate setting under sections 256.9685 to 256.9695.

   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256.969, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. Payments. (a) Acute care hospital billings under the medical assistance program
must not be submitted until the recipient is discharged. However, the commissioner shall establish
monthly interim payments for inpatient hospitals that have individual patient lengths of stay
over 30 days regardless of diagnostic category. Except as provided in section 256.9693, medical
assistance reimbursement for treatment of mental illness shall be reimbursed based on diagnostic
classifications. Individual hospital payments established under this section and sections 256.9685,

during the rate year shall not exceed, in aggregate, the charges for the medical assistance covered

limitation on general assistance medical care shall be effective for admissions occurring on or
after July 1, 1991. Services that have rates established under subdivision 11 or 12, must be limited
separately from other services. After consulting with the affected hospitals, the commissioner may
consider related hospitals one entity and may merge the payment rates while maintaining separate
provider numbers. The operating and property base rates per admission or per day shall be derived
from the best Medicare and claims data available when rates are established. The commissioner
shall determine the best Medicare and claims data, taking into consideration variables of recency
of the data, audit disposition, settlement status, and the ability to set rates in a timely manner. The
commissioner shall notify hospitals of payment rates by December 1 of the year preceding the
rate year. The rate setting data must reflect the admissions data used to establish relative values.
Base year changes from 1981 to the base year established for the rate year beginning January 1,
1991, and for subsequent rate years, shall not be limited to the limits ending June 30, 1987, on
the maximum rate of increase under subdivision 1. The commissioner may adjust base year cost,
relative value, and case mix index data to exclude the costs of services that have been discontinued
by the October 1 of the year preceding the rate year or that are paid separately from inpatient
services. Inpatient stays that encompass portions of two or more rate years shall have payments

must notify the commissioner of human services within ten working days after receiving written
notification. If the notification is received by the commissioner of human services by the 15th of the

of beds. The commissioner may reduce, and may subsequently restore, the surcharge under this
subdivision based on the commissioner's determination of a permissible surcharge.

    Page 4, after line 3, insert:
    "Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256.9657, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Hospital surcharge. (a) Effective October 1, 1992, each Minnesota hospital except
facilities of the federal Indian Health Service and regional treatment centers shall pay to the medical
assistance account a surcharge equal to 1.4 percent of net patient revenues excluding net Medicare
revenues reported by that provider to the health care cost information system according to the
schedule in subdivision 4.
    (b) Effective July 1, 1994, the surcharge under paragraph (a) is increased to 1.56 percent.
    (c) Effective July 1, 2011, the surcharge under paragraph (b) is increased to 4.97 percent.
    (d) Notwithstanding the Medicare cost finding and allowable cost principles, the hospital
surcharge is not an allowable cost for purposes of rate setting under sections 256.9685 to 256.9695.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2011.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256.969, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. Payments. (a) Acute care hospital billings under the medical assistance program
must not be submitted until the recipient is discharged. However, the commissioner shall establish
monthly interim payments for inpatient hospitals that have individual patient lengths of stay
over 30 days regardless of diagnostic category. Except as provided in section 256.9693, medical
assistance reimbursement for treatment of mental illness shall be reimbursed based on diagnostic
classifications. Individual hospital payments established under this section and sections 256.9685,
256.9686, and 256.9695, in addition to third-party and recipient liability, for discharges occurring
during the rate year shall not exceed, in aggregate, the charges for the medical assistance covered
inpatient services paid for the same period of time to the hospital. This payment limitation shall
be calculated separately for medical assistance and general assistance medical care services. The
limitation on general assistance medical care shall be effective for admissions occurring on or
after July 1, 1991. Services that have rates established under subdivision 11 or 12, must be limited
separately from other services. After consulting with the affected hospitals, the commissioner may
consider related hospitals one entity and may merge the payment rates while maintaining separate
provider numbers. The operating and property base rates per admission or per day shall be derived
from the best Medicare and claims data available when rates are established. The commissioner
shall determine the best Medicare and claims data, taking into consideration variables of recency
of the data, audit disposition, settlement status, and the ability to set rates in a timely manner. The
commissioner shall notify hospitals of payment rates by December 1 of the year preceding the
rate year. The rate setting data must reflect the admissions data used to establish relative values.
Base year changes from 1981 to the base year established for the rate year beginning January 1,

1991, and for subsequent rate years, shall not be limited to the limits ending June 30, 1987, on
the maximum rate of increase under subdivision 1. The commissioner may adjust base year cost,
relative value, and case mix index data to exclude the costs of services that have been discontinued
by the October 1 of the year preceding the rate year or that are paid separately from inpatient
services. Inpatient stays that encompass portions of two or more rate years shall have payments
established based on payment rates in effect at the time of admission unless the date of admission
preceded the rate year in effect by six months or more. In this case, operating payment rates for
services rendered during the rate year in effect and established based on the date of admission shall
be adjusted to the rate year in effect by the hospital cost index.
    (b) For fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2002, the total payment, before
third-party liability and spenddown, made to hospitals for inpatient services is reduced by .5 percent

health services within diagnosis related groups 424 to 432 and facilities defined under subdivision 16
are excluded from this paragraph. Notwithstanding section 256.9686, subdivision 7, for purposes
of this paragraph, medical assistance does not include general assistance medical care. Payments
made to managed care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after January 1, 2006, to
reflect this reduction.
    (e) In addition to the reductions in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), the total payment for
fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2009, made to

medical assistance, excluding general assistance medical care, occurring on or after July 1, 1990,

   "Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0911, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. Assessment and support planning. (a) Persons requesting assessment, services
planning, or other assistance intended to support community-based living, including persons who
need assessment in order to determine waiver or alternative care program eligibility, must be
visited by a long-term care consultation team within 15 calendar days after the date on which an
assessment was requested or recommended. After January 1, 2011, these requirements also apply
to personal care assistance services, private duty nursing, and home health agency services, on
timelines established in subdivision 5. Face-to-face assessments must be conducted according to
paragraphs (b) to (i).
    (b) The county may utilize a team of either the social worker or public health nurse, or both.
After January 1, 2011, lead agencies shall use certified assessors to conduct the assessment in a
face-to-face interview. The consultation team members must confer regarding the most appropriate
care for each individual screened or assessed.
    (c) The assessment must be comprehensive and include a person-centered assessment of the
health, psychological, functional, environmental, and social needs of referred individuals and
provide information necessary to develop a support plan that meets the consumers needs, using an
assessment form provided by the commissioner.
    (d) The assessment must be conducted in a face-to-face interview with the person being
assessed and the person's legal representative, as required by legally executed documents, and other
individuals as requested by the person, who can provide information on the needs, strengths, and
preferences of the person necessary to develop a support plan that ensures the person's health and
safety, but who is not a provider of service or has any financial interest in the provision of services.
With the permission of the person being assessed or the persons' designated or legal representative,
the client's provider of services may submit a copy of the provider's nursing assessment or written
report outlining their recommendations regarding the client's care needs. The person conducting
the assessment will notify the provider of the date by which this information is to be submitted.
This information shall be provided to the person conducting the assessment prior to the assessment.
    (e) The person, or the person's legal representative, must be provided with written
recommendations for community-based services, including consumer-directed options, or
institutional care that include documentation that the most cost-effective alternatives available
were offered to the individual. For purposes of this requirement, "cost-effective alternatives" means
community services and living arrangements that cost the same as or less than institutional care.
    (f) If the person chooses to use community-based services, the person or the person's legal
representative must be provided with a written community support plan, regardless of whether
the individual is eligible for Minnesota health care programs. A person may request assistance in
identifying community supports without participating in a complete assessment. Upon a request for
assistance identifying community support, the person must be transferred or referred to the services
available under sections 256.975, subdivision 7, and 256.01, subdivision 24, for telephone assistance
and follow up.
   (g) The person has the right to make the final decision between institutional placement and
community placement after the recommendations have been provided, except as provided in
subdivision 4a, paragraph (c).

    (h) The team must give the person receiving assessment or support planning, or the person's
legal representative, materials, and forms supplied by the commissioner containing the following
information:
    (1) the need for and purpose of preadmission screening if the person selects nursing facility
placement;
    (2) the role of the long-term care consultation assessment and support planning in waiver and
alternative care program eligibility determination;
   (3) information about Minnesota health care programs;
   (4) the person's freedom to accept or reject the recommendations of the team;
   (5) the person's right to confidentiality under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act,
chapter 13;
    (6) the long-term care consultant's decision regarding the person's need for institutional level of
care as determined under criteria established in section 144.0724, subdivision 11, or 256B.092; and
    (7) the person's right to appeal the decision regarding the need for nursing facility level of care
or the county's final decisions regarding public programs eligibility according to section 256.045,
subdivision 3.
    (i) Face-to-face assessment completed as part of eligibility determination for the alternative care,
elderly waiver, community alternatives for disabled individuals, community alternative care, and
traumatic brain injury waiver programs under sections 256B.0915, 256B.0917, and 256B.49 is valid
to establish service eligibility for no more than 60 calendar days after the date of assessment. The
effective eligibility start date for these programs can never be prior to the date of assessment. If an
assessment was completed more than 60 days before the effective waiver or alternative care program
eligibility start date, assessment and support plan information must be updated in a face-to-face
visit and documented in the department's Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS). The
effective date of program eligibility in this case cannot be prior to the date the updated assessment
is completed."

    (e) An individual who is not a Minnesota resident for the entire year must compute the
individual's Minnesota income tax as provided in this subdivision. After the application of the
nonrefundable credits provided in this chapter, the tax liability must then be multiplied by a fraction
in which:
    (1) the numerator is the individual's Minnesota source federal adjusted gross income as defined
in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code and increased by the additions required under section
290.01, subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (12), (13), (16), and (17), and reduced
by the Minnesota assignable portion of the subtraction for United States government interest under
section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clause (1), and the subtractions under section 290.01, subdivision
19b, clauses (8), (9), (13), (14), (15), and (17), after applying the allocation and assignability
provisions of section 290.081, clause (a), or 290.17; and
   (2) the denominator is the individual's federal adjusted gross income as defined in section
62 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, increased by the amounts specified in section 290.01,
subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (12), (13), (16), and (17), and reduced by the
amounts specified in section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clauses (1), (8), (9), (13), (14), (15), and (17).

1 shall clearly advise parents of infants prior to administering the tests (1) that the blood or tissue
samples used to perform testing thereunder as well as the results of such testing may be retained
by the Department of Health, (2) the benefit of retaining the blood or tissue sample, and (3) that
the following options are available to them with respect to the testing: (i) to decline to have the
tests, or (ii) to elect to have the tests but to require that all blood samples and records of test results
be destroyed within 24 months of the testing. The person with a duty to perform testing under
subdivision 1 shall make a notation in the infant's medical record that the infant's parents have been
provided with this information. If the parents of an infant object in writing to testing for heritable and
congenital disorders or elect to require that blood samples and test results be destroyed, the objection
or election shall be recorded on a form that is signed by a parent or legal guardian and made part
of the infant's medical record. A written objection exempts an infant from the requirements of this
