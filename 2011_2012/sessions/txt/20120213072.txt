3778                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [72ND DAY

Dear Madam President:
    With this letter, I am vetoing and returning Chapter 118, Senate File 149, which addresses the
unrelated topics of conciliation court claim limits and class action appeals. These provisions are
not consistent with the court's recommendations for effectively addressing small claims, represent
legislative meddling with court procedures best handled by the judiciary, and do not address
legitimate problems in Minnesota.
    A recent study by the National Center for State Courts revealed that 72% of the civil case load
in Minnesota is consumed by small claims and contract matters, while civil tort claims represent
less than 3% of the cases. The Legislature should be addressing the areas of the court that consume
the bulk of its workload. Unfortunately, this legislation misses that mark.
   The Minnesota Supreme Court Civil Justice Task Force recently rejected the change in
conciliation court claim levels contained in Section 1, because it would not have a significant
impact on the courts' workloads. Additionally, the Task Force did not recommend the change in
consumer credit cases contained in Section 1, and does not recommend making changes to this
type of claim without significant changes regarding the evidence required for such matters. The
Legislature has completely ignored the findings of the courts.
    Furthermore, Section 2 is an attempt by the Legislature to control the internal workings of
the court and its processes. Legislatively mandating specific interlocutory appeals in class action
cases and staying the discovery process while an appeal is pending blur the separation of powers
between the branches of government. The courts are in the best position to determine interim appeal
processes, and they are correctly in control of procedures for the discovery of evidence.
    The House author of this legislation indicated that there were only eight cases last year where
this provision would be applicable - and not a single case without merit. The bill would not create
jobs; rather it would set a dangerous precedent. I am certainly willing to consider reforms that will
assist our courts with their workload and address real problems within our justice system. Such an
endeavor must involve our courts and their expertise in these matters. This legislation does not, and
I will not sign it into law.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Mark Dayton, Governor
   Senator Senjem moved that S.F. No. 149 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table. The
motion prevailed.

                                                                                 February 10, 2012
The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
Dear Madam President:
    I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 119, Senate File 373, which drastically lowers the
statute of limitations for many important civil claims. This legislation does not represent justice
for Minnesotans. It would eliminate important protections for citizens and businesses, when they
are harmed by the wrongful actions of others.
72ND DAY]                       MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2012                                       3779

    I am perplexed by the charge that Minnesota is an excessively litigious state or has a negative
civil justice system for business. According to the Minnesota Supreme Court, civil case filings for
injury claims are down over 40% since 1997, despite our expanding population. The U.S. Chamber
of Commerce ranks Minnesota among the very top states for our treatment of businesses in the
courtroom. Those and other comparisons affirm that our court system is working well to protect our
Constitutional rights and is not being overburdened by frivolous matters.
    Despite those facts, this legislation would lower by one-third the statute of limitation for
Minnesota citizens and businesses to assert their rights in court. The current statute of six years
was established in 1841 and has remained largely unchanged since that time. Minnesota's current
statute of limitations is not out of line with other states, that have a "discovery rule" to allow an
individual or company to learn of the harm sustained before the limitations period begins. In fact,
we now have a shorter limitation period for many types of cases.
    I am particularly concerned about lowering the limitation period for contract cases for businesses
and consumers. Many companies may not learn of their claims within this shorter period. The
Legislature has enacted laws to help businesses assert their rights at the behest of very important
Minnesota companies, like Marvin Windows in Warroad. I see no justifiable reason to harm our
businesses by taking away this important right of redress. A four-year limitation period would be
a disadvantage to good Minnesota businesses. This legislation would end the exposure of large,
mostly out-of-state insurance companies to pay legitimate claims two years earlier than the current
law.
   I will not support that change.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Mark Dayton, Governor
   Senator Senjem moved that S.F. No. 373 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table. The
motion prevailed.

                                                                                  February 10, 2012
The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
Dear Madam President:
   With this letter, I am vetoing and returning Chapter 120, Senate File 429, a measure that has
been rejected several times by the legislature and the courts.
    I am deeply concerned that this legislation would make it more difficult for average citizens
to defend themselves against powerful interests. The suggestion that passage of this measure will
somehow create jobs in Minnesota lacks merit and substantiation. Not a single job would be created
- but important protections would be greatly impaired.
   Over 300 Minnesota statutes require the shifting of attorney fees to the wrongdoer - all of which
would be negatively impacted by this legislation. Deployed military personnel, farmers, vulnerable
adults, and victims of workplace harassment, wrongful termination, and discrimination are just a
few of the classes of individuals that would be harmed by this legislation.
3780                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [72ND DAY

    This legislation would require that attorneys' fee awards must be in proportion to the damages
awarded in a civil case. This requirement would seriously undermine the legislative purpose for
enacting statutes that allow Minnesota businesses, consumers, and employees to collect their
damages - plus reasonable attorney fees - for certain wrongful conduct. A rule of proportionality
would make it difficult, if not impossible, for individuals to bring important and meritorious
claims of relatively small value. To ensure that those claims are brought forward, the legislature
has shifted the costs of bringing the claim to the negligent party, and rightly so. This legislation
removes that protection.
    Further, the courts already review fee awards to ascertain that they are in relation to the recovery.
However, the court will also consider other relevant factors like the time involved in the case and
the nature of the controversy. No evidence has been presented that the current system is unfair to
those found in violation of Minnesota laws.
    Additionally, the legislation would change the process for settlements under Rule 68 of the
Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure. The Minnesota Supreme Court Rules Committee thoroughly
reviewed, and rejected, the changes proposed in this bill in 2008. The Supreme Court Task Force
on Civil Justice again rejected this change in its December 2011 report.
    The experts on these Supreme Court committees, including judges and lawyers who represent
plaintiffs and defendants, are in the best position to understand the impact of this change on
Minnesotans. They have soundly and repeatedly rejected this concept, and I will rely upon their
wisdom.
   Eliminating Minnesotans' rights to redress and trial by jury is not a jobs program. This bill would
benefit those who commit fraud, negligently injure our citizens and businesses, or allow an unfair
work environment. I will not agree to it.
                                                       Sincerely,
                                                       Mark Dayton, Governor
   Senator Senjem moved that S.F. No. 429 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table. The
motion prevailed.

                                                                                     February 10, 2012
The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
Dear Madam President:
    With this letter, I am vetoing and returning Chapter 121, Senate File 530, which would lower
the interest rate on judgements for negligent parties and their insurance companies. This bill is a
step backwards for justice. Minnesota citizens and business deserve fair compensation, when they
are harmed by the wrongful actions of others. This bill does the opposite.
    Current low investment rates should not be the measure of damages in large cases over $50,000.
Consumers or businesses, who have to borrow funds during a case, must often pay interest in excess
of the 4% rate allowed in this legislation, and sometimes even greater than the 10% allowed under
current law.
72ND DAY]                       MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2012                                     3781

    The requirement to pay prejudgment interest has three important policy goals: fairly compensate
for the losses from the time of the injury; promote prompt payment of legitimate claims; and prevent
frivolous delays by insurance companies. Minnesota's current law accomplishes those objectives
on large damage cases. It is important to remember that a defendant required to pay prejudgment
interest has been found responsible for causing the harm. They should appropriately compensate
those they have damaged - with no incentive to delay payment.
    Minnesota's prejudgment interest rate is also reasonable and balanced when compared to other
states. Approval of this legislation would give Minnesota one of the lowest prejudgment rates in the
country.
    Lastly, I find it objectionable that the Legislature allowed prejudgment interest for businesses
with commercial insurance policy claims at 10%, but lowered similar claims for average citizens
to 4%. It is yet another example of the Republican majorities favoring their business friends over
other Minnesotans.
   I am willing to consider changes to our civil laws that help Minnesota businesses and citizens
obtain justice in our courts and recover promptly from insurance companies. I can see no measurable
benefit to policyholders or average Minnesotans from this bill, and, therefore, I am vetoing it.
                                                    Sincerely,
                                                    Mark Dayton, Governor
   Senator Senjem moved that S.F. No. 530 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table. The
motion prevailed.

   (b) The commissioner must be as inclusive as possible in specifying contracts for construction
work, as well as for construction-related goods and services, available under this bid preference
program for veteran-owned small businesses. The term "construction" must be given broad
meaning for purposes of specifying and letting contracts for veteran-owned small businesses

small businesses. The commissioner must establish a procedure for granting waivers from the
subcontracting requirement when qualified veteran-owned small businesses are not reasonably
available. The commissioner may establish financial incentives for prime contractors who exceed
the goals for use of veteran-owned small business subcontractors and financial penalties for prime

pursuant to the provisions of subdivisions 2, 2a, and 3, the award may be placed pursuant to the
normal solicitation and award provisions set forth in this chapter and chapter 16C.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for contracts let on or after July 1, 2012.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 161.321, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9. Purpose. The state of Minnesota recognizes that veterans bring education, training,
values, leadership, and teamwork to the workplace. The purpose of this section is to facilitate the
healthy transition of veterans from military to civilian life, and to help compensate veterans for their
sacrifices including, but not limited to, their sacrifice of health and time to the state and nation during
their military service, as well as to enhance economic development within Minnesota.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for contracts let on or after July 1, 2012.

requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 161.321, subdivision 6, as they would otherwise apply
to this article. During this one-year exemption period, the commissioner of transportation shall
establish an expedited procedure for determining that a business is eligible for a set-aside under
this article.
