The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
Dear Madam President:
    I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 243, Senate File 1694, a bill which would legalize the
sale and use of additional kinds of fireworks in Minnesota.
     I greatly respect the care with which the legislative authors crafted it, especially their willingness
to listen to and incorporate the concerns of people with differing views. Their work is a role model
for the legislative process.
   Much as I would like to reward their efforts and to satisfy the many Minnesotans who want
113TH DAY]                          MONDAY, APRIL 30, 2012                                        6761

greater latitude to buy and use fireworks legally in our state, I cannot do so. Most Minnesotans are
responsible enough to ignite and explode those inherently dangerous devices properly and safely.
Unfortunately, some are not.
    It is government's foremost responsibility to protect the safety and the well-being of its citizens.
Sometimes that requires laws, which protect citizens from others. Sometimes, it requires laws to
protect people from themselves. In this case, government has the responsibility to do its utmost
to protect vulnerable young Minnesotans courageous firefighters and police offices, and innocent
bystanders of all ages, who could become victims of someone else's carelessness.
    The Minnesota-specific data on fireworks-related injuries and property damage are telling. Prior
to 2002, essentially all consumer fireworks were illegal in Minnesota. In 2002, certain types of
non-aerial and non-explosive fireworks were legalized. During the ten years prior to the 2002 law
change, 350 fireworks-related injuries were reported in Minnesota (an average of 35 per year) during
the week prior to and following the July 4th holiday. Since 2002, there have been 790 reported
injuries (average of 79 per year) during the same two-week period­a 111 percent increase. Fifty-two
percent of injuries over this period were suffered by persons 19 years old and younger and 22 percent
were injuries to children nine years old and younger.
    Property damage statistics showed a similar trend. In the decade before the 2002 law change,
reported property loss from fireworks totaled $908,530. Since 2002, property damage from fireworks
has totaled $4,564,845­a 500 percent increase. Expanding the array of legally-available fireworks
products, particularly to explosive and aerial varieties, can only be expected to exacerbate these
statistics.
   That is why the bill is opposed by the State Fire Marshall, the Minnesota Commissioner of Public
Safety, and the following organizations:
   Minnesota Professional Fire Fighters Association
   Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association
   Minnesota State Fire Chiefs Association
   Minnesota Safety Council

    The Minnesota Professional Firefighters wrote me: "Make no mistake - fireworks are
exceedingly dangerous to persons, property, and limbs. Our members have fought fires caused by
fireworks. They have responded to medical emergencies where children have been disfigured as
a result of unexpected explosions. The bottom line is that even well supervised fireworks use is
exceedingly dangerous."
    The Minnesota Academy of Ophthalmology wrote: "On behalf of the Minnesota Academy
of Ophthalmology, representing over 270 eye physicians and surgeons across Minnesota, we
are writing to express our concerns with the potential for an increase in the number of serious
eye injuries from the further proliferation of dangerous fireworks. Fireworks are by their nature
dangerous instruments involving explosions, accelerants and projectiles that have the potential to
cause devastating injuries to face and eyes. Please VETO the recently passed legislation."
   I hereby veto it.

6764                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [113TH DAY

Dear Madam President:
   I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 256, Senate File 1933, a bill creating a health care
compact.
    This bill would allow Minnesota to join with a group of other states seeking to "suspend...the
operation of all federal laws, rules, regulations, and orders regarding health care...." In exchange
for blanket authority to withdraw your participation from federal programs such as Medicare
and Medicaid, the bill presumes Minnesota would receive a capped block grant from the federal
government, estimated at $13.5 billion per year. Notably, that amount of money would be frozen,
with no future adjustment for changes in the number of Minnesotans who are elderly or who have
disabilities.
    This bill would be a drastic departure from our current system of shared state and federal
responsibility for delivering health care services. It would reverse nearly five decades of federal
involvement in health care policy. While certainly not perfect, our current cooperative relationship
offers great flexibility to states to operate as laboratories of policy innovation, while satisfying
certain basic, minimum federal requirements.
    Far beyond any objection to the federal Affordable Care Act, this bill asserts the notion that the
federal government has no authority for health policy whatsoever. Furthermore, the bill makes a
presumption that the federal government would simply hand over billions of federal dollars to state
policymakers, to do what they may, with no restrictions, limitations or oversight.
    Regrettably, this Legislature has almost completely ignored the very real opportunity to
assert greater control over our health care system by establishing a state-level health insurance
exchange. In January, a broad-based Health Insurance Exchange Task Force released a set of
recommendations reflecting a balanced, thoughtful approach and the consensus views of its diverse
members. Those recommendations laid the foundation for a Minnesota-designed Exchange to
provide affordable health insurance to more than one million Minnesotans, including hundreds of
thousands of small business employees. One recent, non-partisan analysis estimated a state health
insurance exchange would reduce the number of uninsured Minnesotans by 290,000 - almost 60%
of our citizens currently without health insurance.
   As I have previously stated, genuine and lasting health care reform legislation should be
bipartisan, non-ideological, and constructive. This bill fails those prerequisites.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Mark Dayton, Governor

    Senator Carlson moved that his name be stricken as chief author and the name of Senator Rosen
be added as chief author to S.F. No. 1856. The motion prevailed.

                                        HEALTH BOARDS
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 214.09, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 5. Health-related boards. No current member of a health-related licensing board may
seek a paid employment position with that board.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 214.103, is amended to read:
  214.103  HEALTH-RELATED                       LICENSING            BOARDS;           COMPLAINT,
INVESTIGATION, AND HEARING.
    Subdivision 1. Application. For purposes of this section, "board" means "health-related
licensing board" and does not include the non-health-related licensing boards. Nothing in this
section supersedes section 214.10, subdivisions 2a, 3, 8, and 9, as they apply to the health-related
licensing boards.
    Subd. 1a. Notifications and resolution. (a) No more than 14 calendar days after receiving a
complaint regarding a licensee, the board shall notify the complainant that the board has received
the complaint and shall provide the complainant with the written description of the board's complaint
process. The board shall periodically, but no less than every 120 days, notify the complainant of the
status of the complaint consistent with section 13.41.
   (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d), no more than 60 calendar days after receiving a
complaint regarding a licensee, the board must notify the licensee that the board has received a
complaint and inform the licensee of:
   (1) the substance of the complaint;
   (2) the sections of the law that have allegedly been violated;
   (3) the sections of the professional rules that have allegedly been violated; and
   (4) whether an investigation is being conducted.
    (c) The board shall periodically, but no less than every 120 days, notify the licensee of the status
of the complaint consistent with section 13.41.
   (d) Paragraphs (b) and (c) do not apply if the board determines that such notice would
compromise the board's investigation and that such notice cannot reasonably be accomplished
within this time.
   (e) No more than one year after receiving a complaint regarding a licensee, the board must

resolve or dismiss the complaint unless the board determines that resolving or dismissing the
complaint cannot reasonably be accomplished in this time and is not in the public interest.
    (f) Failure to make notifications or to resolve the complaint within the time established in this
subdivision shall not deprive the board of jurisdiction to complete the investigation or to take
corrective, disciplinary, or other action against the licensee that is authorized by law. Such a failure
by the board shall not be the basis for a licensee's request for the board to dismiss a complaint, and
shall not be considered by an administrative law judge, the board, or any reviewing court.
    Subd. 2. Receipt of complaint. The boards shall receive and resolve complaints or other
communications, whether oral or written, against regulated persons. Before resolving an oral
complaint, the executive director or a board member designated by the board to review complaints
m­­
  ay
   ­ shall require the complainant to state the complaint in writing or authorize transcribing the
complaint. The executive director or the designated board member shall determine whether the
complaint alleges or implies a violation of a statute or rule which the board is empowered to
enforce. The executive director or the designated board member may consult with the designee
of the attorney general as to a board's jurisdiction over a complaint. If the executive director or
the designated board member determines that it is necessary, the executive director may seek
additional information to determine whether the complaint is jurisdictional or to clarify the nature
of the allegations by obtaining records or other written material, obtaining a handwriting sample
from the regulated person, clarifying the alleged facts with the complainant, and requesting a
written response from the subject of the complaint.
    Subd. 3. Referral to other agencies. The executive director shall forward to another
governmental agency any complaints received by the board which do not relate to the board's
jurisdiction but which relate to matters within the jurisdiction of another governmental agency.
The agency shall advise the executive director of the disposition of the complaint. A complaint
or other information received by another governmental agency relating to a statute or rule which
a board is empowered to enforce must be forwarded to the executive director of the board to be
processed in accordance with this section. Governmental agencies may coordinate and conduct
joint investigations of complaints that involve more than one governmental agency.
    Subd. 4. Role of the attorney general. The executive director or the designated board member
shall forward a complaint and any additional information to the designee of the attorney general
when the executive director or the designated board member determines that a complaint is
jurisdictional and:
    (1) requires investigation before the executive director or the designated board member may
resolve the complaint;
    (2) that attempts at resolution for disciplinary action or the initiation of a contested case hearing
is appropriate;
   (3) that an agreement for corrective action is warranted; or
   (4) that the complaint should be dismissed, consistent with subdivision 8.
    Subd. 5. Investigation by attorney general. (a) If the executive director or the designated board
member determines that investigation is necessary before resolving the complaint, the executive
director shall forward the complaint and any additional information to the designee of the attorney

general. The designee of the attorney general shall evaluate the communications forwarded and
investigate as appropriate.
   (b) The designee of the attorney general may also investigate any other complaint forwarded
under subdivision 3 when the designee of the attorney general determines that investigation is
necessary.
    (c) In the process of evaluation and investigation, the designee shall consult with or seek the
assistance of the executive director or the designated board member. The designee may also consult
with or seek the assistance of other qualified persons who are not members of the board who the
designee believes will materially aid in the process of evaluation or investigation.
    (d) Upon completion of the investigation, the designee shall forward the investigative report to
the executive director with recommendations for further consideration or dismissal.
     Subd. 6. Attempts at resolution. (a) At any time after receipt of a complaint, the executive
director or the designated board member may attempt to resolve the complaint with the regulated
person. The available means for resolution include a conference or any other written or oral
communication with the regulated person. A conference may be held for the purposes of
investigation, negotiation, education, or conciliation. Neither the executive director nor any
member of a board's staff shall be a voting member in any attempts at resolutions which may result
in disciplinary or corrective action. The results of attempts at resolution with the regulated person
may include a recommendation to the board for disciplinary action, an agreement between the
executive director or the designated board member and the regulated person for corrective action,
or the dismissal of a complaint. If attempts at resolution are not in the public interest o            ­­

director or the designated board member anticipate may result in corrective action. Any agreement
between the executive director or the designated board member and the regulated person for
corrective action shall be in writing and shall be reviewed by the designee of the attorney general
prior to its execution. The agreement for corrective action shall provide for dismissal of the
complaint upon successful completion by the regulated person of the corrective action.

the complaint by disciplinary action or initiate a contested case hearing. Notwithstanding paragraph
(a), clause (2), a board may not take corrective action or dismiss a complaint alleging sexual contact
or sexual conduct with a client unless, in the opinion of the executive director, the designated board
member, and the designee of the attorney general, there is insufficient evidence to justify disciplinary
action.

venture, only if the load is already being served by that privately owned utility.
