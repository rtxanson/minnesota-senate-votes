    Subd. 2. Criteria; measure. (a) Parent Aware must use quality ratings shown to be linked to
improving children's school readiness outcomes and must evaluate, at a minimum, how programs
perform in the following areas:
   (1) family partnerships;
   (2) tracking learning;
   (3) teacher training and education; and
   (4) teaching materials and strategies.
    (b) The commissioner, in coordination with the commissioner of education, must establish and
regularly update the standards and indicators that determine program quality for the quality rating
system. In fiscal year 2012 and later, the commissioner must use the Minnesota quality rating system
tool in use in fiscal year 2011, the results of the evaluations of that quality rating system, and the
recommendations in the report required under section 124D.142.
    (c) Ratings must be indicated using stars. Four stars is the best possible rating. No stars means
the program has not been rated.
     Subd. 3. Rated programs. At least twice each year, beginning June 30, 2012, the contract entity
awarded the contract in subdivision 1 must submit a list of rated programs to the commissioner. The
list of rated programs serves as the commissioner's rating. The commissioner's decision is final.
    Subd. 4. Evaluation. The commissioner shall contract with an independent private organization
to use private funds to evaluate the Parent Aware quality rating system if sufficient private funding
is available. The evaluation must incorporate rating levels and outcome-based data reflecting child
progress toward school readiness. The evaluation must also include recommendations on continued
monitoring and improvement of the correlation between rating levels and outcome-based child
progress toward school readiness. The commissioner shall make available to the independent
private organization any data requested by the organization consistent with chapter 13 and at no
cost to the organization.

programs by eligible program type within a region; (2) the amount of funding available for
scholarships in the region; and (3) the distribution of the population of low-income preschool-aged
children in the region. The commissioner must also designate Hennepin County, the city of St.
Paul, Blue Earth County, and Nicollet County as Parent Aware Plus regions beginning in fiscal
year 2012 and allow those regions to continue using the existing model of the Parent Aware quality
rating system in fiscal year 2012. For the purposes of provider choice under section 119B.09,
