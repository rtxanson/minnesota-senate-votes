kinds of varieties are present in excess of five percent and are named on the label, each that is hybrid
must be designated as hybrid on the label. Any one kind or kind and variety that has pure seed that
is less than 95 percent but more than 75 percent hybrid seed as a result of incompletely controlled
pollination in a cross must be labeled to show the percentage of pure seed that is hybrid seed or a
statement such as "contains from 75 percent to 95 percent hybrid seed." No one kind or variety of
seed may be labeled as hybrid if the pure seed contains less than 75 percent hybrid seed. The word
"hybrid" must be shown on the label in conjunction with the kind.
    (c) Blends must be listed on the label using the term "blend" in conjunction with the kind.
    (d) Mixtures shall be listed on the label using the term "mixture," "mix," or "mixed."
    (e) The label must show a lot number or other lot identification.
    (f) The origin may be omitted from the label.
    (g) The label must show the year for which the seed was packed for sale listed as "packed for
(year)" for seed with a percentage of germination that exceeds the standard last established by the
commissioner, the percentage of germination and the calendar month and year that the percentages
were determined by test, or the calendar month and year the germination test was completed and
the statement "sell by (month and year listed here)," which may be no more than 12 months from
the date of test, exclusive of the month of test.
   (h) For vegetable seeds which germinate less than the standard last established by the
commissioner, the label must show:
    (1) a percentage of germination, exclusive of hard or dormant seed or both;
    (2) a percentage of hard or dormant seed or both, if present; and
   (3) the words "below standard" in not less than eight point type and the month and year the
percentages were determined by test.
    (i) The net weight of the contents or a statement indicating the number of seeds in the container
or both, must appear on either the container or the label,               ­­­x­

    Subd. 8. Flower seeds. For flower and wildflower seeds prepared for use in home gardens or
household plantings, the requirements in paragraphs (a) to (l) apply. Flower and wildflower seeds
packed for sale in commercial quantities to farmers, conservation groups, and other similar entities
are considered agricultural seeds and must be labeled accordingly.
    (a) The label must contain the name of the kind and variety or a statement of type and
performance characteristics as prescribed by rule.
     (b) The percentage that is hybrid must be at least 95 percent of the percentage of pure seed
shown unless the percentage of pure seed which is hybrid seed is shown separately. If two or more
kinds of varieties are present in excess of five percent and are named on the label, each that is hybrid
must be designated as hybrid on the label. Any one kind or kind and variety that has pure seed that

       Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 232.23, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
     Subd. 10. Delivery of grain. ­(­

                                     ) On the redemption of a grain warehouse receipt and payment of
all lawful charges, the grain represented by the receipt is immediately deliverable to the depositor or
the depositor's order, and is not subject to any further charge for storage after demand for delivery
has been made and proper facilities for receiving and shipping the grain have been provided. If
delivery has not commenced within 48 hours after demand has been made and proper facilities have
been provided, the public grain warehouse operator issuing the grain warehouse receipt is liable to
the owner in damages not exceeding two cents per bushel for each day's delay, unless the public
grain warehouse operator makes delivery to different owners in the order demanded as rapidly as it
can be done through ordinary diligence, or unless insolvency has occurred.

source of water supply for nonrestricted recreational impoundments must be disinfected tertiary
recycled water that has been subjected to conventional treatment.
    (b) Disinfected tertiary recycled water that has not received conventional treatment may be used
for nonrestricted recreational impoundments if the recycled water is monitored for the presence of
pathogenic organisms as follows:
    (1) during the first 12 months of operation and use, the recycled water must be sampled and
analyzed monthly for Giardia, enteric viruses, and Cryptosporidium. Following the first 12 months
of use, the recycled water must be sampled and analyzed quarterly for Giardia, enteric viruses, and
Cryptosporidium. The ongoing monitoring may be discontinued after the first two years of operation
with the approval of the commissioner of health; and
    (2) the samples must be taken at a point after disinfection and before the point where the recycled
water enters the use impoundment. The samples must be analyzed by an approved laboratory and
the results submitted quarterly to the commissioner of health.
    (c) The total coliform bacteria concentrations in recycled water used for nonrestricted
recreational impoundments, measured at a point between the disinfection process and the point
of entry to the use impoundment, must comply with the criteria specified in section 115.84,
subdivision 6, clause (2), for disinfected tertiary recycled water.
   (d) Recycled water used as a source of supply for restricted recreational impoundments and for
any publicly accessible impoundments at fish hatcheries must be at least disinfected secondary-2.2
recycled water.
   (e) Recycled water used as a source of supply for landscape impoundments that do not use
decorative fountains must be at least disinfected secondary-23 recycled water.
   Subd. 4. Cooling. (a) Recycled water used for industrial or commercial cooling or air

   (9) commercial car washes, including hand washes if the recycled water is not heated, where the
general public is excluded from the washing process.
   (b) Recycled water used for the following uses must be at least disinfected secondary-23 recycled
water:
   (1) industrial boiler feed;
   (2) nonstructural fire fighting;
   (3) backfill consolidation around nonpotable piping;
   (4) soil compaction;
   (5) mixing concrete;
   (6) dust control on roads and streets;
   (7) cleaning roads, sidewalks, and outdoor work areas; and
   (8) industrial process water that will not come into contact with workers.
   (c) Recycled water used for flushing sanitary sewers must be at least undisinfected secondary
recycled water.
   Sec. 3. [115.86] RECYCLED WATER REQUIREMENTS.
   Subdivision 1. Isolation distances. (a) No irrigation with disinfected tertiary recycled water
shall take place within 50 feet of any water supply well unless:
1578                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [46TH DAY

   (1) a geological investigation demonstrates that an aquitard exists at the well between the
uppermost aquifer being drawn from and the ground surface;
   (2) the well contains an annular seal that extends from the surface into the aquitard;
   (3) the well is housed to prevent any recycled water spray from coming into contact with the
wellhead facilities;
    (4) the ground surface immediately around the wellhead is contoured to allow surface water to
drain away from the well; and
   (5) the owner of the well approves of the elimination of the isolation distance requirement.
    (b) Except as provided under paragraph (a), no irrigation with, or impoundment of, disinfected
tertiary, disinfected secondary-2.2, or disinfected secondary-23 recycled water shall take place
within 150 feet of any water supply well.
    (c) No irrigation with, or impoundment of, undisinfected secondary recycled water shall take
place within 300 feet of any water supply well.
   (d) The isolation distances specified under paragraphs (a) to (c) are doubled when the water
supply well is a sensitive water supply well under rules adopted by the commissioner of health.
   Subd. 2. Use area requirements. (a) Any use of recycled water shall comply with the following:
    (1) any irrigation runoff shall be confined to the recycled water use area, unless the runoff does
not pose a public health threat and is authorized by the commissioner of health;
   (2) spray, mist, or runoff shall not enter dwellings, designated outdoor eating areas, or food
handling facilities; and
    (3) drinking water fountains shall be protected against contact with recycled water spray, mist,
or runoff.

    "WHEREAS, the United States had 22,300,000,000 barrels of economically producible
oil reserves as of December 31, 2009, according to the United States Energy Information
Administration; and
   WHEREAS, the Canadian Oil Sand reserves are second only to those of Saudi Arabia; and
   WHEREAS, dependence on foreign oil imports from unfriendly countries exposes the
United States economy to fluctuations caused by instability in other regions of the world, while
contributing to the foreign trade deficit; and
   WHEREAS, increasing North American oil production and imports would reduce American
dependence on Middle East sources of oil and reduce the foreign trade deficit; and
    WHEREAS, increasing domestic oil production would boost the national economy by
creating jobs and increasing revenues from leases, production, profits, and consumption; NOW,
THEREFORE,
   BE IT RESOLVED by the Legislature of the State of Minnesota that it urges the President, his
administration, and the Congress of the United States to speedily enact legislation that promotes
and removes restrictions to domestic oil drilling and access to Canadian Oil Sand reserves.
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota is directed
to prepare copies of this memorial and transmit them to the President of the United States, the
President and the Secretary of the United States Senate, the Speaker and the Clerk of the United
States House of Representatives, the United States Secretary of State, the chair of the Senate
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the chair of the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce, and Minnesota's Senators and Representatives in Congress."

      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 216B.03, is amended to read:
      216B.03 REASONABLE RATE.
    Every rate made, demanded, or received by any public utility, or by any two or more public
utilities jointly, shall be just and reasonable. Rates shall not be unreasonably preferential,
unreasonably prejudicial, or discriminatory, but shall be sufficient, equitable, and consistent in
application to a class of consumers and among classes of consumers. To the maximum reasonable
extent, the commission shall set rates to encourage energy conservation and renewable energy
use and to further the goals of sections 216B.164, 216B.241, and 216C.05. Any doubt as to
reasonableness should be resolved in favor of the consumer. For rate-making purposes a public
utility may treat two or more municipalities served by it as a single class wherever the populations
are comparable in size or the conditions of service are similar.

    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 216B.07, is amended to read:
    216B.07 RATE PREFERENCE PROHIBITED.
   No public utility shall, as to rates or service, make or grant any unreasonable preference or
advantage to any person or class of consumers or subject any person or class of consumers to any
unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 216B.16, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6e. Revenue allocation among consumer classes. Cost of service shall be the primary
consideration in the commission's determination of revenue allocation among consumer classes.
Factors other than cost of service, including impact on business development and job growth, may
also be considered and evaluated by the commission in determining revenue allocations. Factors
used in determining revenue allocation must be supported by record evidence.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
filings for rate changes filed on and after that date.
    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 216B.16, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7. Energy and emission control products cost adjustment. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this chapter, the commission may permit a public utility to file rate schedules containing
provisions for the automatic adjustment of charges for public utility service in direct relation to
changes in:
    (1) federally regulated wholesale rates for energy delivered through interstate facilities;
    (2) direct costs for natural gas delivered; o
                                                ­­r
    (3) costs for fuel used in generation of electricity or the manufacture of gas; or
    (4) prudent costs incurred by a public utility for sorbents, reagents, or chemicals used to control
emissions from an electric generation facility, provided that these costs are not recovered elsewhere
in rates. The utility must track and report annually the volumes and costs of sorbents, reagents, or
chemicals using separate accounts by generating plant.
    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 216B.16, subdivision 9, is amended to read:

with the commission. For purposes of this subdivision, "low-income residential ratepayers" means
ratepayers who receive energy assistance from the low-income home energy assistance program
(LIHEAP).
   (b) Any affordability program the commission orders a utility to implement must:
    (1) lower the percentage of income that participating low-income households devote to energy
bills;
   (2) increase participating customer payments over time by increasing the frequency of payments;
   (3) decrease or eliminate participating customer arrears;
   (4) lower the utility costs associated with customer account collection activities; and
   (5) coordinate the program with other available low-income bill payment assistance and
conservation resources.
   (c) In ordering affordability programs, the commission may require public utilities to file
program evaluations that measure the effect of the affordability program on:
   (1) the percentage of income that participating households devote to energy bills;
   (2) service disconnections; and
   (3) frequency of customer payments, utility collection costs, arrearages, and bad debt.
    (d) The commission must issue orders necessary to implement, administer, and evaluate
affordability programs, and to allow a utility to recover program costs, including administrative
costs, on a timely basis. The commission may not allow a utility to recover administrative costs,
excluding start-up costs, in excess of five percent of total program costs, or program evaluation
costs in excess of two percent of total program costs. The commission must permit deferred
accounting, with carrying costs, for recovery of program costs incurred during the period between
general rate cases.
   (e) Public utilities may use information collected or created for the purpose of administering
energy assistance to administer affordability programs.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 216B.16, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 19. Multiyear rate plan. (a) A public utility may propose, and the commission may
approve, approve as modified, or reject a multiyear rate plan as provided in this subdivision. The
term "multiyear rate plan" refers to a plan establishing the rates the utility may charge for each year
of the specified period of years to be covered by the plan. The commission may approve a multiyear
rate plan only if it finds that the plan establishes just and reasonable rates for the utility, applying
the factors described in subdivision 6.
    (b) Rates charged under a multiyear rate plan must be based only upon the utility's reasonable and
prudent costs of service over the term of the plan, as determined by the commission, provided that
the costs are not being recovered elsewhere in rates. Rate adjustments authorized under subdivisions
6b and 7 may continue outside of a plan authorized under this subdivision.
   (c) The commission may, by order, establish terms, conditions, and procedures necessary to

implement this subdivision, including a mechanism to periodically examine a multiyear rate plan to
ensure rates charged under the plan remain just and reasonable. In reviewing a multiyear rate plan
proposed in a general rate case under this section, the commission may extend the time requirements
for issuance of a final determination prescribed in this section by an additional 90 days beyond its
existing authority under subdivision 2, paragraph (f).
     Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 216B.1691, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2e. Rate impact of standard compliance; report. Each electric utility must submit to
the commission and the legislative committees with primary jurisdiction over energy policy a report
containing an estimation of the rate impact of activities of the electric utility necessary to comply
with section 216B.1691. The rate impact estimate must be for wholesale rates and, if the electric
utility makes retail sales, the estimate shall also be for the impact on the electric utility's retail rates.
Those activities include, without limitation, energy purchases, generation facility acquisition and
construction, and transmission improvements. An initial report must be submitted within 150 days
of the effective date of this section. After the initial report, a report must be updated and submitted
as part of each integrated resource plan or plan modification filed by the electric utility under section
216B.2422. The reporting obligation of an electric utility under this subdivision expires December
31, 2025, for an electric utility subject to subdivision 2a, paragraph (a), and December 31, 2020, for
an electric utility subject to subdivision 2a, paragraph (b).
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
     Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 216B.2401, is amended to read:
     216B.2401 ENERGY CONSERVATION POLICY GOAL.
    It is the energy policy of the state of Minnesota to achieve annual energy savings equal to

infrastructure and system, and other efforts to promote energy efficiency and energy conservation.
     Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 216B.241, subdivision 1c, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1c. Energy-saving goals. (a) The commissioner shall establish energy-saving goals
for energy conservation improvement expenditures and shall evaluate an energy conservation
improvement program on how well it meets the goals set.
    (b) Each individual utility and association shall have an annual energy-savings goal equivalent
to 1.5 percent of gross annual retail energy sales unless modified by the commissioner under
paragraph (d). The savings goals must be calculated based on the most recent three-year weather
normalized average. A utility or association may elect to carry forward energy savings in excess
of 1.5 percent for a year to the succeeding three calendar years, except that savings from electric
utility infrastructure projects allowed under paragraph (d) may be carried forward for five years. A
particular energy savings can be used only for one year's goal.
   (c) The commissioner must adopt a filing schedule that is designed to have all utilities and
associations operating under an energy-savings plan by calendar year 2010.
46TH DAY]                           MONDAY, MAY 2, 2011                                        1593

    (d) In its energy conservation improvement plan filing, a utility or association may request
the commissioner to adjust its annual energy-savings percentage goal based on its historical
conservation investment experience, customer class makeup, load growth, a conservation potential
study, or other factors the commissioner determines warrants an adjustment. The commissioner
may not approve a plan of a public utility that provides for an annual energy-savings goal of less
than one percent of gross annual retail energy sales from energy conservation improvements.
A utility or association may include in its energy conservation plan energy savings from electric
utility infrastructure projects approved by the commission under section 216B.1636 or waste heat
recovery converted into electricity projects that may count as energy savings in addition to ­h   t­­
                                                                                                    e
a minimum energy-savings goal of at least one percent for energy conservation improvements.
Electric utility infrastructure projects must result in increased energy efficiency greater than that
which would have occurred through normal maintenance activity.
    (e) An energy-savings goal is not satisfied by attaining the revenue expenditure requirements of
subdivisions 1a and 1b, but can only be satisfied by meeting the energy-savings goal established in
this subdivision.
    (f) An association or utility is not required to make energy conservation investments to attain
the energy-savings goals of this subdivision that are not cost-effective even if the investment is
necessary to attain the energy-savings goals. For the purpose of this paragraph, in determining
cost-effectiveness, the commissioner shall consider the costs and benefits to ratepayers, the
utility, participants, and society. In addition, the commissioner shall consider the rate at which an
association or municipal utility is increasing its energy savings and its expenditures on energy
conservation.
    (g) On an annual basis, the commissioner shall produce and make publicly available a report
on the annual energy savings and estimated carbon dioxide reductions achieved by the energy
conservation improvement programs for the two most recent years for which data is available. The
commissioner shall report on program performance both in the aggregate and for each entity filing
an energy conservation improvement plan for approval or review by the commissioner.
    (h) By January 15, 2010, the commissioner shall report to the legislature whether the spending
requirements under subdivisions 1a and 1b are necessary to achieve the energy-savings goals
established in this subdivision.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
energy savings plans for calendar year 2012 and thereafter.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 216B.241, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Programs. (a) The commissioner may require public utilities to make investments
and expenditures in energy conservation improvements, explicitly setting forth the interest rates,
prices, and terms under which the improvements must be offered to the customers. The required
programs must cover no more than a three-year period. Public utilities shall file conservation
improvement plans by June 1, on a schedule determined by order of the commissioner, but at least
every three years. Plans received by a public utility by June 1 must be approved or approved as
modified by the commissioner by December 1 of that same year. The commissioner shall evaluate
the program on the basis of cost-effectiveness and the reliability of technologies employed. The
commissioner's order must provide to the extent practicable for a free choice, by consumers

participating in the program, of the device, method, material, or project constituting the energy
conservation improvement and for a free choice of the seller, installer, or contractor of the energy
conservation improvement, provided that the device, method, material, or project seller, installer,
or contractor is duly licensed, certified, approved, or qualified, including under the residential
conservation services program, where applicable.
   (b) The commissioner may require a utility to make an energy conservation improvement
investment or expenditure whenever the commissioner finds that the improvement will result in
energy savings at a total cost to the utility less than the cost to the utility to produce or purchase an
equivalent amount of new supply of energy. The commissioner shall nevertheless ensure that every
public utility operate one or more programs under periodic review by the department.
    (c) Each public utility subject to subdivision 1a may spend and invest annually up to ten percent
of the total amount required to be spent and invested on energy conservation improvements under
this section by the utility on research and development projects that meet the definition of energy
conservation improvement in subdivision 1 and that are funded directly by the public utility.
    (d) A public utility may not spend for or invest in energy conservation improvements that directly
benefit a large energy facility or a large electric customer facility for which the commissioner has
issued an exemption pursuant to subdivision 1a, paragraph (b). The commissioner shall consider and
may require a utility to undertake a program suggested by an outside source, including a political
subdivision, a nonprofit corporation, or community organization.
    (e) A utility, a political subdivision, or a nonprofit or community organization that has suggested
a program, the attorney general acting on behalf of consumers and small business interests, or a
utility customer that has suggested a program and is not represented by the attorney general under
section 8.33 may petition the commission to modify or revoke a department decision under this
section, and the commission may do so if it determines that the program is not cost-effective, does
not adequately address the residential conservation improvement needs of low-income persons, has
a long-range negative effect on one or more classes of customers, or is otherwise not in the public
interest. The commission shall reject a petition that, on its face, fails to make a reasonable argument
that a program is not in the public interest.
    (f) The commissioner may order a public utility to include, with the filing of the utility's

    Subd. 3. Benefits of weatherization. In the case of any grant made to an owner of a
rental dwelling unit for weatherization, the commissioner must require that (1) the benefits of
weatherization assistance in connection with the dwelling unit accrue primarily to the low-income
family that resides in the unit; (2) the rents on the dwelling unit will not be raised because of
any increase in value due solely to the weatherization assistance; and (3) no undue or excessive
enhancement will occur to the value of the dwelling unit.
