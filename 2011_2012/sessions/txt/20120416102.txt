The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
Dear Madam President:
    I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 158, Senate File 2014, which would alter the terms of
the Metropolitan Council.
    Current terms have been in place since major metropolitan government restructuring was enacted
in 1994. At that time, the Legislature made a carefully considered decision to have Metropolitan
Council members serve terms of office coterminous with that of the Governor. This process has
worked well.
    This legislation would stagger the terms of eight of the Metropolitan Council members. After a
change in administrations, they would continue to serve for two more years. That arrangement would
deny a new Governor the chance to select his or her entire Metropolitan Council until half-way
through the first term.
   Similar legislation was vetoed by then-Governor Pawlenty in 2008. I concur with his veto
message that the Council's current structure "was the result of reforms intended to increase
Metropolitan Council accountability, and this bill reduces that accountability."
                                                   Sincerely,
                                                   Mark Dayton, Governor
   Senator Senjem moved that S.F. No. 2014 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

                                                                                    April 9, 2012

The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
Dear Madam President:
    I am vetoing and returning Chapter 168, Senate File 1236, legislation which fundamentally and
unfairly alters Minnesota's law regarding corporate successor liability. I am convinced that this
legislation will have a broad scope and will set a dangerous precedent for future efforts to shield
corporate defendants from liability.
    Senate File 1236 overturns Minnesota law on corporate successor liability as it relates to gravely
serious asbestos related injuries ­ and inappropriately places the Legislature in the position of both
judge and jury on constitutionally protected remedies.
    The Minnesota Legislature and our Courts have long established rules of liability for corporate
mergers, transfers and acquisitions. The Legislature has been careful to protect the public and injured
parties from corporate gamesmanship and fraudulent transfers created merely to escape liability.
At the same time, our statute and common law provides corporations great flexibility to purchase
business assets without incurring liabilities beyond those acquired by contract.
    Senate File 1236 creates an exception to corporate successor liability that Minnesota and other
Courts have refused to adopt. It is contradictory to define an "innocent successor" as a corporation
that has done nothing wrong and yet subsequently absolve it of its "known" liabilities.
102ND DAY]                          MONDAY, APRIL 16, 2012                                        5851

    Other states have rejected this legislation over well founded objections that providing this
immunity to corporations that merged prior to 1972 will simply increase the financial exposure
of remaining responsible parties, or deny any remedy to asbestos victims in certain cases. This is
unfair to other asbestos defendants, injured Minnesotans, and insurance companies that would all
shoulder a great burden as a result of this legislation. I share this legitimate concern and find such
a result unacceptable.
    The true impact of this legislation should not go without comment. Workplace and other injuries
related to asbestos manufacturing and exposure are staggering. Over 100,000 Americans have fallen
victim to asbestosis and mesothelioma. The cancer causing nature of asbestos has long been known,
and it will continue to claim lives across Minnesota and the country for years to come. I opposed
efforts in the United States Senate to limit exposure of asbestos manufactures and to shift the costs of
these injuries to taxpayers and others. My opposition to Senate File 1236 continues my longstanding
support for victims and their families to be compensated for their suffering from those responsible.
    Minnesotans should expect fairness in the courtroom and demand legislation that does not
change the course of litigation when potential injuries are known to exist. Having met with many
Minnesota families and workers who have suffered from deadly asbestos-related illnesses, I will
not allow that outcome.
   For those reasons I am vetoing this bill.
                                                      Sincerely,
                                                      Mark Dayton, Governor
   Senator Senjem moved that S.F. No. 1236 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.
