2011, chapter 4, section 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. When prepared. Where there is potential for significant environmental effects
resulting from any major governmental action, the action shall be preceded by a detailed
environmental impact statement prepared by the responsible governmental unit. The environmental
impact statement shall be an analytical rather than an encyclopedic document which describes the
proposed action in detail, analyzes its significant environmental impacts, discusses appropriate
alternatives to the proposed action and their impacts, and explores methods by which adverse

environmental impacts of an action could be mitigated. The environmental impact statement shall
also analyze those economic, employment and sociological effects that cannot be avoided should
the action be implemented. To ensure its use in the decision-making process, the environmental
impact statement shall be prepared as early as practical in the formulation of an action. No
mandatory environmental impact statement may be required for an ethanol plant, as defined in
section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), that produces less than 125,000,000 gallons of
ethanol annually and is located outside of the seven-county metropolitan area.
    (a) The board shall by rule establish categories of actions for which environmental impact
statements and for which environmental assessment worksheets shall be prepared as well as
categories of actions for which no environmental review is required under this section. A mandatory
environmental assessment worksheet shall not be required for the construction or expansion of an
ethanol plant, as defined in section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), based on the capacity of
the new or expanded facility to produce ethanol, but must be required if the ethanol facility meets
or exceeds thresholds of other categories of actions for which environmental worksheets must be
prepared.
    (b) The responsible governmental unit shall promptly publish notice of the completion of
an environmental assessment worksheet in a manner to be determined by the board and shall
provide copies of the environmental assessment worksheet to the board and its member agencies.
Comments on the need for an environmental impact statement may be submitted to the responsible
governmental unit during a 30-day period following publication of the notice that an environmental
assessment worksheet has been completed. The responsible governmental unit's decision on the
need for an environmental impact statement shall be based on the environmental assessment
worksheet and the comments received during the comment period, and shall be made within 15
days after the close of the comment period. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not
more than 15 additional days upon the request of the responsible governmental unit.
    (c) An environmental assessment worksheet shall also be prepared for a proposed action
whenever material evidence accompanying a petition by not less than 25 individuals, submitted
before the proposed project has received final approval by the appropriate governmental units,
demonstrates that, because of the nature or location of a proposed action, there may be potential
for significant environmental effects. Petitions requesting the preparation of an environmental
assessment worksheet shall be submitted to the board. The chair of the board shall determine the
appropriate responsible governmental unit and forward the petition to it. A decision on the need
for an environmental assessment worksheet shall be made by the responsible governmental unit
within 15 days after the petition is received by the responsible governmental unit. The board's chair
may extend the 15-day period by not more than 15 additional days upon request of the responsible
governmental unit.
   (d) Except in an environmentally sensitive location where Minnesota Rules, part 4410.4300,
subpart 29, item B, applies, the proposed action is exempt from environmental review under this
chapter and rules of the board, if:
   (1) the proposed action is:
   (i) an animal feedlot facility with a capacity of less than 1,000 animal units; or
   (ii) an expansion of an existing animal feedlot facility with a total cumulative capacity of less
than 1,000 animal units;

    (2) the application for the animal feedlot facility includes a written commitment by the proposer
to design, construct, and operate the facility in full compliance with Pollution Control Agency
feedlot rules; and
    (3) the county board holds a public meeting for citizen input at least ten business days prior
to the Pollution Control Agency or county issuing a feedlot permit for the animal feedlot facility
unless another public meeting for citizen input has been held with regard to the feedlot facility to be
permitted. The exemption in this paragraph is in addition to other exemptions provided under other
law and rules of the board.
    (e) The board may, prior to final approval of a proposed project, require preparation of an
environmental assessment worksheet by a responsible governmental unit selected by the board for
any action where environmental review under this section has not been specifically provided for by
rule or otherwise initiated.
    (f) An early and open process shall be utilized to limit the scope of the environmental impact
statement to a discussion of those impacts, which, because of the nature or location of the project,
have the potential for significant environmental effects. The same process shall be utilized to
determine the form, content and level of detail of the statement as well as the alternatives which
are appropriate for consideration in the statement. In addition, the permits which will be required
for the proposed action shall be identified during the scoping process. Further, the process shall
identify those permits for which information will be developed concurrently with the environmental
impact statement. The board shall provide in its rules for the expeditious completion of the scoping
process. The determinations reached in the process shall be incorporated into the order requiring
the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (g) The responsible governmental unit shall, to the extent practicable, avoid duplication and
ensure coordination between state and federal environmental review and between environmental
review and environmental permitting. Whenever practical, information needed by a governmental
unit for making final decisions on permits or other actions required for a proposed project shall be
developed in conjunction with the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (h) An environmental impact statement shall be prepared and its adequacy determined within
280 days after notice of its preparation unless the time is extended by consent of the parties or
by the governor for good cause. The responsible governmental unit shall determine the adequacy
of an environmental impact statement, unless within 60 days after notice is published that an
environmental impact statement will be prepared, the board chooses to determine the adequacy of
an environmental impact statement. If an environmental impact statement is found to be inadequate,
the responsible governmental unit shall have 60 days to prepare an adequate environmental impact
statement.
    (i) The proposer of a specific action may include in the information submitted to the responsible
governmental unit a preliminary draft environmental impact statement under this section on
that action for review, modification, and determination of completeness and adequacy by the
responsible governmental unit. A preliminary draft environmental impact statement prepared by
the project proposer and submitted to the responsible governmental unit shall identify or include as
an appendix all studies and other sources of information used to substantiate the analysis contained
in the preliminary draft environmental impact statement. The responsible governmental unit shall
require additional studies, if needed, and obtain from the project proposer all additional studies and

or responsible parties must be able to identify the recipient's needs, direct and evaluate task
accomplishment, and provide for health and safety. Approved hours may be used outside the home
when normal life activities take them outside the home. To use personal care assistance services
at school, the recipient or responsible party must provide written authorization in the care plan
identifying the chosen provider and the daily amount of services to be used at school. Total hours
for services, whether actually performed inside or outside the recipient's home, cannot exceed that
which is otherwise allowed for personal care assistance services in an in-home setting according
to sections 256B.0651 to 256B.0656. Medical assistance does not cover personal care assistance
services for residents of a hospital, nursing facility, intermediate care facility, health care facility
licensed by the commissioner of health, or unless a resident who is otherwise eligible is on leave
from the facility and the facility either pays for the personal care assistance services or forgoes the
facility per diem for the leave days that personal care assistance services are used. All personal
care assistance services must be provided according to sections 256B.0651 to 256B.0656. Personal
care assistance services may not be reimbursed if the personal care assistant is the spouse or paid
guardian of the recipient or the parent of a recipient under age 18, or the responsible party or the
family foster care provider of a recipient who cannot direct the recipient's own care unless, in the
case of a foster care provider, a county or state case manager visits the recipient as needed, but
not less than every six months, to monitor the health and safety of the recipient and to ensure
the goals of the care plan are met. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 256B.0659, the
unpaid guardian or conservator of an adult, who is not the responsible party and not the personal
care provider organization, may be reimbursed to provide personal care assistance services to the
recipient if the guardian or conservator meets all criteria for a personal care assistant according to
section 256B.0659, and shall not be considered to have a service provider interest for purposes of
participation on the screening team under section 256B.092, subdivision 7.
     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0652, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Authorization; personal care assistance and qualified professional. (a) All personal
care assistance services, supervision by a qualified professional, and additional services beyond the
limits established in subdivision 11, must be authorized by the commissioner or the commissioner's
designee before services begin except for the assessments established in subdivision 11 and section
256B.0911. The authorization for personal care assistance and qualified professional services under
section 256B.0659 must be completed within 30 days after receiving a complete request.
    (b) The amount of personal care assistance services authorized must be based on the
recipient's home care rating. The home care rating shall be determined by the commissioner or
the commissioner's designee based on information submitted to the commissioner identifying the
following for recipients with dependencies in two or more activities of daily living:
26TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2011                                         537

   (1) total number of dependencies of activities of daily living as defined in section 256B.0659;
   (2) presence of complex health-related needs as defined in section 256B.0659; and
   (3) presence of Level I behavior as defined in section 256B.0659.
    (c) For persons meeting the criteria in paragraph (b), the methodology to determine total time
for personal care assistance services for each home care rating is based on the median paid units per
day for each home care rating from fiscal year 2007 data for the personal care assistance program.
Each home care rating has a base level of hours assigned. Additional time is added through the
assessment and identification of the following:
    (1) 30 additional minutes per day for a dependency in each critical activity of daily living as
defined in section 256B.0659;
   (2) 30 additional minutes per day for each complex health-related function as defined in section
256B.0659; and
   (3) 30 additional minutes per day for each behavior issue as defined in section 256B.0659,
subdivision 4, paragraph (d).
    (d) Effective July 1, 2011, the home care rating for recipients who have a dependency in one
activity of daily living or level one behavior shall equal no more than two units per day.
    (e) A limit of 96 units of qualified professional supervision may be authorized for each recipient
receiving personal care assistance services. A request to the commissioner to exceed this total in a
calendar year must be requested by the personal care provider agency on a form approved by the
commissioner."
  And when so amended the bill do pass and be re-referred to the Committee on Finance.
