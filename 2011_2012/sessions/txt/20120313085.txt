all applicable provisions of this chapter, chapter 152, and Minnesota Rules, chapter 6800, must be
followed.
    Subd. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this section only, the terms defined in this subdivision have
the meanings given.
    (a) "Automated drug distribution system" or "system" means a mechanical system approved by
the board that performs operations or activities, other than compounding or administration, related
to the storage, packaging, or dispensing of drugs, and collects, controls, and maintains all required
transaction information and records.
    (b) "Health care facility" means a nursing home licensed under section 144A.02; a housing with
services establishment registered under section 144D.01, subdivision 4, that provides centralized

responsible for the operation of an automated drug distribution system.
    Subd. 3. Authorization. A pharmacy may use an automated drug distribution system to fill
prescription drug orders for patients of a health care facility. The automated drug distribution
system may be located in a health care facility that is not at the same location as the managing
pharmacy. When located within a health care facility, the system is considered to be an extension
of the managing pharmacy.
    Subd. 4. Notification. (a) At least 60 days prior to the initial use of an automated drug distribution
system, the managing pharmacy must provide the board with written notification of the address at
which the automated drug distribution system will be located, the manufacturer and model of the
automated drug distribution system, and written policies and procedures that govern the operation of
the system. The policies and procedures must address the requirements of subdivision 5 and the rules

of the board. If the managing pharmacy will be using a system identical to the one for which it has
previously provided notification to the board, and will be using identical policies and procedures, it
must notify the board of the address at which the automated drug distribution system will be located
and the manufacturer and model of the automated drug distribution system at least seven days in
advance of using the system.
    (b) The managing pharmacy must notify the board whenever an automated drug distribution
system is taken permanently out of service.
    (c) The managing pharmacy must notify the board whenever an automated drug distribution
system is replaced. It must also provide the board with new written policies and procedures, unless
an identical system is used as the replacement, 60 days prior to the replacement of the system.
    Subd. 5. Operation of automated drug distribution systems. (a) The managing pharmacy and
the pharmacist in charge are responsible for the operation of an automated drug distribution system.
    (b) Access to an automated drug distribution system must be limited to pharmacy and
nonpharmacy personnel authorized to procure drugs from the system, except that field service
technicians may access a system located in a health care facility for the purposes of servicing
and maintaining it while being monitored either by the managing pharmacy, or a licensed nurse
within the health care facility. In the case of an automated drug distribution system that is not
physically located within a licensed pharmacy, access for the purpose of procuring drugs shall
be limited to licensed nurses. Each person authorized to access the system must be assigned an
individual specific access code. Alternatively, access to the system may be controlled through the
use of biometric identification procedures. A policy specifying time access parameters, including
time-outs, log-offs, and lock-outs, must be in place.

following clauses are met:

and approve all prescription drug orders before any drug is distributed from the system to be

orders provided that a pharmacist certifies the accuracy of the data entry before the drug can be
released from the automated drug distribution system. A pharmacist must certify the accuracy of
the filling of any cassettes, canisters, or other containers that contain drugs that will be loaded into
the automated drug distribution system; and
    (2) when the automated drug dispensing system is located and used within the managing
pharmacy, a pharmacist must personally supervise and take responsibility for all packaging and
labeling associated with the use of an automated drug distribution system.
    (d) Access to drugs when a pharmacist has not reviewed and approved the prescription drug
order is permitted only when a formal and written decision to allow such access is issued by the
pharmacy and the therapeutics committee or its equivalent. The committee must specify the patient
care circumstances in which such access is allowed, the drugs that can be accessed, and the staff
that are allowed to access the drugs.
    (e) The loading of a automated drug dispensing system located in a health care facility may be
performed by a pharmacy technician, so long as the activity is continuously supervised, through a

two-way audiovisual system by a pharmacist on duty within the managing pharmacy.
    (f) The automated drug distribution system must be under the supervision of a pharmacist. The
pharmacist is not required to be physically present at the site of the automated drug distribution
system if the system is continuously monitored electronically by the managing pharmacy. A
pharmacist on duty within the managing pharmacy must be continuously available to address

The secretary of state shall determine if any of the persons in the report is registered to vote and
shall prepare a list of those registrants for the county auditor. The county auditor shall change the
status on the record in the statewide registration system of any individual named in the report to
indicate that the individual is not eligible to reregister or vote.
    (b) The secretary of state shall report, at least annually, to the chairs and ranking minority
members of the house of representatives and senate committees with oversight over elections on
the number of individuals in each county whose registration status is changed pursuant to this

    (a) An individual seeking to vote shall sign a polling place roster which states that the individual
is at least 18 years of age, a citizen of the United States, has resided in Minnesota for 20 days
immediately preceding the election, maintains residence at the address shown, is not under a
guardianship, is not under a limited guardianship in which the court order revokes the individual's
right to vote, has not been found by a court of law to be legally incompetent to vote or has the right
to vote because, if the individual was convicted of a felony, the felony sentence has expired or
been completed or the individual has been discharged from the sentence, is registered and has not
already voted in the election. The roster must also state: "I understand that deliberately providing
false information is a felony punishable by not more than five years imprisonment and a fine of
not more than $10,000, or both."
    (b) A judge may, before the applicant signs the roster, confirm the applicant's name, address, and
date of birth.
    (c) After the applicant signs the roster, the judge shall give the applicant a voter's receipt. The
voter shall deliver the voter's receipt to the judge in charge of ballots as proof of the voter's right
to vote, and thereupon the judge shall hand to the voter the ballot. The voters' receipts must be
maintained during the time for notice of filing an election contest.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 524.5-120, is amended to read:
   524.5-120 BILL OF RIGHTS FOR WARDS AND PROTECTED PERSONS.
    The ward or protected person retains all rights not restricted by court order and these rights must

    (9) personal privacy;
    (10) communication and visitation with persons of the ward's or protected person's choice,

    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 524.5-310, is amended to read:
    524.5-310 FINDINGS; ORDER OF APPOINTMENT.
    (a) The court may appoint a limited or unlimited guardian for a respondent only if it finds by
clear and convincing evidence that:
    (1) the respondent is an incapacitated person; and
    (2) the respondent's identified needs cannot be met by less restrictive means, including use of

appropriate technological assistance.
   (b) Alternatively, the court, with appropriate findings, may treat the petition as one for
a protective order under section 524.5-401, enter any other appropriate order, or dismiss the
proceeding.
    (c) The court shall grant to a guardian only those powers necessitated by the ward's limitations
and demonstrated needs and, whenever feasible, make appointive and other orders that will
encourage the development of the ward's maximum self-reliance and independence. Any power
not specifically granted to the guardian, following a written finding by the court of a demonstrated
need for that power, is retained by the ward. In making an order, the court shall explicitly declare
whether the order establishes a guardianship or a limited guardianship and, in the case of a limited
guardianship, the effect of the order on the ward's right to vote.
    (d) If the court grants the guardian any of the powers or duties under section 524.5-313,
paragraph (c), clause (1), (2), or (4), the authority of a previously appointed health care agent to
make health care decisions, as defined in section 145C.01, subdivision 5, is suspended until further
order of the court or as otherwise provided by this section. The court may declare a health care
directive unenforceable as provided in section 145C.09, subdivision 3. The court may declare that
a health care directive has been revoked by the ward if the court finds, by clear and convincing
evidence, that the ward has revoked the health care directive as provided in section 145C.09,
subdivision 1.
    (e) A health care agent or other person legally appointed by the ward to control final disposition
of the ward's remains under section 145C.05, subdivision 2, clause (7), or 149A.80, or a health care
agent authorized to make organ or tissue donations under section 525A.04 or 525A.09, may make
health care decisions as defined in section 145C.01, subdivision 5, on behalf of the ward for the
purpose of preparing the ward's body for organ or tissue donation or final disposition of the ward's
remains, as applicable.
    (f) Within 14 days after an appointment, a guardian shall send or deliver to the ward, and counsel
if represented at the hearing, a copy of the order of appointment accompanied by a notice which
advises the ward of the right to appeal the guardianship appointment in the time and manner provided
by the Rules of Appellate Procedure.
    (g) Each year, within 30 days after the anniversary date of an appointment, a guardian shall send
or deliver to the ward and to interested persons of record with the court a notice of the right to request
termination or modification of the guardianship or to request an order that is in the best interests of
the ward or for other appropriate relief, and notice of the status of the ward's right to vote.
    (h) Within 14 days after an appointment, a guardian shall send, by certified mail, a copy of the
order of appointment to the ward's current residential address. The mailing must be addressed to the
ward and, if applicable, the administrator or other responsible person at the facility in which the ward
resides. If a ward's residential address changes, the guardian must send a new copy of the original
order of appointment and, if applicable, any modification to the order made by the court to the new
residential address by certified mail within 30 days of the change of address. The requirements of
this paragraph do not apply if the guardian resides at the same address as the ward.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 524.5-313, is amended to read:

   524.5-313 POWERS AND DUTIES OF GUARDIAN.
    (a) A guardian shall be subject to the control and direction of the court at all times and in all
things.
   (b) The court shall grant to a guardian only those powers necessary to provide for the
demonstrated needs of the ward.
    (c) The court may appoint a guardian if it determines that all the powers and duties listed in this
section are needed to provide for the needs of the incapacitated person. The court may also appoint
a guardian if it determines that a guardian is needed to provide for the needs of the incapacitated
person through the exercise of some, but not all, of the powers and duties listed in this section. The
duties and powers of a guardian or those which the court may grant to a guardian include, but are
not limited to:
    (1) the power to have custody of the ward and the power to establish a place of abode within
or outside the state, except as otherwise provided in this clause. The ward or any interested person
may petition the court to prevent or to initiate a change in abode. A ward may not be admitted to a
regional treatment center by the guardian except:
   (i) after a hearing under chapter 253B;
   (ii) for outpatient services; or
   (iii) for the purpose of receiving temporary care for a specific period of time not to exceed 90
days in any calendar year;
    (2) the duty to provide for the ward's care, comfort, and maintenance needs, including food,
clothing, shelter, health care, social and recreational requirements, and, whenever appropriate,
training, education, and habilitation or rehabilitation. The guardian has no duty to pay for these
requirements out of personal funds. Whenever possible and appropriate, the guardian should meet
these requirements through governmental benefits or services to which the ward is entitled, rather
than from the ward's estate. Failure to satisfy the needs and requirements of this clause shall be
grounds for removal of a private guardian, but the guardian shall have no personal or monetary
liability;
    (3) the duty to take reasonable care of the ward's clothing, furniture, vehicles, and other personal
effects, and, if other property requires protection, the power to seek appointment of a conservator
of the estate. The guardian must give notice by mail to interested persons prior to the disposition of
the ward's clothing, furniture, vehicles, or other personal effects. The notice must inform the person
of the right to object to the disposition of the property within ten days of the date of mailing and
to petition the court for a review of the guardian's proposed actions. Notice of the objection must
be served by mail or personal service on the guardian and the ward unless the ward is the objector.
The guardian served with notice of an objection to the disposition of the property may not dispose
of the property unless the court approves the disposition after a hearing;
    (4)(i) the power to give any necessary consent to enable the ward to receive necessary medical
or other professional care, counsel, treatment, or service, except that no guardian may give consent
for psychosurgery, electroshock, sterilization, or experimental treatment of any kind unless the
procedure is first approved by order of the court as provided in this clause. The guardian shall not
consent to any medical care for the ward which violates the known conscientious, religious, or

moral belief of the ward;
    (ii) a guardian who believes a procedure described in item (i) requiring prior court approval to
be necessary for the proper care of the ward, shall petition the court for an order and, in the case of a
public guardianship under chapter 252A, obtain the written recommendation of the commissioner of
human services. The court shall fix the time and place for the hearing and shall give notice to the ward
in such manner as specified in section 524.5-308 and to interested persons. The court shall appoint
an attorney to represent the ward who is not represented by counsel, provided that such appointment
shall expire upon the expiration of the appeal time for the order issued by the court under this section
or the order dismissing a petition, or upon such other time or event as the court may direct. In every
case the court shall determine if the procedure is in the best interest of the ward. In making its
determination, the court shall consider a written medical report which specifically considers the
medical risks of the procedure, whether alternative, less restrictive methods of treatment could be
used to protect the best interest of the ward, and any recommendation of the commissioner of human
services for a public ward. The standard of proof is that of clear and convincing evidence;
    (iii) in the case of a petition for sterilization of a developmentally disabled ward, the court
shall appoint a licensed physician, a psychologist who is qualified in the diagnosis and treatment
of developmental disability, and a social worker who is familiar with the ward's social history
and adjustment or the case manager for the ward to examine or evaluate the ward and to provide
written reports to the court. The reports shall indicate why sterilization is being proposed, whether
sterilization is necessary and is the least intrusive method for alleviating the problem presented,
and whether it is in the best interest of the ward. The medical report shall specifically consider the
medical risks of sterilization, the consequences of not performing the sterilization, and whether
alternative methods of contraception could be used to protect the best interest of the ward;
    (iv) any ward whose right to consent to a sterilization has not been restricted under this section
or section 252A.101 may be sterilized only if the ward consents in writing or there is a sworn
acknowledgment by an interested person of a nonwritten consent by the ward. The consent must
certify that the ward has received a full explanation from a physician or registered nurse of the
nature and irreversible consequences of the sterilization;
    (v) a guardian or the public guardian's designee who acts within the scope of authority conferred
by letters of guardianship under section 252A.101, subdivision 7, and according to the standards
established in this chapter or in chapter 252A shall not be civilly or criminally liable for the provision
of any necessary medical care, including, but not limited to, the administration of psychotropic
medication or the implementation of aversive and deprivation procedures to which the guardian or
the public guardian's designee has consented;
   (5) in the event there is no duly appointed conservator of the ward's estate, the guardian shall
have the power to approve or withhold approval of any contract, except for necessities, which the
ward may make or wish to make;
    (6) the duty and power to exercise supervisory authority over the ward in a manner which limits
civil rights and restricts personal freedom only to the extent necessary to provide needed care and
services;
   (7) if there is no acting conservator of the estate for the ward, the guardian has the power to
apply on behalf of the ward for any assistance, services, or benefits available to the ward through
any unit of government;

Minnesota Constitution, article VII, an individual placed under a guardianship shall not be entitled

   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 524.5-316, is amended to read:
   524.5-316 REPORTS; MONITORING OF GUARDIANSHIP; COURT ORDERS.
    Subdivision 1. Annual report of guardian. (a) A guardian shall report to the court in writing on
the condition of the ward at least annually and whenever ordered by the court. A copy of the report
must be provided to the ward and to interested persons of record with the court. A report must state
or contain:
   (1) the current mental, physical, and social condition of the ward;
   (2) the living arrangements for all addresses of the ward during the reporting period;
    (3) any restrictions placed on the ward's right to communication and visitation with persons of
the ward's choice and the factual bases for those restrictions;
   (4) the medical, educational, vocational, and other services provided to the ward and the
guardian's opinion as to the adequacy of the ward's care;
    (5) a recommendation as to the need for continued guardianship and any recommended changes
in the scope of the guardianship, including whether, in the view of the guardian, the ward's eligibility
to vote should be rescinded, restored, or continue unchanged;
   (6) an address and telephone number where the guardian can be contacted;
   (7) whether the guardian has ever been removed for cause from serving as a guardian or
conservator and, if so, the case number and court location;
    (8) any changes occurring that would affect the accuracy of information contained in the most
recent criminal background study of the guardian conducted under section 524.5-118; and
    (9) if applicable, the amount of reimbursement for services rendered to the ward that the guardian
received during the previous year that were not reimbursed by county contract.
    (b) A ward or interested person of record with the court may submit to the court a written
statement disputing statements or conclusions regarding the condition of the ward that are contained
in the report and may petition the court for an order that is in the best interests of the ward or for
other appropriate relief.
    (c) An interested person may notify the court in writing that the interested person does not wish
to receive copies of reports required under this section.
   (d) The court may appoint a visitor to review a report, interview the ward or guardian, and make
any other investigation the court directs.
    (e) The court shall establish a system for monitoring guardianships, including the filing and
review of annual reports. If an annual report is not filed within 60 days of the required date, the
court shall issue an order to show cause.
85TH DAY]                         TUESDAY, MARCH 13, 2012                                        4341

    Subd. 2. Annual review; ward's capacity to vote. (a) If the well-being report of a limited
guardian under subdivision 1 indicates a change in conditions affecting a ward's capacity to make
independent voting decisions at an election, the court may issue a written order as to the ward's
eligibility to vote. If the court makes a determination regarding a ward's capacity or incapacity to
vote, the court must consider the limited guardian's recommendation, any documents submitted in
the annual well-being report, and previous court orders and records related to the ward's capacity
as evidence of the ward's capacity or incapacity to make independent voting decisions, and must
affirmatively order that the ward's eligibility to vote is rescinded, restored, or continues unchanged,
provided that the right to vote may not be rescinded without a hearing. An order by the court under
this paragraph may be modified by the court at any time. A copy of the written order shall be sent
to the guardian within 30 days of the date it is issued.
   (b) The limited guardian shall send, by certified mail, a copy of the court order or notification
made by the court under this subdivision to the ward's current residential address within 30
days after it is made or the order is received. The mailing must be addressed to the ward and, if
applicable, the administrator or other responsible person at the facility in which the ward resides. If
a ward's residential address changes, the guardian shall send a new copy of the court's most recent
order by certified mail to the new residential address within 30 days of the change of address. The
requirements of this paragraph do not apply if the guardian resides at the same address as the ward.
    (c) Following a determination made by the court under paragraph (a), the guardian must inform
the ward of the ward's current voting eligibility status.
   Sec. 10. [524.5-318] DUTIES OF FACILITIES PROVIDING HOUSING TO A WARD.
