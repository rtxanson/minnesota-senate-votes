SERVICES.
     A policy of individual or group health and accident insurance regulated under this chapter, or
individual or group subscriber contract regulated under chapter 62C, health maintenance contract
regulated under chapter 62D, or health benefit certificate regulated under chapter 64B, issued,
renewed, or continued to provide coverage to a Minnesota resident, must provide coverage for
child health supervision services and prenatal care services. The policy, contract, or certificate
must specifically exempt reasonable and customary charges for child health supervision services
and prenatal care services from a deductible, co-payment, or other coinsurance or dollar limitation
requirement. Nothing in this section prohibits a health plan company that has a network of providers
from imposing a deductible, co-payment, or other coinsurance or dollar limitation requirement for
child health supervision services and prenatal care services that are delivered by an out-of-network
provider. This section does not prohibit the use of policy waiting periods or preexisting condition
limitations for these services. Minimum benefits may be limited to one visit payable to one provider
for all of the services provided at each visit cited in this section subject to the schedule set forth
in this section. N   ­o­­h

using reasonable medical management techniques to determine the frequency, method, treatment,
or setting for child health supervision services and prenatal care services.
    "Child health supervision services" means pediatric preventive services, appropriate
immunizations, developmental assessments, and laboratory services appropriate to the age of a
child from birth to age six, and appropriate immunizations from ages six to 18, as defined by
Standards of Child Health Care issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Reimbursement
must be made for at least five child health supervision visits from birth to 12 months, three child
health supervision visits from 12 months to 24 months, once a year from 24 months to 72 months.
   "Prenatal care services" means the comprehensive package of medical and psychosocial
support provided throughout the pregnancy, including risk assessment, serial surveillance,
prenatal education, and use of specialized skills and technology, when needed, as defined by
Standards for Obstetric-Gynecologic Services issued by the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists.
     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 62A.21, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Continuation privilege. Every policy described in subdivision 1 shall contain a
provision which permits continuation of coverage under the policy for the insured's former spouse
and dependent children upon entry of a valid decree of dissolution of marriage. The coverage shall
be continued until the earlier of the following dates:
     (a) the date the insured's former spouse becomes covered under any other group health plan; or
     (b) the date coverage would otherwise terminate under the policy.
    If the coverage is provided under a group policy, any required premium contributions for the
coverage shall be paid by the insured on a monthly basis to the group policyholder for remittance to
the insurer. The policy must require the group policyholder to, upon request, provide the insured with
written verification from the insurer of the cost of this coverage promptly at the time of eligibility

required premium amount for continuation of the coverage shall be calculated in the same manner
as provided under section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code, its implementing regulations and
Internal Revenue Service rulings on section 4980B.
    Upon request by the insured's former spouse or dependent child, a health carrier must provide
the instructions necessary to enable the child or former spouse to elect continuation of coverage."
     Page 2, after line 19, insert:
     "Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 62D.101, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Continuation privilege. Every health maintenance contract as described in
subdivision 1 shall contain a provision which permits continuation of coverage under the contract
for the enrollee's former spouse and children upon entry of a valid decree of dissolution of marriage.
The coverage shall be continued until the earlier of the following dates:
     (a) the date the enrollee's former spouse becomes covered under another group plan or Medicare;
or
     (b) the date coverage would otherwise terminate under the health maintenance contract.
     If coverage is provided under a group policy, any required premium contributions for the
coverage shall be paid by the enrollee on a monthly basis to the group contract holder to be paid to
the health maintenance organization. The contract must require the group contract holder to, upon
request, provide the enrollee with written verification from the insurer of the cost of this coverage
promptly at the time of eligibility for this coverage and at any time during the continuation period.

reporting.

eligibility for nurse licensure, nothing in this section shall preclude the board from considering
an applicant's conviction of a crime that is not listed in subdivision 9 or public records from a
juvenile delinquency proceeding where there has been a judicial determination that the elements of
an offense occurred.
     Subd. 12. Order of denial. When an applicant is denied licensure based on conviction of a crime
listed in subdivision 9, and following an opportunity to challenge the accuracy and completeness
of the criminal history report, the board may issue a public order of denial and is not required to
provide the applicant a hearing prior to denying licensure.
    Subd. 13. Reconsideration of denial. (a) An applicant denied licensure based on a conviction of
a crime listed in subdivision 9, clauses (1) to (21), may not request reconsideration of the denial of
licensure and may not reapply for licensure by the board until ten years following absolute discharge
from sentence, or unless the applicant has received a court order of expungement of the record
or a pardon of conviction. Absolute discharge from sentence means completion of any sentence,
including imprisonment, probation, parole, community service, and any form of court supervision.
    (b) An applicant denied licensure based on a conviction of a crime listed in subdivision 9,
clauses (22) to (54), may request reconsideration of the board's decision to deny licensure. The

whether to grant a license to the previously denied applicant:
   (1) the number of crimes for which the applicant has been convicted;
    (2) the nature and seriousness of the crimes and vulnerability of the victims of the crimes,
including whether the commission of the crimes involved the abuse of trust or the exploitation of a
unique position or knowledge;
   (3) the relationship between the crimes and the practice of nursing;
   (4) the age of the applicant at the time the crimes were committed;
    (5) the amount of time that has elapsed since the crimes occurred and since the completion of
the terms of any sentence imposed;

and attorneys for the purpose of evaluating an applicant's eligibility or qualification for licensure.
    Subd. 15. Current licensees. The board may request that a licensee who is the subject of an
investigation by the board submit to a criminal background check if there is reason to believe the
licensee has been charged with or convicted of a crime in this or any other jurisdiction.
    Subd. 16. Instructions to the board; plan. The board shall collaborate with the Minnesota
Department of Human Services and the BCA to establish a plan for completing criminal background
checks of all licensees who were licensed before the effective date of this section. The plan for
background checks of current licensees shall be developed no later than 2017 and may be contingent
upon the BCA's implementation of a system in which any new crimes that an applicant or licensee
commits after an initial background check are flagged in the BCA's database and reported back to
the board. The plan shall include recommendations for any necessary statutory changes and shall
seek to minimize duplication of requirements for background studies.
