and the preservation and dedication of streets and land for other public purposes and the general
design of physical improvement.
    (b) A county must approve a preliminary plat that meets the applicable standards and criteria
contained in the county's zoning and subdivision regulations unless the county adopts written
findings based on a record from the public proceedings why the application shall not be approved.
   (c) The controls may require that a portion of any proposed subdivision be dedicated to the
public or preserved for public use as parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, or
open space. The requirement must be imposed by ordinance.
   (d) If a county adopts the ordinance required by paragraph (c), the county must adopt a capital
improvement program and adopt a parks and open space plan or have a parks, trails, and open space
component in its comprehensive plan subject to the terms and conditions in this paragraph and in
paragraphs (e) through (p).
    (e) The county may choose to accept a per lot cash fee as set by ordinance from the applicant
for some or all of the new lots created in the subdivision.
   (f) In establishing the portion to be dedicated or preserved or the per lot cash fee, the controls
must consider the open space, park, recreational, or common areas and facilities that the applicant
proposes to reserve for the subdivision.
   (g) The county must reasonably determine that it will need to acquire that portion of land for the
purposes stated in this subdivision as a result of approval of the subdivision.

    (i) Any cash payments received must be placed by the county in a special fund to be used only

recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, or open space.
   (k) The county must not deny the approval of a subdivision based on an inadequate supply of
parks, open spaces, trails, or recreational areas within the county.
    (l) The county must not condition the approval of any proposed subdivision or development on
an agreement to waive the right to challenge the validity of a fee or dedication.
    (m) The county must use at least 75 percent of the funds collected under this subdivision
according to the plan required in paragraph (d) in the township or city where the collection of
funds occurs. However, the township board or city council may agree to allow the county to
use these funds outside of the township or city in a manner consistent with the county parks,
trails, and open space capital improvement plan or the county parks and open space component

and trails connectivity and accessibility purposes. The county must annually report to cities and
townships on where funds were collected and where funds were expended in the past year.
    (n) Previously subdivided property from which a park dedication has been received, being
resubdivided with the same number of lots, is exempt from park dedication requirements. If, as a
result of resubdividing the property, the number of lots is increased, then the park dedication or per
lot cash fee must apply only to the net increase of lots.
    (o) A county must not require a dedication of a portion of a proposed subdivision or a payment in
lieu of dedication in a town or city that has adopted a requirement to dedicate or a payment in place
of dedication as a provision of the town or city's subdivision regulations under section 462.358,

    (b) Before adopting an interim zoning ordinance or map, the county board must hold a public
hearing. Notice of the public hearing must be published in the county's official newspaper at least
ten days before the hearing.
    (c) An interim ordinance or map must not halt, delay, or impede consideration of a use,
development, or subdivision for which a complete application under section 15.99 is pending

to be conducted or has held or has scheduled a hearing for the purpose of considering adoption or
amendment of a comprehensive plan or official controls as defined in section 462.352, subdivision
15, or if new territory for which plans or controls have not been adopted is annexed to a municipality,

      ) (d) The period of an interim ordinance applicable to an area that is affected by a city's
master plan for a municipal airport may be extended for such additional periods as the municipality
may deem appropriate, not exceeding a total additional period of 18 months. In all other cases,
no interim ordinance may halt, delay, or impede a subdivision that has been given preliminary
approval, nor may any interim ordinance extend the time deadline for agency action set forth in
section 15.99 with respect to any application filed prior to the effective date of the interim ordinance.
The governing body of the municipality may extend the interim ordinance after a public hearing and
written findings have been adopted based upon one or more of the conditions in clause (1), (2), or
(3). The public hearing must be held at least 15 days but not more than 30 days before the expiration
of the interim ordinance, and notice of the hearing must be published at least ten days before the
hearing. The interim ordinance may be extended for the following conditions and durations, but,
except as provided in clause (3), an interim ordinance may not be extended more than an additional
18 months:
    (1) up to an additional 120 days following the receipt of the final approval or review by a federal,
state, or metropolitan agency when the approval is required by law and the review or approval has
not been completed and received by the municipality at least 30 days before the expiration of the
interim ordinance;
    (2) up to an additional 120 days following the completion of any other process required by a
state statute, federal law, or court order, when the process is not completed at least 30 days before
the expiration of the interim ordinance; or
    (3) up to an additional one year if the municipality has not adopted a comprehensive plan under
this section at the time the interim ordinance is enacted.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 462.358, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Terms of regulations. (a) The standards and requirements in the regulations may
address without limitation: the size, location, grading, and improvement of lots, structures, public
areas, streets, roads, trails, walkways, curbs and gutters, water supply, storm drainage, lighting,
sewers, electricity, gas, and other utilities; the planning and design of sites; access to solar energy;
and the protection and conservation of flood plains, shore lands, soils, water, vegetation, energy,

air quality, and geologic and ecologic features. The regulations shall require that subdivisions be
consistent with the municipality's official map if one exists and its zoning ordinance, and may
require consistency with other official controls and the comprehensive plan. The regulations may
prohibit certain classes or kinds of subdivisions in areas where prohibition is consistent with the
comprehensive plan and the purposes of this section, particularly the preservation of agricultural
lands. The regulations may prohibit, restrict or control development for the purpose of protecting and
assuring access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems. The regulations may prohibit the issuance
of permits or approvals for any tracts, lots, or parcels for which required subdivision approval has
not been obtained.
   (b) The regulations may permit the municipality to condition its approval on the construction
and installation of sewers, streets, electric, gas, drainage, and water facilities, and similar utilities
and improvements or, in lieu thereof, on the receipt by the municipality of a cash deposit, certified
check, irrevocable letter of credit, bond, or other financial security in an amount and with surety
and conditions sufficient to assure the municipality that the utilities and improvements will be
constructed or installed according to the specifications of the municipality. Sections 471.345 and
574.26 do not apply to improvements made by a subdivider or a subdivider's contractor.
    (c) A municipality may require that an applicant establish an escrow account or other financial
security for the purpose of reimbursing the municipality for direct costs relating to professional
services provided during the review, approval and inspection of the project. A municipality may only
charge the applicant a rate equal to the value of the service to the municipality. Services provided
by municipal staff or contract professionals must be billed at an established rate.
    (d) When the applicant vouches, by certified letter to the municipality, that the conditions
required by the municipality for approval under this subdivision have been satisfied, the
municipality has 30 days to release and return to the applicant any and all financial securities tied
to the requirements. If the municipality fails to release and return the letters of credit within the
30-day period, any interest accrued will be paid to the applicant. If the municipality determines that
the conditions required for approval under this subdivision have not been satisfied, the municipality
must send written notice within seven business days upon receipt of the certified letter indicating
to the applicant which specific conditions have not been met. The municipality shall require a
maintenance or performance bond from any subcontractor that has not yet completed all remaining
requirements of the municipality.
    (e) The regulations may permit the municipality to condition its approval on compliance
with other requirements reasonably related to the provisions of the regulations and to execute
development contracts embodying the terms and conditions of approval. The municipality may
not require land dedications or fees in the development contract that are not authorized by statute
or mutually agreed upon by all parties to the development contract. In addition, the amount
of financial security for work authorized under the development contract must have a rough
proportionality to the work to be completed by either the municipality or the applicant. Unless
otherwise agreed, at least three days before approval, the municipality must provide a copy of
the complete development contract, including all exhibits, to the applicant. The municipality may
enforce such agreements and conditions by appropriate legal and equitable remedies.
