a percentage of its licensees for compliance with continuing education requirements.
   (b) The board shall mail a notice to a licensee selected for an audit of continuing education hours.
The notice must include the reporting periods selected for audit.
   (c) Selected licensees shall submit copies of the original documentation of completed continuing
education hours. Upon specific request, the licensee shall submit original documentation. Failure to
submit required documentation shall result in the renewal application being considered incomplete
and void and constitute grounds for nonrenewal of the license and disciplinary action.
   Subd. 8. Variance of continuing education requirements. (a) If a licensee is unable to meet
5512                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [98TH DAY

the continuing education requirements by the renewal date, the licensee may request a time-limited
variance to fulfill the requirements after the renewal date. A licensee seeking a variance is considered
to be renewing late and is subject to the late renewal fee, regardless of when the request is received
or whether the variance is granted.
    (b) The licensee shall submit the variance request on a form designated by the board, include
the variance fee subject to section 14.056, subdivision 2, and the late fee for license renewal under
section 148F.115. The variance request is subject to the criteria for rule variances in section 14.055,
subdivision 4, and must include a written plan listing the activities offered to meet the requirement.
Hours completed after the renewal date pursuant to the written plan count toward meeting only the
requirements of the previous renewal period.
    (c) A variance granted under this subdivision expires six months after the license renewal date.
A licensee who is granted a variance but fails to complete the required continuing education within
the six-month period may apply for a second variance according to this subdivision.
    (d) If an initial variance request is denied, the license of the licensee shall not be renewed until the
licensee completes the continuing education requirements. If an initial variance is granted, and the
licensee fails to complete the required continuing education within the six-month period, the license
shall be administratively suspended until the licensee completes the required continuing education,
unless the licensee has obtained a second variance according to paragraph (c).

   Sec. 19. [148F.090] DENIAL, SUSPENSION, OR REVOCATION OF LICENSE.
    Subdivision 1. Grounds. The board may impose disciplinary action as described in subdivision
2 against an applicant or licensee whom the board, by a preponderance of the evidence, determines:
   (1) has violated a statute, rule, or order that the board issued or is empowered to enforce;
    (2) has engaged in fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest conduct, whether or not the conduct relates
to the practice of licensed alcohol and drug counseling that adversely affects the person's ability or
fitness to practice alcohol and drug counseling;
    (3) has engaged in unprofessional conduct or any other conduct which has the potential for
causing harm to the public, including any departure from or failure to conform to the minimum
standards of acceptable and prevailing practice without actual injury having to be established;
    (4) has been convicted of or has pled guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or gross misdemeanor
reasonably related to the provision of alcohol and drug counseling services, or has been shown to

engaged in conduct reflecting adversely on the applicant's or licensee's ability or fitness to engage
in the practice of alcohol and drug counseling;
   (5) has employed fraud or deception in obtaining or renewing a license, or in passing an
examination;
   (6) has had any license, certificate, registration, privilege to take an examination, or other similar
authority denied, revoked, suspended, canceled, limited, or not renewed for cause in any jurisdiction
5514                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [98TH DAY

or has surrendered or voluntarily terminated a license or certificate during a board investigation of
a complaint, as part of a disciplinary order, or while under a disciplinary order;
   (7) has failed to meet any requirement for the issuance or renewal of the person's license. The
burden of proof is on the applicant or licensee to demonstrate the qualifications or satisfy the
requirements for a license under this chapter;
   (8) has failed to cooperate with an investigation by the board;
    (9) has demonstrated an inability to practice alcohol and drug counseling with reasonable skill
and safety as a result of illness, use of alcohol, drugs, chemicals, or any other materials, or as a result
of any mental, physical, or psychological condition;
    (10) has engaged in conduct with a client that is sexual or may reasonably be interpreted by the
client as sexual, or in any verbal behavior that is seductive or sexually demeaning to a client;
    (11) has been subject to a corrective action or similar, nondisciplinary action in another
jurisdiction or by another regulatory authority;
    (12) has been adjudicated as mentally incompetent, mentally ill, or developmentally disabled or
as a chemically dependent person, a person dangerous to the public, a sexually dangerous person,
or a person who has a sexual psychopathic personality by a court of competent jurisdiction within
this state or an equivalent adjudication from another state. Adjudication automatically suspends a
license for the duration thereof unless the board orders otherwise;
   (13) fails to comply with a client's request for health records made under sections 144.291 to
144.298, or to furnish a client record or report required by law;
  (14) has engaged in abusive or fraudulent billing practices, including violations of the federal
Medicare and Medicaid laws or state medical assistance laws; or
    (15) has engaged in fee splitting. This clause does not apply to the distribution of revenues
from a partnership, group practice, nonprofit corporation, or professional corporation to its partners,
shareholders, members, or employees if the revenues consist only of fees for services performed by
the licensee or under a licensee's administrative authority. Fee splitting includes, but is not limited
to:
   (i) dividing fees with another person or a professional corporation, unless the division is in
proportion to the services provided and the responsibility assumed by each professional;
   (ii) referring a client to any health care provider as defined in sections 144.291 to 144.298 in
which the referring licensee has a significant financial interest, unless the licensee has disclosed in

   (iii) paying, offering to pay, receiving, or agreeing to receive a commission, rebate, or
remuneration, directly or indirectly, primarily for the referral of clients.
    Subd. 2. Forms of disciplinary action. If grounds for disciplinary action exist under subdivision
1, the board may take one or more of the following actions:
   (1) refuse to grant or renew a license;
98TH DAY]                            MONDAY, APRIL 2, 2012                                        5515

   (2) revoke a license;
   (3) suspend a license;
    (4) impose limitations or conditions on a licensee's practice of alcohol and drug counseling,
including, but not limited to, limiting the scope of practice to designated competencies, imposing
retraining or rehabilitation requirements, requiring the licensee to practice under supervision,
or conditioning continued practice on the demonstration of knowledge or skill by appropriate
examination or other review of skill and competence;
   (5) censure or reprimand the licensee;
    (6) impose a civil penalty not exceeding $10,000 for each separate violation, the amount of the
civil penalty to be fixed so as to deprive the applicant or licensee of any economic advantage gained
by reason of the violation charged, to discourage similar violations or to reimburse the board for
the cost of the investigation and proceeding, including, but not limited to, fees paid for services
provided by the Office of Administrative Hearings, legal and investigative services provided by the
Office of the Attorney General, court reporters, witnesses, reproduction of records, board members'
per diem compensation, board staff time, and travel costs and expenses incurred by board staff and
board members; or
   (7) any other action justified by the case.
    Subd. 3. Evidence. In disciplinary actions alleging violations of subdivision 1, clause (4), (12),
or (14), a copy of the judgment or proceedings under the seal of the court administrator or of the
administrative agency that entered the judgment or proceeding is admissible into evidence without
further authentication and constitutes prima facie evidence of its contents.
    Subd. 4. Temporary suspension. (a) In addition to any other remedy provided by law, the board
may issue an order to temporarily suspend the credentials of a licensee after conducting a preliminary
inquiry to determine if the board reasonably believes that the licensee has violated a statute or rule
that the board is empowered to enforce and whether continued practice by the licensee would create
an imminent risk of harm to others.
   (b) The order may prohibit the licensee from engaging in the practice of alcohol and drug
counseling in whole or in part and may condition the end of a suspension on the licensee's
compliance with a statute, rule, or order that the board has issued or is empowered to enforce.
    (c) The order shall give notice of the right to a hearing according to this subdivision and shall
state the reasons for the entry of the order.
    (d) Service of the order is effective when the order is served on the licensee personally or by
certified mail, which is complete upon receipt, refusal, or return for nondelivery to the most recent
address of the licensee provided to the board.
    (e) At the time the board issues a temporary suspension order, the board shall schedule a hearing
to be held before its own members. The hearing shall begin no later than 60 days after issuance of the
temporary suspension order or within 15 working days of the date of the board's receipt of a request
for hearing by a licensee, on the sole issue of whether there is a reasonable basis to continue, modify,
or lift the temporary suspension. The hearing is not subject to chapter 14. Evidence presented by the
board or the licensee shall be in affidavit form only. The licensee or counsel of record may appear
5516                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [98TH DAY

for oral argument.
    (f) Within five working days of the hearing, the board shall issue its order and, if the suspension
is continued, schedule a contested case hearing within 30 days of the issuance of the order.
Notwithstanding chapter 14, the administrative law judge shall issue a report within 30 days after
closing the contested case hearing record. The board shall issue a final order within 30 days of
receipt of the administrative law judge's report.
   Subd. 5. Automatic suspension. (a) The right to practice is automatically suspended when:
    (1) a guardian of an alcohol and drug counselor is appointed by order of a district court under
sections 524.5-101 to 524.5-502; or
   (2) the counselor is committed by order of a district court under chapter 253B.
   (b) The right to practice remains suspended until the counselor is restored to capacity by a court
and, upon petition by the counselor, the suspension is terminated by the board after a hearing or
upon agreement between the board and the counselor.
    Subd. 6. Mental, physical, or chemical health evaluation. (a) If the board has probable cause
to believe that an applicant or licensee is unable to practice alcohol and drug counseling with
reasonable skill and safety due to a mental or physical illness or condition, the board may direct the
individual to submit to a mental, physical, or chemical dependency examination or evaluation.
    (1) For the purposes of this section, every licensee and applicant is deemed to have consented
to submit to a mental, physical, or chemical dependency examination or evaluation when directed
in writing by the board and to have waived all objections to the admissibility of the examining
professionals' testimony or examination reports on the grounds that the testimony or examination
reports constitute a privileged communication.
    (2) Failure of a licensee or applicant to submit to an examination when directed by the board
constitutes an admission of the allegations against the person, unless the failure was due to
circumstances beyond the person's control, in which case a default and final order may be entered
without the taking of testimony or presentation of evidence.
    (3) A licensee or applicant affected under this subdivision shall at reasonable intervals be given
an opportunity to demonstrate that the licensee or applicant can resume the competent practice of
licensed alcohol and drug counseling with reasonable skill and safety to the public.
    (4) In any proceeding under this subdivision, neither the record of proceedings nor the orders
entered by the board shall be used against the licensee or applicant in any other proceeding.
    (b) In addition to ordering a physical or mental examination, the board may, notwithstanding
section 13.384 or sections 144.291 to 144.298, or any other law limiting access to medical or other
health data, obtain medical data and health records relating to a licensee or applicant without the
licensee's or applicant's consent if the board has probable cause to believe that subdivision 1, clause
(9), applies to the licensee or applicant. The medical data may be requested from:
   (1) a provider, as defined in section 144.291, subdivision 2, paragraph (h);
   (2) an insurance company; or
98TH DAY]                             MONDAY, APRIL 2, 2012                                           5517

   (3) a government agency, including the Department of Human Services.
    (c) A provider, insurance company, or government agency must comply with any written request
of the board under this subdivision and is not liable in any action for damages for releasing the data
requested by the board if the data are released pursuant to a written request under this subdivision,
unless the information is false and the provider giving the information knew, or had reason to believe,
the information was false.
    (d) Information obtained under this subdivision is private data on individuals as defined in
section 13.02, subdivision 12.
   Sec. 20. [148F.095] ADDITIONAL REMEDIES.
    Subdivision 1. Cease and desist. (a) The board may issue a cease and desist order to stop a
person from violating or threatening to violate a statute, rule, or order which the board has issued or
has authority to enforce. The cease and desist order must state the reason for its issuance and give
notice of the person's right to request a hearing under sections 14.57 to 14.62. If, within 15 days of
service of the order, the subject of the order fails to request a hearing in writing, the order is the final
order of the board and is not reviewable by a court or agency.
    (b) A hearing must be initiated by the board not later than 30 days from the date of the board's
receipt of a written hearing request. Within 30 days of receipt of the administrative law judge's
report, and any written agreement or exceptions filed by the parties, the board shall issue a final
order modifying, vacating, or making permanent the cease and desist order as the facts require. The
final order remains in effect until modified or vacated by the board.
    (c) When a request for a stay accompanies a timely hearing request, the board may, in the board's
discretion, grant the stay. If the board does not grant a requested stay, the board shall refer the
request to the Office of Administrative Hearings within three working days of receipt of the request.
Within ten days after receiving the request from the board, an administrative law judge shall issue a
recommendation to grant or deny the stay. The board shall grant or deny the stay within five working
days of receiving the administrative law judge's recommendation.
   (d) In the event of noncompliance with a cease and desist order, the board may institute a
proceeding in district court to obtain injunctive relief or other appropriate relief, including a civil
penalty payable to the board, not to exceed $10,000 for each separate violation.
    Subd. 2. Injunctive relief. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, including the
issuance of a cease and desist order under subdivision 1, the board may in the board's own name
bring an action in district court for injunctive relief to restrain an alcohol and drug counselor from
a violation or threatened violation of any statute, rule, or order which the board has authority to
administer, enforce, or issue.
    Subd. 3. Additional powers. The issuance of a cease and desist order or injunctive relief granted
under this section does not relieve a counselor from criminal prosecution by a competent authority
or from disciplinary action by the board.

    An alcohol and drug counselor who is the subject of an investigation, or who is questioned

government institution, by agencies, or research facilities, may represent themselves by the titles
designated by that organization provided the title does not indicate the individual is licensed by the
board.
   Subd. 3. Penalty. A person who violates sections 148F.001 to 148F.205 is guilty of a
misdemeanor.
   Sec. 23. [148F.110] EXCEPTIONS TO LICENSE REQUIREMENT.

themselves out to the public by any title or description stating or implying that they are engaged in
the practice of alcohol and drug counseling, or that they are licensed to engage in the practice of
alcohol and drug counseling, unless that person is also licensed as an alcohol and drug counselor.
Persons engaged in the practice of alcohol and drug counseling are not exempt from the board's
jurisdiction solely by the use of one of the titles in paragraph (a).
    Subd. 2. Students. Nothing in sections 148F.001 to 148F.110 shall prevent students enrolled

counseling.

professional conduct of alcohol and drug counselors is measured.

work setting conflict with any provision in sections 148F.120 to 148F.205, the provider shall discuss

information may be disclosed to others only according to section 148F.135, or with certain
exceptions as specified in subdivisions 2 to 13.
    Subd. 2. Duty to warn; limitation on liability. Private information may be disclosed without
the consent of the client when a duty to warn arises, or as otherwise provided by law or court order.
The duty to warn of, or take reasonable precautions to provide protection from, violent behavior
arises only when a client or other person has communicated to the provider a specific, serious threat
of physical violence to self or a specific, clearly identified or identifiable potential victim. If a duty
to warn arises, the duty is discharged by the provider if reasonable efforts are made to communicate
the threat to law enforcement agencies, the potential victim, the family of the client, or appropriate
third parties who are in a position to prevent or avert the harm. No monetary liability and no cause of
action or disciplinary action by the board may arise against a provider for disclosure of confidences
to third parties, for failure to disclose confidences to third parties, or for erroneous disclosure of
confidences to third parties in a good faith effort to warn against or take precautions against a client's
violent behavior or threat of suicide.
    Subd. 3. Services to group clients. Whenever alcohol and drug counseling services are provided
to group clients, the provider shall initially inform each client of the provider's responsibility and
each client's individual responsibility to treat any information gained in the course of rendering the
services as private information, including any limitations to each client's right to privacy.
    Subd. 4. Obtaining collateral information. Prior to obtaining collateral information about a
client from other individuals, the provider shall obtain consent from the client unless the consent
is not required by law or court order, and shall inform the other individuals that the information
obtained may become part of the client's records and may therefore be accessed or released by
the client, unless prohibited by law. For purposes of this subdivision, "other individual" means
any individual, except for credentialed health care providers acting in their professional capacities,
who participates adjunctively in the provision of services to a client. Examples of other individuals
include, but are not limited to, family members, friends, coworkers, day care workers, guardians ad
litem, foster parents, or school personnel.
    Subd. 5. Minor clients. At the beginning of a professional relationship, the provider shall inform
a minor client that the law imposes limitations on the right of privacy of the minor with respect to
the minor's communications with the provider. This requirement is waived when the minor cannot
reasonably be expected to understand the privacy statement.
   Subd. 6. Limited access to client records. The provider shall limit access to client records.

The provider shall make reasonable efforts to inform individuals associated with the provider's
agency or facility, such as staff members, students, volunteers, or community aides, that access
to client records, regardless of their format, is limited only to the provider with whom the client has
a professional relationship, an individual associated with the agency or facility whose duties require

reports or other clinical materials used in teaching, presentations, professional meetings, or
publications.
  Subd. 9. Observation and recording. Diagnostic interviews or therapeutic sessions with a client
may be observed or electronically recorded only with the client's written informed consent.
    Subd. 10. Continued protection of client information. The provider shall maintain the privacy
of client data indefinitely after the professional relationship has ended.
    Subd. 11. Court-ordered or other mandated disclosures. The proper disclosure of private
client data upon a court order or to conform with state or federal law shall not be considered a
violation of sections 148F.120 to 148F.205.
   Subd. 12. Abuse or neglect of minors or vulnerable adults. An applicant or licensee must
comply with the reporting of maltreatment of minors established in section 626.556 and the reporting
of maltreatment of vulnerable adults established in section 626.557.
    Subd. 13. Initial contacts. When an individual initially contacts a provider regarding alcohol
and drug counseling services, the provider or another individual designated by the provider may,
with oral consent from the potential client, contact third parties to determine payment or benefits
information, arrange for precertification of services when required by the individual's health plan,

redacted unless written authorization to disclose this information has been obtained from the other
clients.
    Subd. 4. Board investigation. The board shall be allowed access to any records of a client

   S.F. No. 1880: A bill for an act relating to counties; providing a process for making certain
county offices appointive in Dodge County and Clay County.
   Senator Gimse moved to amend S.F. No. 1880 as follows:
   Page 4, after line 31, insert:
   "Sec. 3. KANDIYOHI COUNTY OFFICES MAY BE APPOINTED.
    Subdivision 1. Authority to make office appointive. Notwithstanding Minnesota Statutes,
section 382.01, upon adoption of a resolution by the Kandiyohi County Board of Commissioners,
the offices of county recorder and auditor-treasurer are not elective but must be filled by
appointment by the county board as provided in the resolution.
    Subd. 2. Board controls; may change as long as duties done. Upon adoption of a resolution
by the county board of commissioners and subject to subdivisions 3 and 4, the duties required by
statute of an elected official whose office is made appointive as authorized by this section must be
discharged by the county board of commissioners acting through a department head appointed by
the board for that purpose. Reorganization, reallocation, delegation, or other administrative change
or transfer does not diminish, prohibit, or avoid the discharge of duties required by statute.
    Subd. 3. Incumbents to complete term. The person elected at the last general election to
an office made appointive under this section must serve in that capacity and perform the duties,
functions, and responsibilities required by statute until the completion of the term of office to which
the person was elected or until a vacancy occurs in the office, whichever occurs earlier.

to provide for the appointment of the county recorder or auditor-treasurer, the county board must
publish a proposed resolution notifying the public of its intent to consider the issue once each week
for two consecutive weeks in the official publication of the county. Following publication and prior
to formally adopting the resolution, the county board shall provide an opportunity at its next regular
meeting for public comment relating to the issue. After the public comment opportunity, at the same
meeting or a subsequent meeting, the county board of commissioners may adopt a resolution that
provides for the appointment of the county recorder or auditor-treasurer as permitted in this section.
The resolution must be approved by at least 80 percent of the members of the county board. The
resolution may take effect 60 days after it is adopted, or at a later date stated in the resolution, unless
a petition is filed as provided in paragraph (b).
    (b) Within 60 days after the county board adopts the resolution, a petition requesting a
referendum may be filed with the county auditor-treasurer. The petition must be signed by at least
ten percent of the registered voters of the county. The petition must meet the requirements of the
secretary of state, as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 204B.071, and any rules adopted to
implement that section. If the petition is sufficient, the question of appointing the county recorder
or auditor-treasurer must be placed on the ballot at a regular or special election. If a majority of
the voters of the county voting on the question vote in favor of appointment, the resolution may
be implemented.
    Subd. 5. Reverting to elected offices. (a) The county board may adopt a resolution to provide
for the election of an office made an appointed position under this section, but not until at least three
years after the office was made an appointed position. The county board must publish a proposed
resolution notifying the public of its intent to consider the issue once each week for two consecutive
weeks in the official publication of the county. Following publication and before formally adopting
the resolution, the county board must provide an opportunity at its next regular meeting for public
comment relating to the issue. After the public comment hearing, the county board may adopt the
resolution. The resolution must be approved by at least 60 percent of the members of the county
board and is effective August 1 following adoption of the resolution.
    (b) The question of whether an office made an appointed position under this section must be
made an elected office must be placed on the ballot at the next general election if (1) the position
has been an appointed position for at least three years, (2) a petition signed by at least ten percent of
the registered voters of the county is filed with the office of the county auditor-treasurer by August
1 of the year in which the general election is held, and (3) the petition meets the requirements of
the secretary of state, as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 204B.071, and any rules adopted
to implement that section. If a majority of the voters of the county voting on the question vote in
favor of making the office an elected position, the election for that office must be held at the next
regular or special election.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day after the Kandiyohi County Board of
Commissioners and its chief clerical officer timely complete their compliance with Minnesota
Statutes, section 645.021, subdivisions 2 and 3."

who has not previously participated in or completed a diversion program authorized under section
401.065 or who has not previously been placed on probation without a judgment of guilty and
thereafter been discharged from probation under this section is found guilty of a violation of section

determines that the violation does not qualify as a subsequent controlled substance conviction under
section 152.01, subdivision 16a, the court may, without entering a judgment of guilty and with
the consent of the person, defer further proceedings and place the person on probation upon such
reasonable conditions as it may require and for a period, not to exceed the maximum sentence
provided for the violation. The court may give the person the opportunity to attend and participate

adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided. The court may, in its discretion, dismiss
the proceedings against the person and discharge the person from probation before the expiration
of the maximum period prescribed for the person's probation. If during the period of probation the
person does not violate any of the conditions of the probation, then upon expiration of the period
the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against that person. Discharge and
dismissal under this subdivision shall be without court adjudication of guilt, but a not public record
of it shall be retained by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension for the purpose of use by the courts in
determining the merits of subsequent proceedings against the person. The not public record may also
be opened only upon court order for purposes of a criminal investigation, prosecution, or sentencing.
Upon request by law enforcement, prosecution, or corrections authorities, the bureau shall notify the
requesting party of the existence of the not public record and the right to seek a court order to open
it pursuant to this section. The court shall forward a record of any discharge and dismissal under
this subdivision to the bureau which shall make and maintain the not public record of it as provided
