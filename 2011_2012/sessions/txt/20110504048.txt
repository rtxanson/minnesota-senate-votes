of Juvenile Protection Procedure. The motion shall be brought in an existing juvenile protection
proceeding and may be brought by any party, a putative father, or the county attorney representing
the responsible social services agency.
    (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, a motion to establish parentage under this
section, and any related documents or orders, are not confidential and are accessible to the public

been adjudicated under the Minnesota Parentage Act or if a recognition of parentage has been fully
executed and filed under section 257.75 when the recognition of parentage has the force and effect
of a judgment or order determining the existence of the parent and child relationship under section

    (b) The social services agency shall determine whether a child brought to its attention for the
purposes described in this section is an Indian child, as defined in section 260C.007, subdivision 21,
and shall determine the identity of the Indian child's tribe, as defined in section 260.755, subdivision
9. When a child to be evaluated is an Indian child, the team provided in paragraph (a) shall include
a designated representative of the Indian child's tribe, unless the child's tribal authority declines to
appoint a representative. The Indian child's tribe may delegate its authority to represent the child to
any other federally recognized Indian tribe, as defined in section 260.755, subdivision 12.
    (c) If the court, prior to, or as part of, a final disposition, proposes to place a child:
    (1) for the primary purpose of treatment for an emotional disturbance, a developmental disability,
or chemical dependency in a residential treatment facility out of state or in one which is within the
state and licensed by the commissioner of human services under chapter 245A; or
    (2) in any out-of-home setting potentially exceeding 30 days in duration, including a
postdispositional placement in a facility licensed by the commissioner of corrections or human
services, the court shall ascertain whether the child is an Indian child and shall notify the county
welfare agency and, if the child is an Indian child, shall notify the Indian child's tribe. The
county's juvenile treatment screening team must either: (i) screen and evaluate the child and file its
recommendations with the court within 14 days of receipt of the notice; or (ii) elect not to screen a
given case and notify the court of that decision within three working days.

facility within the state;
    (2) the screening team has evaluated the child and recommended that a residential placement
is necessary to meet the child's treatment needs and the safety needs of the community, that it is a
cost-effective means of meeting the treatment needs, and that it will be of therapeutic value to the
child; or

to the contrary that a residential placement is necessary. The court shall state the reasons for
its determination in writing, on the record, and shall respond specifically to the findings and
recommendation of the screening team in explaining why the recommendation was rejected. The
attorney representing the child and the prosecuting attorney shall be afforded an opportunity to be
heard on the matter.
    (e) When the county's juvenile treatment screening team has elected to screen and evaluate a
child determined to be an Indian child, the team shall provide notice to the tribe or tribes that
accept jurisdiction for the Indian child or that recognize the child as a member of the tribe or as
a person eligible for membership in the tribe, and permit the tribe's representative to participate in

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256.01, subdivision 14b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 14b. American Indian child welfare projects. (a) The commissioner of human services
may authorize projects to test tribal delivery of child welfare services to American Indian children
and their parents and custodians living on the reservation. The commissioner has authority to
solicit and determine which tribes may participate in a project. Grants may be issued to Minnesota
Indian tribes to support the projects. The commissioner may waive existing state rules as needed
to accomplish the projects. Notwithstanding section 626.556, the commissioner may authorize
projects to use alternative methods of investigating and assessing reports of child maltreatment,
provided that the projects comply with the provisions of section 626.556 dealing with the rights
of individuals who are subjects of reports or investigations, including notice and appeal rights
and data practices requirements. The commissioner may seek any federal approvals necessary to
carry out the projects as well as seek and use any funds available to the commissioner, including
use of federal funds, foundation funds, existing grant funds, and other funds. The commissioner
is authorized to advance state funds as necessary to operate the projects. Federal reimbursement
applicable to the projects is appropriated to the commissioner for the purposes of the projects.
The projects must be required to address responsibility for safety, permanency, and well-being of
children.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, "American Indian child" means a person under ­   18
                                                                                            ­­y

 g­e 21 years old and who is a tribal member or eligible for membership in one of the tribes chosen
for a project under this subdivision and who is residing on the reservation of that tribe.
   (c) In order to qualify for an American Indian child welfare project, a tribe must:
   (1) be one of the existing tribes with reservation land in Minnesota;
   (2) have a tribal court with jurisdiction over child custody proceedings;
48TH DAY]                            WEDNESDAY, MAY 4, 2011                                       1721

   (3) have a substantial number of children for whom determinations of maltreatment have
occurred;
      (4) have capacity to respond to reports of abuse and neglect under section 626.556;
      (5) provide a wide range of services to families in need of child welfare services; and
      (6) have a tribal-state title IV-E agreement in effect.
   (d) Grants awarded under this section may be used for the nonfederal costs of providing child
welfare services to American Indian children on the tribe's reservation, including costs associated
with:
      (1) assessment and prevention of child abuse and neglect;
      (2) family preservation;
      (3) facilitative, supportive, and reunification services;
      (4) out-of-home placement for children removed from the home for child protective purposes;
and
    (5) other activities and services approved by the commissioner that further the goals of providing
safety, permanency, and well-being of American Indian children.
    (e) When a tribe has initiated a project and has been approved by the commissioner to assume
child welfare responsibilities for American Indian children of that tribe under this section, the
affected county social service agency is relieved of responsibility for responding to reports of
abuse and neglect under section 626.556 for those children during the time within which the tribal
project is in effect and funded. The commissioner shall work with tribes and affected counties to
develop procedures for data collection, evaluation, and clarification of ongoing role and financial
responsibilities of the county and tribe for child welfare services prior to initiation of the project.
Children who have not been identified by the tribe as participating in the project shall remain the
responsibility of the county. Nothing in this section shall alter responsibilities of the county for law
enforcement or court services.
    (f) Participating tribes may conduct children's mental health screenings under section 245.4874,
subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (14), for children who are eligible for the initiative and living
on the reservation and who meet one of the following criteria:
      (1) the child must be receiving child protective services;
      (2) the child must be in foster care; or
      (3) the child's parents must have had parental rights suspended or terminated.
Tribes may access reimbursement from available state funds for conducting the screenings. Nothing
in this section shall alter responsibilities of the county for providing services under section 245.487.
    (g) Participating tribes may establish a local child mortality review panel. In establishing a local
child mortality review panel, the tribe agrees to conduct local child mortality reviews for child deaths
or near-fatalities occurring on the reservation under subdivision 12. Tribes with established child
mortality review panels shall have access to nonpublic data and shall protect nonpublic data under
1722                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                      [48TH DAY

subdivision 12, paragraphs (c) to (e). The tribe shall provide written notice to the commissioner and
affected counties when a local child mortality review panel has been established and shall provide
data upon request of the commissioner for purposes of sharing nonpublic data with members of the
state child mortality review panel in connection to an individual case.
    (h) The commissioner shall collect information on outcomes relating to child safety, permanency,
and well-being of American Indian children who are served in the projects. Participating tribes must
provide information to the state in a format and completeness deemed acceptable by the state to meet
state and federal reporting requirements.

information immediately available and make a determination as to the subject's immediate risk of
harm to persons served by the program where the individual studied will have direct contact with,

    (b) The commissioner shall consider all relevant information available, including the following
factors in determining the immediate risk of harm:
   (1) the recency of the disqualifying characteristic;

from the program.

limited to a specific individual who is receiving services. For new background studies required
under section 245C.04, subdivision 1, paragraph (i), if an individual's disqualification was
previously set aside for the license holder's program and the new background study results in no
new information that indicates the individual may pose a risk of harm to persons receiving services
from the license holder, the previous set aside shall remain in effect.
    (b) If the commissioner previously set aside an individual's disqualification for one or more
programs or agencies, and the individual is the subject of a subsequent background study for a
different program or agency, the commissioner shall determine whether the disqualification is set
aside for the program or agency that initiated the subsequent background study. A notice of set aside
under paragraph (c) shall be issued within 15 working days if all of the following criteria are met:
    (1) the subsequent background study was initiated in connection with a program licensed
or regulated under the same provisions of law and rule for at least one program for which the
individual's disqualification was previously set aside by the commissioner;
    (2) the individual is not disqualified for an offense specified in section 245C.15, subdivision 1
or 2;
    (3) the commissioner has received no new information to indicate that the individual may pose
a risk of harm to any person served by the program; and
   (4) the previous set aside was not limited to a specific person receiving services.
    (c) When a disqualification is set aside under paragraph (b), the notice of background study
results issued under section 245C.17, in addition to the requirements under section 245C.17, shall
state that the disqualification is set aside for the program or agency that initiated the subsequent
background study. The notice must inform the individual that the individual may request
reconsideration of the disqualification under section 245C.21 on the basis that the information used
to disqualify the individual is incorrect."

plumber, or maintenance plumber unless licensed to do so by the commissioner. A license is
not required for individuals performing building sewer or water service installation who have
completed pipe laying training as prescribed by the commissioner. A master plumber may also
work as a journeyman plumber, a restricted journeyman plumber, and a restricted master plumber.
A journeyman plumber may also work as a restricted journeyman plumber. Anyone not so licensed
may do plumbing work which complies with the provisions of the minimum standards prescribed
by the Plumbing Board on premises or that part of premises owned and actually occupied by the
worker as a residence, unless otherwise forbidden to do so by a local ordinance.
    (b) No person shall engage in the business of planning, superintending, or installing plumbing
or shall install plumbing in connection with the dealing in and selling of plumbing material and
supplies unless at all times a licensed master plumber, or in cities and towns with a population of

plumbing work on the individual's residence in accordance with subdivision 1, paragraph (a).
     (b) An individual who is an employee working on the maintenance and repair of plumbing
equipment, apparatus, or facilities owned or leased by the individual's employer and which is within
the limits of property owned or leased, and operated or maintained by the individual's employer,
shall not be required to maintain a contractor license as long as the employer has on file with
the commissioner a current certificate of responsible person. The certificate must be signed by the
responsible master plumber, licensed maintenance plumber, or, in an area of the state that is not a
city or town with a population of more than 5,000 according to the last federal census, restricted
master plumber, and must state that the person signing the certificate is responsible for ensuring
that the maintenance and repair work performed by the employer's employees comply with sections
326B.41 to 326B.49, all rules adopted under those sections and sections 326B.50 to 326B.59, and
all orders issued under section 326B.082. The employer must pay a filing fee to file a certificate of
responsible person with the commissioner. The certificate shall expire two years from the date of
filing. In order to maintain a current certificate of responsible person, the employer must resubmit
a certificate of responsible person, with a filing fee, no later than two years from the date of the
previous submittal. The filing of the certificate of responsible person does not exempt any employee
of the employer from the requirements of this chapter regarding individual licensing as a plumber

required by section 326B.092. Unless the applicant is entitled to a renewal, the applicant shall
be licensed by the commissioner only after passing a satisfactory examination developed and
administered by the commissioner, based upon rules adopted by the Plumbing Board, showing
fitness. Until the Plumbing Board adopts rules regarding the fitness of applicants for a maintenance
plumber's license, the commissioner shall develop an application designed to show that the
applicant has the qualifications, training, experience, and technical knowledge needed to properly
maintain and repair plumbing, as determined at the sole discretion of the commissioner.
    (b) All initial journeyman and maintenance plumber's licenses shall be effective for more than
one calendar year and shall expire on December 31 of the year after the year in which the application
is made. All master plumber's licenses shall expire on December 31 of each even-numbered year
