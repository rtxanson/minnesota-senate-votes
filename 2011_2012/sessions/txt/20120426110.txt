   Sec. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This article is effective July 1, 2012.
                                             ARTICLE 4
                                        HEALTH BOARDS
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 214.09, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 5. Health-related boards. No current member of a health-related licensing board may
seek a paid employment position with that board.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 214.103, is amended to read:
  214.103  HEALTH-RELATED                       LICENSING            BOARDS;           COMPLAINT,
INVESTIGATION, AND HEARING.
    Subdivision 1. Application. For purposes of this section, "board" means "health-related
licensing board" and does not include the non-health-related licensing boards. Nothing in this
section supersedes section 214.10, subdivisions 2a, 3, 8, and 9, as they apply to the health-related
licensing boards.
    Subd. 1a. Notifications and resolution. (a) No more than 14 calendar days after receiving a
complaint regarding a licensee, the board shall notify the complainant that the board has received
the complaint and shall provide the complainant with the written description of the board's complaint
process. The board shall periodically, but no less than every 120 days, notify the complainant of the
status of the complaint consistent with section 13.41.
   (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d), no more than 60 calendar days after receiving a
complaint regarding a licensee, the board must notify the licensee that the board has received a
complaint and inform the licensee of:
   (1) the substance of the complaint;
   (2) the sections of the law that have allegedly been violated;
   (3) the sections of the professional rules that have allegedly been violated; and
   (4) whether an investigation is being conducted.
    (c) The board shall periodically, but no less than every 120 days, notify the licensee of the status
of the complaint consistent with section 13.41.
   (d) Paragraphs (b) and (c) do not apply if the board determines that such notice would
compromise the board's investigation and that such notice cannot reasonably be accomplished
within this time.
    (e) No more than one year after receiving a complaint regarding a licensee, the board must
resolve or dismiss the complaint unless the board determines that resolving or dismissing the
complaint cannot reasonably be accomplished in this time and is not in the public interest.
   (f) Failure to make notifications or to resolve the complaint within the time established in this
subdivision shall not deprive the board of jurisdiction to complete the investigation or to take

corrective, disciplinary, or other action against the licensee that is authorized by law. Such a failure
by the board shall not be the basis for a licensee's request for the board to dismiss a complaint, and
shall not be considered by an administrative law judge, the board, or any reviewing court.
    Subd. 2. Receipt of complaint. The boards shall receive and resolve complaints or other
communications, whether oral or written, against regulated persons. Before resolving an oral
complaint, the executive director or a board member designated by the board to review complaints
m­­
  ay
   ­ shall require the complainant to state the complaint in writing or authorize transcribing the
complaint. The executive director or the designated board member shall determine whether the
complaint alleges or implies a violation of a statute or rule which the board is empowered to
enforce. The executive director or the designated board member may consult with the designee
of the attorney general as to a board's jurisdiction over a complaint. If the executive director or
the designated board member determines that it is necessary, the executive director may seek
additional information to determine whether the complaint is jurisdictional or to clarify the nature
of the allegations by obtaining records or other written material, obtaining a handwriting sample
from the regulated person, clarifying the alleged facts with the complainant, and requesting a
written response from the subject of the complaint.
    Subd. 3. Referral to other agencies. The executive director shall forward to another
governmental agency any complaints received by the board which do not relate to the board's
jurisdiction but which relate to matters within the jurisdiction of another governmental agency.
The agency shall advise the executive director of the disposition of the complaint. A complaint
or other information received by another governmental agency relating to a statute or rule which
a board is empowered to enforce must be forwarded to the executive director of the board to be
processed in accordance with this section. Governmental agencies may coordinate and conduct
joint investigations of complaints that involve more than one governmental agency.
    Subd. 4. Role of the attorney general. The executive director or the designated board member
shall forward a complaint and any additional information to the designee of the attorney general
when the executive director or the designated board member determines that a complaint is
jurisdictional and:
    (1) requires investigation before the executive director or the designated board member may
resolve the complaint;
    (2) that attempts at resolution for disciplinary action or the initiation of a contested case hearing
is appropriate;
   (3) that an agreement for corrective action is warranted; or
   (4) that the complaint should be dismissed, consistent with subdivision 8.
    Subd. 5. Investigation by attorney general. (a) If the executive director or the designated board
member determines that investigation is necessary before resolving the complaint, the executive
director shall forward the complaint and any additional information to the designee of the attorney
general. The designee of the attorney general shall evaluate the communications forwarded and
investigate as appropriate.
   (b) The designee of the attorney general may also investigate any other complaint forwarded
under subdivision 3 when the designee of the attorney general determines that investigation is

necessary.
    (c) In the process of evaluation and investigation, the designee shall consult with or seek the
assistance of the executive director or the designated board member. The designee may also consult
with or seek the assistance of other qualified persons who are not members of the board who the
designee believes will materially aid in the process of evaluation or investigation.
    (d) Upon completion of the investigation, the designee shall forward the investigative report to
the executive director with recommendations for further consideration or dismissal.
     Subd. 6. Attempts at resolution. (a) At any time after receipt of a complaint, the executive
director or the designated board member may attempt to resolve the complaint with the regulated
person. The available means for resolution include a conference or any other written or oral
communication with the regulated person. A conference may be held for the purposes of
investigation, negotiation, education, or conciliation. Neither the executive director nor any
member of a board's staff shall be a voting member in any attempts at resolutions which may result
in disciplinary or corrective action. The results of attempts at resolution with the regulated person
may include a recommendation to the board for disciplinary action, an agreement between the

    (1) The designee of the attorney general shall represent the board in all attempts at resolution
which the executive director or the designated board member anticipate may result in disciplinary
action. A stipulation between the executive director or the designated board member and the
regulated person shall be presented to the board for the board's consideration. An approved
stipulation and resulting order shall become public data.
    (2) The designee of the attorney general shall represent the board upon the request of the
executive director or the designated board member in all attempts at resolution which the executive
director or the designated board member anticipate may result in corrective action. Any agreement
between the executive director or the designated board member and the regulated person for
corrective action shall be in writing and shall be reviewed by the designee of the attorney general
prior to its execution. The agreement for corrective action shall provide for dismissal of the
complaint upon successful completion by the regulated person of the corrective action.
    (b) Upon receipt of a complaint alleging sexual contact or sexual conduct with a client, the board
must forward the complaint to the designee of the attorney general for an investigation. If, after it is
investigated, the complaint appears to provide a basis for disciplinary action, the board shall resolve
the complaint by disciplinary action or initiate a contested case hearing. Notwithstanding paragraph
(a), clause (2), a board may not take corrective action or dismiss a complaint alleging sexual contact
or sexual conduct with a client unless, in the opinion of the executive director, the designated board
member, and the designee of the attorney general, there is insufficient evidence to justify disciplinary
action.

rulemaking documents.
   Sec. 8. LEGACY FUNDING REQUIREMENTS APPLY.
    All appropriations in this article are onetime and are subject to the requirements and availability
provisions provided under Laws 2011, First Special Session chapter 6, articles 4 and 5. Each direct

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 3.303, subdivision 10, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 10. Constitutionally dedicated funding accountability. (a) The Legislative
Coordinating Commission shall develop and maintain a user-friendly, public-oriented Web site
that informs, educates, and demonstrates to the public how the constitutionally dedicated funds in
the arts and cultural heritage fund, outdoor heritage fund, clean water fund, parks and trails fund,
and environment and natural resources trust fund are being expended to meet the requirements
established for each fund in the state constitution. Information provided on the Web site must
include, but is not limited to:
   (1) information on all project proposals received by the Outdoor Heritage Council and the
Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources;
   (2) information on all projects receiving funding, including:
   (i) the name of the project and a project description;
    (ii) the name, telephone number, members of the board or equivalent governing body, and e-mail
address of the funding recipient and, when applicable, the Web site address where the public can
directly access detailed information on the recipient's receipt and use of money for the project;
   (iii) the amount and source of funding, including the fiscal year of the appropriation;
   (iv) the amount and source of any additional funding or leverage;
   (v) the duration of the project;
    (vi) the number of full-time equivalents funded under the project. For the purposes of this item,
"full-time equivalent" means a position directly attributed to the receipt of money from one or more
of the funds covered under this section, calculated as the total number of hours planned for the
position divided by 2,088;

    (viii) proposed measurable outcomes and the plan for measuring and evaluating the results;
   (ix) for pass-through, noncompetitive grants, the entity acting as the fiscal agent or administering

grants, including but not limited to a state agency or any statewide, regional, or local organization,
must report whether an employee, decision maker, advisory group member, or other person involved
in the grant process disclosed a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest. If the entity reports
that a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest was disclosed, the entity must provide
the Legislative Coordinating Commission with a contact person for additional information and the
Legislative Coordinating Commission must post this information on the Web site. An entity that
awards competitive grants must obtain and apply the conflict of interest policies developed by the
commissioner of administration under section 16B.98, subdivision 3, unless the entity maintains
and applies its own documented conflict of interest policies which are substantially similar to the
commissioner of administration's policies;
   (3) actual measured outcomes and evaluation of projects as required under sections 85.53,
subdivision 2; 114D.50, subdivision 4; and 129D.17, subdivision 2;

where projects have been undertaken;
    (5) all frameworks developed for future uses of each fund; and
   (6) methods by which members of the public may apply for project funds under any of the
constitutionally dedicated funds.
   Information that could be used to identify, contact, or locate an individual minor shall be withheld
from the information required for the Web site.
     (b) As soon as practicable or by January 15 of the applicable fiscal year, whichever comes
first, a state agency or other recipient of a direct appropriation from a fund covered under this
section shall submit the information required under paragraph (a) and, when applicable, compile
and submit the same information for any grant recipient or other subrecipient of funding. All
information for proposed and funded projects, including the proposed measurable outcomes, must
be made available on the Web site as soon as practicable. Information on the measured outcomes
and evaluation must be posted as soon as it becomes available. The costs of these activities shall be
paid out of the arts and cultural heritage fund, outdoor heritage fund, clean water fund, parks and
trails fund, and the environment and natural resources trust fund proportionately. For purposes of
this section, "measurable outcomes" means outcomes, indicators, or other performance measures
that may be quantified or otherwise measured in order to measure the effectiveness of a project or
program in meeting its intended goal or purpose.
   (c) The Legislative Coordinating Commission shall be responsible for receiving all ten-year
plans and 25-year frameworks for each of the constitutionally dedicated funds. To the extent
practicable, staff for the commission shall provide assistance and oversight to these planning

                     EXECUTIVE AND OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS

   The following communication was received.
                                                                                         April 26, 2012
The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
Dear Madam President:
    I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 233, Senate File 1921, a bill, which would impose
licensure requirements only upon facilities performing abortions.
    This bill would impose extensive new licensure requirements on clinics which perform 10
or more abortions per month. The bill is vague in its definition of potential licensure violations,
including penalties for undefined "conduct or practices detrimental to the welfare of the patient."
Such language could permit complaints to be filed against health care providers for almost any
reason.
    The legislation applies the existing rules for outpatient surgical centers to those targeted clinics.
The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) has informed me that this method of licensure is
inappropriate and unworkable. Clinics are very different from surgical centers. For example,
outpatient surgical center rules call for specific physical plant requirements unrelated to the safety
or protection of patients in a clinical setting. Additionally, under surgery center rules, those clinics
would be prevented from offering other services such as primary and preventive care.
    According to MDH, there are approximately 1,250 clinics in Minnesota. Despite clinics not
needing a specific state license to operate, they are already subjected to significant oversight.
Nurses and physicians are licensed under their respective health licensing boards which enforce
the standards of practice; the federal CLIA sets requirements for laboratories; OSHA requirements
must be met, as must local building codes enforcing life safety and fire safety; and health insurers
inspect clinic providers. Further, the six abortion clinics in Minnesota affected by the legislation are
members of the National Abortion Federation which sets clinical policy standards for performing
abortions and inspects every member about every five years for the following standards: infection
control, sonography, analgesia and sedation, antibiotics use, complications, and emergencies. A
lack of oversight of clinics that provide abortions is not an issue.
     The justification for this bill was questioned repeatedly throughout the legislative process. The
bill's supporters cited the lack of statutory authority for MDH to regulate or license clinics as need for
the legislation. However, MDH firmly believes that there is sufficient oversight of clinics by entities
other than MDH to protect the health and safety of Minnesotans in them. There is no evidence of
poor quality or unsafe procedures being performed in Minnesota clinics.
110TH DAY]                       THURSDAY, APRIL 26, 2012                                     6603

    Additionally, the legislation targets only facilities which provide abortions. If regulation of
clinics were the concern, the bill should have required licensure of all clinics, not just a select
few. If the Legislature wants to create a new regulatory scheme for health care clinics, then all
clinics should be treated equally. No clinic or procedure should be the focus of special and unique
regulatory requirements.
    Finally, the bill included a Constitutional Severability Clause, which suggests that the authors
feared the bill would violate the United States Supreme Court's rulings on women's constitutional
right to privacy under the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. I share those concerns
and consider it yet another reason for my veto.
                                                    Sincerely,
                                                    Mark Dayton, Governor
