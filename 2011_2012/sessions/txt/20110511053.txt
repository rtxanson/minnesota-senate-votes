   Senator Hann moved to amend S.F. No. 731 as follows:
   Page 2, after line 23, insert:
   "Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 62J.81, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Required disclosure of estimated payment. (a) A health care provider, as
defined in section 62J.03, subdivision 8, or the provider's designee as agreed to by that designee,
shall, at the request of a consumer, and at no cost to the consumer or the consumer's employer,
provide that consumer with a good faith estimate of the allowable payment the provider has agreed
to accept from the consumer's health plan company for the services specified by the consumer,
specifying the amount of the allowable payment due from the health plan company. Health
plan companies must allow contracted providers, or their designee, to release this information.
If a consumer has no applicable public or private coverage, the health care provider must give
the consumer, and at no cost to the consumer, a good faith estimate of the average allowable
reimbursement the provider accepts as payment from private third-party payers for the services
specified by the consumer and the estimated amount the noncovered consumer will be required to
pay. Payment information provided by a provider, or by the provider's designee as agreed to by that
designee, to a patient pursuant to this subdivision does not constitute a legally binding estimate of
the allowable charge for or cost to the consumer of services.
    (b) A health plan company, as defined in section 62J.03, subdivision 10, shall, at the request of
an enrollee intending to receive specific health care services or the enrollee's designee, provide that
enrollee with a good faith estimate of the allowable amount the health plan company has contracted
for with a specified provider within the network as total payment for a health care service specified
by the enrollee and the portion of the allowable amount due from the enrollee and the enrollee's
out-of-pocket costs. An estimate provided to an enrollee under this paragraph is not a legally binding
estimate of the allowable amount or enrollee's out-of-pocket cost.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment."
   Renumber the sections in sequence and correct the internal references
   Amend the title accordingly
   The motion prevailed. So the amendment was adopted.

decision-making process. The format for this certification and the process for coordination between

    (d) For purposes of this section, "patient-centered decision making" means a process that
involves directed interaction between a health care professional and the patient or the patient's
legal representative to assist the patient in understanding the patient's health condition, available
treatment options, and the benefits and harms of each option, and in deciding what treatment is best
for the patient based on the patient's circumstances, values, and preferences. The interaction may
be conducted by a health care provider or through the use of patient decision aids, or both.
    (e) For purposes of this section, "patient decision aid" means a written, audiovisual, or online
tool that provides a balanced presentation of the condition or treatment options, benefits, and harms,
and is certified by one or more national certifying organizations.
   (f) This section does not apply if any of the procedures identified in this section are performed
under an emergency situation.
   Sec. 3. SHARED DECISION-MAKING RESOURCE CENTER.
    (a) The commissioner of human services shall pursue a federal grant for the establishment and
support of a shared decision-making resource center to provide technical assistance to providers and
to develop and disseminate best practices and the information to support and accelerate to adoption
of patient decision aids and shared decision making.
    (b) If a shared decision-making resource center is established, the resource center shall review
the procedures listed in Minnesota Statutes, section 256B.768, and make recommendations to the
commissioner on procedures that should be included in the list."
