for an environmental impact statement, and the adequacy of an environmental impact statement may
be reviewed by a declaratory judgment action in the district court of the county wherein the proposed
action, or any part thereof, would be undertaken when a permit from a local unit of government is
required for the proposed action or by a petition for a writ of certiorari under sections 14.63 to
14.68 to the Court of Appeals when no local permits are required for the proposed action. The
Court of Appeals shall, whenever possible, conduct its proceedings near where the project has
been proposed. The filing of a writ of certiorari does not automatically stay further action by the
responsible governmental unit, but the Court of Appeals may order a stay upon terms that it deems
proper. Judicial review under this section shall be initiated within 30 days after the governmental
unit makes the decision, and a bond may be required under section 562.02 unless at the time of
