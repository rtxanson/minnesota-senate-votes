    Subd. 5. Withholding tax, withholding from payments to out-of-state contractors, and
withholding by partnerships and small business corporations. (a) Except as provided in
paragraph (b), an employer or person withholding tax under section 290.92 or 290.923, subdivision
2, who fails to pay to or deposit with the commissioner a sum or sums required by those sections
to be deducted, withheld, and paid, is personally and individually liable to the state for the sum
or sums, and added penalties and interest, and is not liable to another person for that payment or
payments. The sum or sums deducted and withheld under section 290.92, subdivision 2a or 3, or
290.923, subdivision 2, must be held as a special fund in trust for the state of Minnesota.
    (b) If the employer or person withholding tax under section 290.92 or 290.923, subdivision 2,
fails to deduct and withhold the tax in violation of those sections, and later the taxes against which
the tax may be credited are paid, the tax required to be deducted and withheld will not be collected
from the employer. This does not, however, relieve the employer from liability for any penalties and
interest otherwise applicable for failure to deduct and withhold. This paragraph does not apply to
an employer subject to paragraph (g), ­o­­ t­ ­
