    (b) If a district other than the resident district places a pupil for care and treatment, the district
placing the pupil must notify and give the resident district an opportunity to participate in the
placement decision. When an immediate emergency placement of a pupil is necessary and time

constraints foreclose a resident district from participating in the emergency placement decision, the
district in which the pupil is temporarily placed must notify the resident district of the emergency
placement within 15 days. The resident district has up to five business days after receiving notice
of the emergency placement to request an opportunity to participate in the placement decision,
which the placing district must then provide.
    (c) When a child is temporarily placed for care and treatment in a day program located in another
district and the child continues to live within the district of residence during the care and treatment,
the district of residence is responsible for providing transportation to and from the care and treatment
program and an appropriate educational program for the child. The resident district may establish
reasonable restrictions on transportation, except if a Minnesota court or agency orders the child
placed at a day care and treatment program and the resident district receives a copy of the order,
then the resident district must provide transportation to and from the program unless the court or
agency orders otherwise. Transportation shall only be provided by the resident district during regular
operating hours of the resident district. The resident district may provide the educational program
at a school within the district of residence, at the child's residence, or in the district in which the day
treatment center is located by paying tuition to that district.
    (d) When a child is temporarily placed in a residential program for care and treatment, the
nonresident district in which the child is placed is responsible for providing an appropriate
educational program for the child and necessary transportation while the child is attending the
educational program; and must bill the district of the child's residence for the actual cost of
providing the program, as outlined in section 125A.11, except as provided in paragraph (e).
However, the board, lodging, and treatment costs incurred in behalf of a child with a disability
placed outside of the school district of residence by the commissioner of human services or the
commissioner of corrections or their agents, for reasons other than providing for the child's special
educational needs must not become the responsibility of either the district providing the instruction
or the district of the child's residence. For the purposes of this section, the state correctional
facilities operated on a fee-for-service basis are considered to be residential programs for care and
treatment.
    (e) A privately owned and operated residential facility may enter into a contract to obtain
appropriate educational programs for special education children and services with a joint powers
entity. The entity with which the private facility contracts for special education services shall be
the district responsible for providing students placed in that facility an appropriate educational
program in place of the district in which the facility is located. If a privately owned and operated
residential facility does not enter into a contract under this paragraph, then paragraph (d) applies.
    (f) The district of residence shall pay tuition and other program costs, not including
transportation costs, to the district providing the instruction and services. The district of residence
may claim general education aid for the child as provided by law. Transportation costs must be paid
by the district responsible for providing the transportation and the state must pay transportation aid
to that district."

    (c) This section does not prohibit a requirement that a sign be displayed in a legal manner under
Minnesota law, that the sign be in good condition and not altered or defaced, or that the sign not
be affixed in a permanent manner to that portion of property to be maintained by another person or

    Subd. 4. Applicability. This section applies to all limitations prohibited by this section,
regardless of whether the homeowners association document was executed or adopted before, on,

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 515B.3-116, is amended to read:
   515B.3-116 LIEN FOR ASSESSMENTS.
    (a) The association has a lien on a unit for any assessment levied against that unit from the
time the assessment becomes due. If an assessment is payable in installments, the full amount
of the assessment is a lien from the time the first installment thereof becomes due. Unless the
declaration otherwise provides, fees, charges, late charges, fi­n
                                                                ­­e­
                                                                   s and interest charges pursuant to
section 515B.3-102(a)(10), (11) and (12) are liens, and are enforceable as assessments, under this
section. Fines for violations of the declaration, bylaws, and rules and regulations of the association
do not become a lien and are not enforceable as assessments but may be recovered in a civil action.
Recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of any assessment lien under
this section, and no further recording of any notice of or claim for the lien is required.
    (b) Subject to subsection (c), a lien under this section is prior to all other liens and encumbrances
on a unit except (i) liens and encumbrances recorded before the declaration and, in a cooperative,
liens and encumbrances which the association creates, assumes, or takes subject to, (ii) any first
mortgage encumbering the fee simple interest in the unit, or, in a cooperative, any first security
interest encumbering only the unit owner's interest in the unit, (iii) liens for real estate taxes and
other governmental assessments or charges against the unit, and (iv) a master association lien under
section 515B.2-121(h). This subsection shall not affect the priority of mechanic's liens.
     (c) If a first mortgage on a unit is foreclosed, the first mortgage was recorded after June 1,
1994, and no owner or person who acquires the owner's interest in the unit redeems pursuant to
chapter 580, 581, or 582, the holder of the sheriff's certificate of sale from the foreclosure of the
first mortgage or any person who acquires title to the unit by redemption as a junior creditor shall
take title to the unit subject to a lien in favor of the association for unpaid assessments for common
expenses levied pursuant to section 515B.3-115(a), (e)(1) to (3), (f), and (i) which became due,
without acceleration, during the six months immediately preceding the end of the owner's period of
redemption. The common expenses shall be based upon the association's then current annual budget,
notwithstanding the use of an alternate common expense plan under section 515B.3-115(a)(2). If
a first security interest encumbering a unit owner's interest in a cooperative unit which is personal
property is foreclosed, the secured party or the purchaser at the sale shall take title to the unit subject

to unpaid assessments for common expenses levied pursuant to section 515B.3-115(a), (e)(1) to (3),
(f), and (i) which became due, without acceleration, during the six months immediately preceding
the first day following either the disposition date pursuant to section 336.9-610 or the date on which
the obligation of the unit owner is discharged pursuant to section 336.9-622.
    (d) Proceedings to enforce an assessment lien shall be instituted within three years after the last
installment of the assessment becomes payable, or shall be barred.
    (e) The unit owner of a unit at the time an assessment is due shall be personally liable to the
association for payment of the assessment levied against the unit. If there are multiple owners of the
unit, they shall be jointly and severally liable.
   (f) This section does not prohibit actions to recover sums for which subsection (a) creates a lien
nor prohibit an association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure.
    (g) The association shall furnish to a unit owner or the owner's authorized agent upon written
request of the unit owner or the authorized agent a statement setting forth the amount of unpaid
assessments currently levied against the owner's unit. If the unit owner's interest is real estate, the
statement shall be in recordable form. The statement shall be furnished within ten business days
after receipt of the request and is binding on the association and every unit owner.
   (h) The association's lien may be foreclosed as provided in this subsection.
   (1) In a condominium or planned community, the association's lien may be foreclosed in a like
manner as a mortgage containing a power of sale pursuant to chapter 580, or by action pursuant to
chapter 581. The association shall have a power of sale to foreclose the lien pursuant to chapter 580.
    (2) In a cooperative whose unit owners' interests are real estate, the association's lien shall be
foreclosed in a like manner as a mortgage on real estate as provided in paragraph (1).
    (3) In a cooperative whose unit owners' interests in the units are personal property, the
association's lien shall be foreclosed in a like manner as a security interest under article 9 of
chapter 336. In any disposition pursuant to section 336.9-610 or retention pursuant to sections
336.9-620 to 336.9-622, the rights of the parties shall be the same as those provided by law, except
(i) notice of sale, disposition, or retention shall be served on the unit owner 90 days prior to sale,
disposition, or retention, (ii) the association shall be entitled to its reasonable costs and attorney
fees not exceeding the amount provided by section 582.01, subdivision 1a, (iii) the amount of the
association's lien shall be deemed to be adequate consideration for the unit subject to disposition or
retention, notwithstanding the value of the unit, and (iv) the notice of sale, disposition, or retention
shall contain the following statement in capital letters with the name of the association or secured
party filled in:

six months from the date of sale or a lesser period authorized by law, (ii) in a foreclosure by

required to be paid to redeem under section 582.03.

    Subd. 3. Compensation. The crop owner is entitled to the target price or the market price,
whichever is greater, of the damaged or destroyed crop plus adjustments for yield loss determined
according to agricultural stabilization and conservation service programs for individual farms,
adjusted annually, as determined by the commissioner, upon recommendation of the county
extension agent for the owner's county. Verification of fence damage or destruction by elk may be
provided by submitting photographs or other evidence and documentation together with a statement
from an independent witness using forms prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner,
upon recommendation of the agent, shall determine whether the crop damage or destruction or
damage to or destruction of a fence surrounding a crop or pasture is caused by elk and, if so, the
amount of the crop or fence that is damaged or destroyed. In any fiscal year, ­

not be compensated for a damaged or destroyed crop or fence surrounding a crop or pasture that is
less than $100 in value and may be compensated up to $20,000, as determined under this section,
if normal harvest procedures for the area are followed. In any fiscal year, the commissioner may
provide compensation for claims filed under this section up to the amount expressly appropriated
for this purpose.

    Subd. 4. Insurance deduction. Payments authorized by this section must be reduced by amounts
received by the owner as proceeds from an insurance policy covering crop losses or damage to or
destruction of a fence surrounding a crop or pasture, or from any other source for the same purpose
including, but not limited to, a federal program.
    Subd. 5. Decision on claims; opening land to hunting. If the commissioner finds that the crop
or pasture owner has shown that the damage or destruction of the owner's crop or damage to or
destruction of a fence surrounding a crop or pasture was caused more probably than not by elk, the
commissioner shall pay compensation as provided in this section and the rules of the commissioner.

permission, permit hunting on the land at the landowner's discretion.
    Subd. 6. Denial of claim; appeal. (a) If the commissioner denies compensation claimed by a
crop or pasture owner under this section, the commissioner shall issue a written decision based upon
the available evidence including a statement of the facts upon which the decision is based and the
conclusions on the material issues of the claim. A copy of the decision must be mailed to the crop
or pasture owner.

case review procedures of chapter 14, but a crop or pasture owner may have the claim reviewed
in a trial de novo in a court in the county where the loss occurred. The decision of the court may
be appealed as in other civil cases. Review in court may be obtained by filing a petition for review
with the administrator of the court within 60 days following receipt of a decision under this section.

    216B.03 REASONABLE RATE.
    Every rate made, demanded, or received by any public utility, or by any two or more public
utilities jointly, shall be just and reasonable. Rates shall not be unreasonably preferential,
unreasonably prejudicial, or discriminatory, but shall be sufficient, equitable, and consistent in
application to a class of consumers and among classes of consumers. To the maximum reasonable
extent, the commission shall set rates to encourage energy conservation and renewable energy
use and to further the goals of sections 216B.164, 216B.241, and 216C.05. Any doubt as to
reasonableness should be resolved in favor of the consumer. For rate-making purposes a public
utility may treat two or more municipalities served by it as a single class wherever the populations
are comparable in size or the conditions of service are similar.

unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.

Factors other than cost of service, including impact on business development and job growth, may
also be considered and evaluated by the commission in determining revenue allocations. Factors
used in determining revenue allocation must be supported by record evidence.

low-income residential ratepayers who use natural gas for heating must file an affordability program
with the commission. For purposes of this subdivision, "low-income residential ratepayers" means
ratepayers who receive energy assistance from the low-income home energy assistance program
(LIHEAP).
    (b) Any affordability program the commission orders a utility to implement must:
    (1) lower the percentage of income that participating low-income households devote to energy
bills;
    (2) increase participating customer payments over time by increasing the frequency of payments;
    (3) decrease or eliminate participating customer arrears;

     (4) lower the utility costs associated with customer account collection activities; and
   (5) coordinate the program with other available low-income bill payment assistance and
conservation resources.
   (c) In ordering affordability programs, the commission may require public utilities to file
program evaluations that measure the effect of the affordability program on:
     (1) the percentage of income that participating households devote to energy bills;
     (2) service disconnections; and
     (3) frequency of customer payments, utility collection costs, arrearages, and bad debt.
    (d) The commission must issue orders necessary to implement, administer, and evaluate
affordability programs, and to allow a utility to recover program costs, including administrative
costs, on a timely basis. The commission may not allow a utility to recover administrative costs,
excluding start-up costs, in excess of five percent of total program costs, or program evaluation
costs in excess of two percent of total program costs. The commission must permit deferred
accounting, with carrying costs, for recovery of program costs incurred during the period between
general rate cases.
   (e) Public utilities may use information collected or created for the purpose of administering
energy assistance to administer affordability programs.

    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), siting wetland replacement in the seven-county metropolitan
area must follow the priority order under this paragraph: (1) in the affected county; (2) in another of
the seven metropolitan counties; or (3) in one of the major watersheds that are wholly or partially
within the seven-county metropolitan area, but at least one to one must be replaced within the

seven-county metropolitan area.
   (d) The exception in paragraph (a), clause (6), does not apply to replacement completed using
wetland banking credits established by a person who submitted a complete wetland banking
application to a local government unit by April 1, 1996.
    (e) When reasonable, practicable, and environmentally beneficial replacement opportunities are
not available in siting priorities listed in paragraph (a), the applicant may seek opportunities at the
next level.
    (f) For the purposes of this section, "reasonable, practicable, and environmentally beneficial
replacement opportunities" are defined as opportunities that:
   (1) take advantage of naturally occurring hydrogeomorphological conditions and require
minimal landscape alteration;
     (2) have a high likelihood of becoming a functional wetland that will continue in perpetuity;
   (3) do not adversely affect other habitat types or ecological communities that are important in
maintaining the overall biological diversity of the area; and
    (4) are available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing
technology, and logistics consistent with overall project purposes.
    (g) Regulatory agencies, local government units, and other entities involved in wetland
restoration shall collaborate to identify potential replacement opportunities within their
jurisdictional areas.
     Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103G.2242, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Wetland boundary or type determination. (a) A landowner may apply for a wetland
boundary or type determination from the local government unit. The landowner applying for the
determination is responsible for submitting proof necessary to make the determination, including,
but not limited to, wetland delineation field data, observation well data, topographic mapping, survey
mapping, and information regarding soils, vegetation, hydrology, and groundwater both within and
outside of the proposed wetland boundary.
    (b) A local government unit that receives an application under paragraph (a) may seek the
advice of the Technical Evaluation Panel as described in subdivision 2, and, if necessary, expand
the Technical Evaluation Panel. The local government unit may delegate the decision authority
for wetland boundary or type determinations to designated staff, or establish other procedures it
considers appropriate.
    (c) The local government unit decision must be made in compliance with section 15.99. Within
ten calendar days of the decision, the local government unit decision must be mailed or sent by
electronic transmission to the landowner, members of the Technical Evaluation Panel, the watershed
district or watershed management organization, if one exists, and individual members of the public
who request a copy.

cannot be made within the time allowed under section 15.99, the appeal shall be considered by the
local government unit no later than its next regularly scheduled public meeting in accordance with
the minimum notice and hearing requirements applicable to the local government unit. The time
for making a decision on the appeal may be extended by consent of the appellant, the landowner
if different than the appellant, and the local government unit. A decision on an appeal by the
local government unit consistent with this subdivision shall be considered to be within the periods
provided by section 15.99.

COORDINATION.
    (a) All environmental permits that involve more than one state or federal agency shall be
managed and coordinated by the state agency with primary jurisdiction in permitting the project. If
environmental review under chapter 116D is or will be conducted for the project and a state agency
is the responsible governmental unit, the state agency named as the responsible governmental unit
shall manage and coordinate the state permitting for the project. If no state agency is the responsible
governmental unit for environmental review on the project, the agency responsible for managing
and coordinating the state permit process shall be selected by the Department of Administration.
    (b) The state agency responsible for managing and coordinating state permits under paragraph
(a) shall:
   (1) develop a timeline for all permits issued by state and federal agencies and coordinate the
permits among the agencies;
    (2) provide the project proposer the timeline for all state and federal permits; and
    (3) be the contact person for the project proposer for all state and federal permits.

resulting from any major governmental action, the action shall be preceded by a detailed
environmental impact statement prepared by the responsible governmental unit. The environmental
impact statement shall be an analytical rather than an encyclopedic document which describes the
proposed action in detail, analyzes its significant environmental impacts, discusses appropriate

impact statement shall be prepared as early as practical in the formulation of an action. No
mandatory environmental impact statement may be required for an ethanol plant, as defined in
section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), that produces less than 125,000,000 gallons of
ethanol annually and is located outside of the seven-county metropolitan area.
    (a) The board shall by rule establish categories of actions for which environmental impact
statements and for which environmental assessment worksheets shall be prepared as well as
categories of actions for which no environmental review is required under this section.
    (b) The responsible governmental unit shall promptly publish notice of the completion of
an environmental assessment worksheet in a manner to be determined by the board and shall
provide copies of the environmental assessment worksheet to the board and its member agencies.
Comments on the need for an environmental impact statement may be submitted to the responsible
governmental unit during a 30-day period following publication of the notice that an environmental
assessment worksheet has been completed. The responsible governmental unit's decision on the
need for an environmental impact statement shall be based on the environmental assessment
worksheet and the comments received during the comment period, and shall be made within 15
days after the close of the comment period. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not
more than 15 additional days upon the request of the responsible governmental unit.

reside or own property in the county or an adjoining county where the proposed action will be
located, submitted before the proposed project has received final approval by the appropriate
governmental units, demonstrates that, because of the nature or location of a proposed action,
there may be potential for significant environmental effects. Petitions requesting the preparation
of an environmental assessment worksheet shall be submitted to the board. The chair of the board
shall determine the appropriate responsible governmental unit and forward the petition to it. A
decision on the need for an environmental assessment worksheet shall be made by the responsible
governmental unit within 15 days after the petition is received by the responsible governmental
unit. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not more than 15 additional days upon
request of the responsible governmental unit.
   (d) Except in an environmentally sensitive location where Minnesota Rules, part 4410.4300,
subpart 29, item B, applies, the proposed action is exempt from environmental review under this
chapter and rules of the board, if:

   (1) the proposed action is:
   (i) an animal feedlot facility with a capacity of less than 1,000 animal units; or
   (ii) an expansion of an existing animal feedlot facility with a total cumulative capacity of less
than 1,000 animal units;
    (2) the application for the animal feedlot facility includes a written commitment by the proposer
to design, construct, and operate the facility in full compliance with Pollution Control Agency
feedlot rules; and
    (3) the county board holds a public meeting for citizen input at least ten business days prior
to the Pollution Control Agency or county issuing a feedlot permit for the animal feedlot facility
unless another public meeting for citizen input has been held with regard to the feedlot facility to be
permitted. The exemption in this paragraph is in addition to other exemptions provided under other
law and rules of the board.
    (e) The board may, prior to final approval of a proposed project, require preparation of an
environmental assessment worksheet by a responsible governmental unit selected by the board for
any action where environmental review under this section has not been specifically provided for by
rule or otherwise initiated.
    (f) An early and open process shall be utilized to limit the scope of the environmental impact
statement to a discussion of those impacts, which, because of the nature or location of the project,
have the potential for significant environmental effects. The same process shall be utilized to

280 days after notice of its preparation unless the time is extended by consent of the parties or
by the governor for good cause. The responsible governmental unit shall determine the adequacy
of an environmental impact statement, unless within 60 days after notice is published that an
environmental impact statement will be prepared, the board chooses to determine the adequacy of
an environmental impact statement. If an environmental impact statement is found to be inadequate,
the responsible governmental unit shall have 60 days to prepare an adequate environmental impact
statement.

percent of the gross profit from other forms of lawful gambling, may be expended biennially during
the term of the license for allowable expenses related to lawful gambling, except that for the period
of July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009, no more than 75 percent of the gross profit from bingo, and no
more than 65 percent of the gross profit from other forms of lawful gambling, may be expended for
allowable expenses related to lawful gambling. This provision expires June 30, 2009.
    (c) For each 12-month period beginning July 1, 2009, a licensed organization will be evaluated
by the board to determine a rating based on the percentage of annual lawful purpose expenditures
when compared to available gross profits for the same period. The rating will be used to determine
the organization's profitability percent and is not a rating of the organization's lawful gambling
operation. An organization will be evaluated according to the following criteria:
    (1) an organization that expends 50 percent or more of gross profits on lawful purposes will
receive a five-star rating;
   (2) an organization that expends 40 percent or more but less than 50 percent of gross profits on
lawful purposes will receive a four-star rating;
   (3) an organization that expends 30 percent or more but less than 40 percent of gross profits on
lawful purposes will receive a three-star rating;
   (4) an organization that expends 20 percent or more but less than 30 percent of gross profits on
lawful purposes will receive a two-star rating; and
    (5) an organization that expends less than 20 percent of gross profits on lawful purposes will
receive a one-star rating.
   (d) An organization that fails to expend a minimum of 30 percent annually of gross profits on
lawful purposes, or 20 percent annually for organizations that conduct lawful gambling in a location
where the primary business is bingo, is automatically on probation effective July 1 for a period of

to residential real property or a dwelling where the person holding the residential real property
or dwelling after the expiration of the time for redemption on foreclosure of a mortgage was a
tenant during the redemption period under a lease of any duration, and the lease began after the date
