    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 151.19, is amended by adding a subdivision
to read:
    Subd. 4. Licensing of physicians to dispense drugs; renewals. (a) The board may grant a
license to any physician licensed under chapter 147 authorizing the physician to dispense drugs to
individuals for whom pharmaceutical care is not reasonably available. The license may be renewed
annually. Any physician licensed under this subdivision shall be limited to dispensing drugs in a
limited services pharmacy and shall be governed by the rules adopted by the board when dispensing
drugs.
    (b) For the purposes of this subdivision, pharmaceutical care is not reasonably available if the
pharmacy in which the physician is dispensing drugs is located in a health professional shortage
area.
   (c) For the purposes of this subdivision, section 151.15, subdivision 2, shall not apply, and section
151.215 shall not apply provided that a physician granted a license under this subdivision certifies
each filled prescription in accordance with Minnesota Rules, part 6800.3100, subpart 3.
    (d) Notwithstanding section 151.102, a physician granted a license under this subdivision may
be assisted by a pharmacy technician if the technician holds a valid certification from the Pharmacy
Technician Certification Board or from another national certification body for pharmacy technicians
that requires passage of a nationally recognized psychometrically valid certification examination
for certification as determined by the board. The physician may supervise the pharmacy technician
as long as the physician assumes responsibility for all functions performed by the technician. For
purposes of this subdivision, supervision does not require the physician to be physically present if
the physician or a licensed pharmacist is available, either electronically or by telephone.
   (e) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to prohibit a physician from dispensing drugs
pursuant to section 151.37 and Minnesota Rules, parts 6800.9950 to 6800.9954."

   "Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 168.013, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3. Application; cancellation; excessive gross weight forbidden. (a) The applicant for
all licenses based on gross weight shall state the unloaded weight of the motor vehicle, trailer, or
semitrailer and the maximum load the applicant proposes to carry on it, the sum of which constitutes
the gross weight upon which the license tax must be paid. However, the declared gross weight upon
which the tax is paid must not be less than 1-1/4 times the declared unloaded weight of the motor
vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer to be registered, except recreational vehicles taxed under subdivision
1g, school buses taxed under subdivision 18, and tow trucks or towing vehicles defined in section
169.011, subdivision 83. The gross weight of a tow truck or towing vehicle is the actual weight of
the tow truck or towing vehicle fully equipped, but does not include the weight of a wrecked or
disabled vehicle towed or drawn by the tow truck or towing vehicle.
   (b) The gross weight of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer must not exceed the gross weight
upon which the license tax has been paid by more than four percent or 1,000 pounds, whichever is
greater; provided that, a vehicle transporting unfinished forest products on a highway, other than a
highway that is part of the system of interstate and defense highways, unless a federal exemption is
granted, in accordance with paragraph (d)(3):
    (1) shall not exceed its gross vehicle weight upon which the license tax has been paid, or gross
axle weight on any axle, by more than five percent and, notwithstanding other law to the contrary,
is not subject to any fee, fine, or other assessment or penalty for exceeding a gross vehicle or axle
weight by up to five percent; and
    (2) between the dates set by the commissioner in accordance with section 169.826, subdivision
1, is not subject to any provision of paragraph (d) or chapter 169 limiting the gross axle weight of
any individual axle unless the entire vehicle also exceeds its gross vehicle weight plus its weight
allowance allowed in clause (1) and plus any weight allowance permitted under section 169.826, in
which case the vehicle is subject to all applicable penalties for excess weight violations.
   (c) The gross weight of the motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer for which the license tax is
paid must be indicated by a distinctive character on the license plate or plates except as provided in

subdivision 12 and the plate or plates must be kept clean and clearly visible at all times.
    (d) The owner, driver, or user of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer, upon conviction
for transporting a gross weight in excess of the gross weight for which it was registered or for
operating a vehicle with an axle weight exceeding the maximum lawful axle load weight, is guilty
of a misdemeanor and subject to increased registration or reregistration according to the following
schedule:
    (1) Upon conviction for transporting a gross weight in excess of the gross weight for which a
motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer is registered by more than the allowance set forth in paragraph
(b) but less than 25 percent, or for operating or using a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer with an
axle weight exceeding the maximum lawful axle load as provided in sections 169.822 to 169.829
by more than the allowance set forth in paragraph (b) but less than 25 percent, the owner, driver,
or user of the motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer used to commit the violation, in addition to any
penalty imposed for the misdemeanor, shall apply to the registrar to increase the authorized gross
weight to be carried on the vehicle to a weight equal to or greater than the gross weight the owner,
driver, or user was convicted of carrying. The increase is computed for the balance of the calendar
year on the basis of 1/12 of the annual tax for each month remaining in the calendar year beginning
with the first day of the month in which the violation occurred. If the additional registration tax
computed upon that weight, plus the tax already paid, amounts to more than the regular tax for the
maximum gross weight permitted for the vehicle under sections 169.822 to 169.829, that additional
amount must nevertheless be paid into the highway fund, but the additional tax thus paid does not
authorize or permit any person to operate the vehicle with a gross weight in excess of the maximum
legal weight as provided by sections 169.822 to 169.829. Unless the owner within 30 days after
a conviction applies to increase the authorized weight and pays the additional tax as provided in
this section, the registrar shall revoke the registration on the vehicle and demand the return of the
registration card and plates issued on that registration.
    (2) Upon conviction of an owner, driver, or user of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer for
transporting a gross weight in excess of the gross weight for which the motor vehicle, trailer, or
semitrailer was registered by 25 percent or more or for operating or using the vehicle or trailer
with an axle weight exceeding the maximum lawful axle load as provided in sections 169.822 to
169.829 by 25 percent or more, and in addition to any penalty imposed for the misdemeanor, the
registrar shall either (i) cancel the reciprocity privileges on the vehicle involved if the vehicle is
being operated under reciprocity or (ii) if the vehicle is not being operated under reciprocity, cancel
the certificate of registration on the vehicle operated and demand the return of the registration
certificate and registration plates. The registrar may not cancel the registration or reciprocity
privileges for any vehicle found in violation of seasonal load restrictions imposed under section
169.87 unless the axle weight exceeds the year-round weight limit for the highway on which the
violation occurred. The registrar may investigate any allegation of gross weight violations and
demand that the operator show cause why all future operating privileges in the state should not be
revoked unless the additional tax assessed is paid.
    (3) Clause (1) does not apply to the first haul of unprocessed or raw farm products or unfinished
forest products, when the registered gross weight is not exceeded by more than ten percent. For
purposes of this clause, "first haul" means (i) the first, continuous transportation of unprocessed
or raw farm products from the place of production or on-farm storage site to any other location
within 5­0
         ­ 100 miles of the place of production or on-farm storage site, or (ii) the continuous or

noncontinuous transportation of unfinished forest products from the place of production to the place
of final processing or manufacture located within 200 miles of the place of production.
    (4) When the registration on a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer is revoked by the registrar
according to this section, the vehicle must not be operated on the highways of the state until it is
registered or reregistered, as the case may be, and new plates issued, and the registration fee is the
annual tax for the total gross weight of the vehicle at the time of violation. The reregistration pursuant
to this subdivision of any vehicle operating under reciprocity agreements pursuant to section 168.181
or 168.187 must be at the full annual registration fee without regard to the percentage of vehicle
miles traveled in this state."
