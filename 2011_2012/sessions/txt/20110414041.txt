   Sec. 4. [145.4141] DEFINITIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Scope. For purposes of sections 145.4141 to 145.4148, the following terms have
41ST DAY]                         THURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2011                                      1289

the meanings given them.
    Subd. 2. Abortion. "Abortion" means the use or prescription of any instrument, medicine, drug,
or any other substance or device to terminate the pregnancy of a woman known to be pregnant with
an intention other than to increase the probability of a live birth, to preserve the life or health of
the child after live birth, or to remove a dead unborn child who died as the result of natural causes
in utero, accidental trauma, or a criminal assault on the pregnant woman or her unborn child, and
which causes the premature termination of the pregnancy.
    Subd. 3. Attempt to perform or induce an abortion. "Attempt to perform or induce an
abortion" means an act, or an omission of a statutorily required act, that, under the circumstances
as the actor believes them to be, constitutes a substantial step in a course of conduct planned
to culminate in the performance or induction of an abortion in this state in violation of sections
145.4141 to 145.4148.
   Subd. 4. Fertilization. "Fertilization" means the fusion of a human spermatozoon with a human
ovum.
    Subd. 5. Medical emergency. "Medical emergency" means a condition that, in reasonable
medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of the pregnant woman that it necessitates
the immediate abortion of her pregnancy without first determining postfertilization age to avert
her death or for which the delay necessary to determine postfertilization age will create serious
risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function not including
psychological or emotional conditions. No condition shall be deemed a medical emergency if
based on a claim or diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct which she intends to result in
her death or in substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.
    Subd. 6. Physician. "Physician" means any person licensed to practice medicine and surgery or
osteopathic medicine and surgery in this state.
    Subd. 7. Postfertilization age. "Postfertilization age" means the age of the unborn child as
calculated from the fusion of a human spermatozoon with a human ovum.
    Subd. 8. Probable postfertilization age of the unborn child. "Probable postfertilization age of
the unborn child" means what, in reasonable medical judgment, will with reasonable probability be
the postfertilization age of the unborn child at the time the abortion is planned to be performed or
induced.
   Subd. 9. Reasonable medical judgment. "Reasonable medical judgment" means a medical
judgment that would be made by a reasonably prudent physician knowledgeable about the case
and the treatment possibilities with respect to the medical conditions involved.
    Subd. 10. Unborn child or fetus. "Unborn child" or "fetus" means an individual organism of
the species homo sapiens from fertilization until live birth.
   Subd. 11. Woman. "Woman" means a female human being whether or not she has reached the
age of majority.
   Sec. 5. [145.4142] LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   (a) The legislature makes the following findings.
1290                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [41ST DAY

    (b) Pain receptors (nociceptors) are present throughout an unborn child's entire body and nerves
link these receptors to the brain's thalamus and subcortical plate by 20 weeks.
    (c) By eight weeks after fertilization, an unborn child reacts to touch. After 20 weeks an unborn
child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human, for example
by recoiling.
    (d) In the unborn child, application of such painful stimuli is associated with significant increases
in stress hormones known as the stress response.
    (e) Subjection to such painful stimuli is associated with long-term harmful neurodevelopmental
effects, such as altered pain sensitivity and, possibly, emotional, behavioral, and learning disabilities
later in life.
   (f) For the purposes of surgery on an unborn child, fetal anesthesia is routinely administered
and is associated with a decrease in stress hormones compared to the level when painful stimuli is
applied without anesthesia.
    (g) The position, asserted by some medical experts, that an unborn child is incapable of
experiencing pain until a point later in pregnancy than 20 weeks after fertilization predominately
rests on the assumption that the ability to experience pain depends on the cerebral cortex and
requires nerve connections between the thalamus and the cortex. However, recent medical research
and analysis, especially since 2007, provides strong evidence for the conclusion that a functioning
cortex is not necessary to experience pain.
   (h) Substantial evidence indicates that children born missing the bulk of the cerebral cortex,
those with hydranencephaly, nevertheless experience pain.
    (i) In adults, stimulation or ablation of the cerebral cortex does not alter pain perception, while
stimulation or ablation of the thalamus does.
    (j) Substantial evidence indicates that structures used for pain processing in early development
differ from those of adults, using different neural elements available at specific times during
development, such as the subcortical plate, to fulfill the role of pain processing.
    (k) The position asserted by some medical experts, that the unborn child remains in a coma-like
sleep state that precludes the unborn child experiencing pain is inconsistent with the documented
reaction of unborn children to painful stimuli and with the experience of fetal surgeons who have
found it necessary to sedate the unborn child with anesthesia to prevent the unborn child from
thrashing about in reaction to invasive surgery.
   (l) Consequently, there is substantial medical evidence that an unborn child is capable of
experiencing pain by 20 weeks after fertilization.
    (m) It is the purpose of the state to assert a compelling state interest in protecting the lives of
unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates that they are capable
of feeling pain.
   Sec. 6. [145.4143] DETERMINATION OF GESTATIONAL AGE.
   Subdivision 1. Determination of postfertilization age. Except in the case of a medical
emergency, no abortion shall be performed or induced or be attempted to be performed or induced
41ST DAY]                          THURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2011                                      1291

unless the physician performing or inducing it has first made a determination of the probable
postfertilization age of the unborn child or relied upon such a determination made by another
physician. In making such a determination, the physician shall make those inquiries of the woman
and perform or cause to be performed those medical examinations and tests that a reasonably
prudent physician, knowledgeable about the case and the medical conditions involved, would
consider necessary to perform in making an accurate diagnosis with respect to postfertilization age.
    Subd. 2. Unprofessional conduct. Failure by any physician to conform to any requirement of
this section constitutes unprofessional conduct under section 147.091, paragraph (k).
  Sec. 7. [145.4144] ABORTION OF UNBORN CHILD OF 20 OR MORE WEEKS
GESTATIONAL AGE PROHIBITED; CAPABLE OF FEELING PAIN.
    Subdivision 1. Abortion prohibition; exemption. No person shall perform or induce or attempt
to perform or induce an abortion upon a woman when it has been determined, by the physician
performing or inducing or attempting to perform or induce the abortion, or by another physician upon
whose determination that physician relies, that the probable postfertilization age of the woman's
unborn child is 20 or more weeks unless, in reasonable medical judgment, she has a condition which
so complicates her medical condition as to necessitate the abortion of her pregnancy to avert her
death or to avert serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily
function, not including psychological or emotional conditions. No such condition shall be deemed to
exist if it is based on a claim or diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct which she intends to
result in her death or in substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.
    Subd. 2. When abortion not prohibited. When an abortion upon a woman whose unborn child
has been determined to have a probable postfertilization age of 20 or more weeks is not prohibited
by this section, the physician shall terminate the pregnancy in the manner which, in reasonable
medical judgment, provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive unless, in reasonable
medical judgment, termination of the pregnancy in that manner would pose a greater risk either
of the death of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of
a major bodily function, not including psychological or emotional conditions, of the woman than
would other available methods. No such greater risk shall be deemed to exist if it is based on a claim
or diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct which she intends to result in her death or in
substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.
   Sec. 8. [145.4145] ENFORCEMENT.
    Subdivision 1. Criminal penalties. A person who intentionally or recklessly performs or induces
or attempts to perform or induce an abortion in violation of sections 145.4141 to 145.4148 shall
be guilty of a felony. No penalty may be assessed against the woman upon whom the abortion is
performed or induced or attempted to be performed or induced.
    Subd. 2. Civil remedies. (a) A woman upon whom an abortion has been performed or induced in
violation of sections 145.4141 to 145.4148, or the father of the unborn child who was the subject of

    (b) A cause of action for injunctive relief against a person who has intentionally violated sections
145.4141 to 145.4148 may be maintained by the woman upon whom an abortion was performed or
induced or attempted to be performed or induced in violation of sections 145.4141 to 145.4148; by

   Sec. 9. [145.4146] PROTECTION OF PRIVACY IN COURT PROCEEDINGS.
    In every civil or criminal proceeding or action brought under the Pain-Capable Unborn Child
Protection Act, the court shall rule on whether the anonymity of a woman upon whom an abortion
has been performed or induced or attempted to be performed or induced shall be preserved from
public disclosure if she does not give her consent to such disclosure. The court, upon motion or sua
sponte, shall make such a ruling and, upon determining that her anonymity should be preserved,
shall issue orders to the parties, witnesses, and counsel and shall direct the sealing of the record and
exclusion of individuals from courtrooms or hearing rooms to the extent necessary to safeguard her
identity from public disclosure. Each such order shall be accompanied by specific written findings
explaining why the anonymity of the woman should be preserved from public disclosure, why the
order is essential to that end, how the order is narrowly tailored to serve that interest, and why no
reasonable, less restrictive alternative exists. In the absence of written consent of the woman upon
whom an abortion has been performed or induced or attempted to be performed or induced, anyone,
other than a public official, who brings an action under section 145.4145, subdivision 2, shall do so
under a pseudonym. This section may not be construed to conceal the identity of the plaintiff or of
witnesses from the defendant or from attorneys for the defendant.

    If any one or more provisions, sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, phrases, or words
of sections 145.4141 to 145.4148, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is
found to be unconstitutional, the same is hereby declared to be severable and the balance of
sections 145.4141 to 145.4148 shall remain effective notwithstanding such unconstitutionality.
The legislature hereby declares that it would have passed sections 145.4141 to 145.4148, and each
provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word thereof, irrespective of the fact
that any one or more provisions, sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, phrases, or words of
sections 145.4141 to 145.4148, or the application of sections 145.4141 to 145.4148, would be

benefits under this chapter is entitled to the full medical expense benefits set forth in subdivision 2,
and may not receive medical expense benefits that are in any way less than those provided for in
subdivision 2, or that involve any preestablished limitations on the benefits. Medical expenses must
be reasonable and must be for necessary medical care as provided in subdivision 2. This paragraph
shall not be deemed to alter the obligations of an insured or the rights of a reparation obligor as set
forth in section 65B.56. This paragraph does not apply to medical expense loss that is subject to
paragraph (d).
    (c) No reparation obligor or health plan company as defined in section 62Q.01, subdivision 4,
may enter into or renew any contract that provides, or has the effect of providing, managed care
services to no-fault claimants. For the purposes of this section, "managed care services" is defined
as any program of medical services that uses health care providers managed, owned, employed by,
or under contract with a health plan company.
    (d) Medical expense loss for diagnosis and treatment of a soft tissue injury is covered only
if provided in compliance with the codes, treatment standards, and fee schedules provided in
Minnesota Rules, chapter 5221. The term soft tissue injury specifically includes, without limitation,
any injury with treatment covered by the procedure codes set forth in Minnesota Rules, chapter
5221, other than such treatment delivered by a health care provider defined in Minnesota Rules,
part 5221.0100, subpart 11a, or by a medical facility described in section 176.136, subdivision 1b,
paragraphs (a) and (b).
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 65B.44, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Disability and income loss benefits. Disability and income loss benefits shall provide
compensation for 85 percent of the injured person's loss of present and future gross income from
inability to work proximately caused by the nonfatal injury subject to a maximum of ­   $2

employees to perform tasks which are necessary to maintain the income of the injured person, which
are normally performed by the injured person, and which cannot be performed because of the injury.
   If the injured person is unemployed at the time of injury and is receiving or is eligible to receive
unemployment benefits under chapter 268, but the injured person loses eligibility for those benefits
because of inability to work caused by the injury, disability and income loss benefits shall provide
compensation for the lost benefits in an amount equal to the unemployment benefits which otherwise
would have been payable, subject to a maximum of ­    $2

    Compensation under this subdivision shall be reduced by any income from substitute work
actually performed by the injured person or by income the injured person would have earned in
available appropriate substitute work which the injured person was capable of performing but
unreasonably failed to undertake.
    For the purposes of this section "inability to work" means disability which prevents the injured
person from engaging in any substantial gainful occupation or employment on a regular basis, for
wage or profit, for which the injured person is or may by training become reasonably qualified. If
the injured person returns to employment and is unable by reason of the injury to work continuously,
compensation for lost income shall be reduced by the income received while the injured person is
actually able to work. The weekly maximums may not be prorated to arrive at a daily maximum,
even if the injured person does not incur loss of income for a full week.

fishing equipment used in Lake Superior.
    (b) All nets, traps, buoys, anchors, stakes, and lines used for commercial fishing or turtle, frog, or
crayfish harvesting in an infested water that is designated solely because it contains Eurasian water
milfoil must be dried for a minimum of ten days or frozen for a minimum of two days before they
are used in any other waters, except as provided in this paragraph. Commercial licensees must notify
the department's regional or area fisheries office or a conservation officer before removing nets or
equipment from an infested water designated solely because it contains Eurasian water milfoil and
before resetting those nets or equipment in any other waters. Upon notification, the commissioner
may authorize a commercial licensee to move nets or equipment to another water without freezing
or drying, if that water is designated as infested solely because it contains Eurasian water milfoil.
   (c) A commercial licensee must remove all aquatic macrophytes from nets and other equipment
when the nets and equipment are removed from waters of the state.
    (d) The commissioner shall provide a commercial licensee with a current listing of designated
infested waters at the time that a license or permit is issued.
    (e) A person harvesting aquatic life from waters of the state for the purpose of transporting and
stocking shall transport the aquatic life to a holding facility. The aquatic life shall remain in the
holding facility for at least ten hours and be examined for the presence of invasive species.
     (f) This subdivision applies to the state and its departments and agencies.

    Subdivision 1. Introduction of nonnative and invasive species; notification. (a) A person
that allows or causes the introduction of an animal that is a prohibited invasive, regulated invasive,
or unlisted nonnative species shall, within 24 hours after learning of the introduction, notify the
commissioner, a conservation officer, or another person designated by the commissioner. The person
shall make every reasonable attempt to recapture or destroy the introduced animal. If the animal is
a prohibited invasive species, the person is liable for the actual costs incurred by the department
in capturing or controlling, or attempting to capture or control, the animal and its progeny. If the
animal is a regulated invasive species, the person is liable for these costs if the introduction was in
violation of the person's permit issued under section 84D.11.
   (b) A person that complies with this section is not subject to criminal penalties under section
84D.13 for the introduction.
    Subd. 2. Aquatic invasive species; notification. (a) Identification of an aquatic invasive species
through sampling and monitoring procedures at a location where that species has not been known
to exist shall be reported immediately to the commissioner or an inspector.
    (b) Any person that becomes aware of or suspects an aquatic invasive species being present at
a location where that species has not been known to exist shall report the aquatic invasive species
presence within 48 hours to the commissioner or an inspector.

   Subd. 6a. Professional designation coursework. Approved courses leading to the achievement
or maintenance of a professional designation listed in section 60K.36, subdivision 4a, qualify for
continuing education.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 45.30, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Courses open to all. (a) All course offerings must be open to any interested individuals.
Access may be restricted by the education provider based on class size only, except that access
to a course offering sponsored by, offered by, or affiliated with an insurance company or agency
may be restricted to agents of the company or agency. Courses must not be approved if attendance
is restricted to any particular group of people, except for company-sponsored courses allowed by
statute.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), attendance at approved courses leading to the achievement
or maintenance of a professional designation listed in section 60K.36, subdivision 4a, may be
limited to those producers seeking the professional designation or those producers who have
met prerequisite coursework for the course offering. Courses leading to the achievement or
maintenance of a professional designation listed in section 60K.36, subdivision 4a, may require
a prerequisite such as candidacy for the designation or sequential coursework relating to the
attainment or maintenance of the designation. A course leading to the achievement or maintenance

   A self-study course must not be approved unless it is objectively verifiable that:
   (1) it includes a closed-book, end-of-course examination; and

facility that is adequate to comfortably accommodate the faculty and the number of students
enrolled. The education provider may limit the number of students enrolled in a course. Approved
courses must not be held on the premises of a company doing business in the regulated area, except
for company-sponsored courses allowed by statute or noncompany sponsored courses offered by
a bona fide trade association. A bona fide trade association may offer noncompany sponsored

period. No more than one-half of the credit hours per licensing period required under this section
may be credited to a person for attending courses either sponsored by, offered by, or affiliated with
an insurance company or its agents. For the purposes of this subdivision, a course provided by a
bona fide insurance trade association is not considered to be sponsored by, offered by, or affiliated
with an insurance company or its agents regardless of the location of the course offering. A licensee
must obtain three hours of the credit hours per licensing period from a class or classes in the area
of ethics. Courses sponsored by, offered by, or affiliated with an insurance company or agent may

   "Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 79A.06, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Private employers who have ceased to be self-insured. (a) Private employers who
have ceased to be private self-insurers shall discharge their continuing obligations to secure the
payment of compensation which is accrued during the period of self-insurance, for purposes of Laws
1988, chapter 674, sections 1 to 21, by compliance with all of the following obligations of current
certificate holders:
   (1) Filing reports with the commissioner to carry out the requirements of this chapter;
    (2) Depositing and maintaining a security deposit for accrued liability for the payment of any
compensation which may become due, pursuant to chapter 176. However, if a private employer
who has ceased to be a private self-insurer purchases an insurance policy from an insurer authorized
to transact workers' compensation insurance in this state which provides coverage of all claims
for compensation arising out of injuries occurring during the entire period the employer was
self-insured, whether or not reported during that period, the policy will:
    (i) discharge the obligation of the employer to maintain a security deposit for the payment of the
claims covered under the policy;
    (ii) discharge any obligation which the self-insurers' security fund has or may have for payment
of all claims for compensation arising out of injuries occurring during the period the employer was
self-insured, whether or not reported during that period; and
    (iii) discharge the obligations of the employer to pay any future assessments to the self-insurers'
security fund; provided, however, that a member that terminates its self-insurance authority on or
after August 1, 2010, shall be liable for an assessment under paragraph (b). The actuarial opinion
shall not take into consideration any transfer of the member's liabilities to an insurance policy if the
member obtains a replacement policy as described in this subdivision within one year of the date of
terminating its self-insurance.
    A private employer who has ceased to be a private self-insurer may instead buy an insurance
policy described above, except that it covers only a portion of the period of time during which
41ST DAY]                          THURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2011                                        1327

the private employer was self-insured; purchase of such a policy discharges any obligation that the
self-insurers' security fund has or may have for payment of all claims for compensation arising out of
injuries occurring during the period for which the policy provides coverage, whether or not reported
during that period.
   A policy described in this clause may not be issued by an insurer unless it has previously been
approved as to the insurer, form, and substance by the commissioner; and
    (3) Paying within 30 days all assessments of which notice is sent by the security fund, for a
period of seven years from the last day its certificate of self-insurance was in effect. Thereafter, the
private employer who has ceased to be a private self-insurer may either: (i) continue to pay within
30 days all assessments of which notice is sent by the security fund until it has no incurred liabilities
for the payment of compensation arising out of injuries during the period of self-insurance; or (ii)
pay the security fund a cash payment equal to four percent of the net present value of all remaining
incurred liabilities for the payment of compensation under sections 176.101 and 176.111 as certified
by a member of the casualty actuarial society. Assessments shall be based on the benefits paid by the
employer during the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the employer's
right to self-insure is terminated or withdrawn.
    (b) With respect to a self-insurer who terminates its self-insurance authority after April 1, 1998,
that member shall obtain and file with the commissioner an actuarial opinion of its outstanding
liabilities as determined by an associate or fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society within 120
days of the date of its termination. If the actuarial opinion is not timely filed, the self-insurers'
security fund may, at its discretion, engage the services of an actuary for this purpose. The expense
of this actuarial opinion must be assessed against and be the obligation of the self-insurer. The
commissioner may issue a certificate of default against the self-insurer for failure to pay this
assessment to the self-insurers' security fund as provided by section 79A.04, subdivision 9. The
opinion may discount liabilities up to four percent per annum to net present value. Within 60 days
after notification of approval of the actuarial opinion by the commissioner, the exiting member
shall pay to the security fund an amount determined as follows: a percentage will be determined
by dividing the security fund's members' deficit as determined by the most recent audited financial
statement of the security fund by the total actuarial liability of all members of the security fund
as calculated by the commissioner within 30 days of the exit date of the member. This quotient
will then be multiplied by that exiting member's total future liability as contained in the exiting
member's actuarial opinion. If the payment is not made within 30 days of the notification, interest
on it at the rate prescribed by section 549.09 must be paid by the former member to the security
fund until the principal amount is paid in full.
    (c) A former member who terminated its self-insurance authority before April 1, 1998, who
has paid assessments to the self-insurers' security fund for seven years, and whose annualized
assessment is $15,000 or less, may buy out of its outstanding liabilities to the self-insurers' security
fund by an amount calculated as follows: 1.35 multiplied by the indemnity case reserves at the time
of the calculation, multiplied by the then current self-insurers' security fund annualized assessment
rate.
    (d) A former member who terminated its self-insurance authority before April 1, 1998, and who
is paying assessments within the first seven years after ceasing to be self-insured under paragraph
(a), clause (3), may elect to buy out its outstanding liabilities to the self-insurers' security fund
by obtaining and filing with the commissioner an actuarial opinion of its outstanding liabilities as
1328                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [41ST DAY

determined by an associate or fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society. The opinion must separate
liability for indemnity benefits from liability for medical benefits, and must discount each up to four
percent per annum to net present value. Within 30 days after notification of approval of the actuarial
opinion by the commissioner, the member shall pay to the security fund an amount equal to 120
percent of that discounted outstanding indemnity liability, multiplied by the greater of the average
annualized assessment rate since inception of the security fund or the annual rate at the time of the
most recent assessment.
    (e) A former member who has paid the security fund according to paragraphs (b) to (d) and
subsequently receives authority from the commissioner to again self-insure shall be assessed under
section 79A.12, subdivision 2, only on indemnity benefits paid on injuries that occurred after the
former member received authority to self-insure again; provided that the member furnishes verified
data regarding those benefits to the security fund.
    (f) In addition to proceedings to establish liabilities and penalties otherwise provided, a failure
to comply may be the subject of a proceeding before the commissioner. An appeal from the
commissioner's determination may be taken pursuant to the contested case procedures of chapter
14 within 30 days of the commissioner's written determination.
    Any current or past member of the self-insurers' security fund is subject to service of process
on any claim arising out of chapter 176 or this chapter in the manner provided by section 5.25, or
as otherwise provided by law. The issuance of a certificate to self-insure to the private self-insured
employer shall be deemed to be the agreement that any process which is served in accordance with
this section shall be of the same legal force and effect as if served personally within this state.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 79A.24, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Purchase of insurance policy from an authorized insurer. A commercial
self-insurance group may purchase an insurance policy from an insurer authorized to transact
workers' compensation insurance in this state which provides coverage of all claims for
compensation arising out of injuries occurring during the entire period or during a portion of the
period of time in which the commercial self-insurance group has been in existence. While the
insurance policy remains in effect, it discharges the obligation of the commercial self-insurance
group to maintain a security deposit for the claims covered under the policy. A policy described in
this subdivision may not be issued by an insurer unless it has previously been approved as to the
insurer, form, and substance by the commissioner.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 79A.24, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. Insolvency of a commercial self-insurance group insurer. In the event of the
insolvency of the insurer that issued a policy under subdivision 5 to a commercial self-insurance
group, eligibility for chapter 60C coverage under the policy is determined by applying the
requirements of section 60C.09, subdivision 2, clause (3), to each commercial self-insurance group
member separately, rather than to the net worth of the commercial self-insurance group entity or
aggregate net worth of all members of the commercial self-insurance group.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment."

    (b) The commissioner must consider the compliance history, enforcement record, and other
public safety or environmental risk factors in determining the eligibility of a person or site for the
reduced frequency of inspection described in paragraph (a). If the commissioner determines that a
person or site is ineligible, the commissioner must notify the person or site of that ineligibility and
the reasons for that determination.
   (c) The compliance findings of the commissioner's inspection of a person or site that stores,
handles, or distributes ammonia and anhydrous ammonia fertilizer may be used as a basis for

0.1 percent of sales of the pesticide in the state and sales of pesticides for use in the state during the
previous calendar year, except the surcharge may not be imposed on pesticides that are sanitizers or
disinfectants as determined by the commissioner. No surcharge is required if the surcharge amount
based on percent of annual gross sales of a nonagricultural pesticide is less than $10. Sales of

An agricultural society may sue and be sued in its corporate name; may adopt bylaws, rules, and
regulations, alter and amend the same; may purchase and hold, lease and control any real or personal
property deemed to promote the objects of the society, and may rent, lease, sell, exchange, and
convey the same. Any income from the rental or lease of the property may be used for any or all of
the following purposes: (1) Acquisition of additional real property; (2) Construction of additional
buildings; or (3) Maintenance and care of the society's property. This section shall not be construed
to preclude the continuance of any agricultural society now existing or the granting of aid to the
society.
    (b) An agricultural society shall have jurisdiction and control of the grounds upon which its fairs
are held and of the streets and adjacent grounds during the fair, so far as may be necessary for fair

   (d) Any person who shall willfully violate any rule or regulation made by agricultural societies
during the days of a fair shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
   The provisions of this section supersede all special laws on the same subject.

necessary to the exercise of its corporate powers.
    (b) No sale, lease, or conveyance of real estate owned by the county, except the lease of a

contain a legal description of any real estate, and a brief description of any personal property. Leases
that do not exceed $15,000 for any one year may be negotiated and are not subject to the competitive
bid procedures of this section. All proposals estimated to exceed $15,000 in any one year shall be
considered at the time set for the bid opening, and the one most favorable to the county accepted,
but the county board may, in the interest of the county, reject any or all proposals.
    (c) Sales of personal property the value of which is estimated to be $15,000 or more shall be
made only after advertising for bids or proposals in the county's official newspaper, on the county's
Web site, or in a recognized industry trade journal. At the same time it posts on its Web site or
publishes in a trade journal, the county must publish in the official newspaper, either as part of the
minutes of a regular meeting of the county board or in a separate notice, a summary of all requests
for bids or proposals that the county advertises on its Web site or in a trade journal. After publication

of personal property the value of which is estimated to be less than $15,000 may be made either
on competitive bids or in the open market, in the discretion of the county board. "Web site" means
a specific, addressable location provided on a server connected to the Internet and hosting World
Wide Web pages and other files that are generally accessible on the Internet all or most of a day.
    (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the county may, when acquiring real
property for county highway right-of-way, exchange parcels of real property of substantially
similar or equal value without advertising for bids. The estimated values for these parcels shall be
determined by the county assessor.
   (e) Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the county may, when acquiring real
property for purposes other than county highway right-of-way, exchange parcels of real property of
substantially similar or equal value without advertising for bids. The estimated values for these
parcels must be determined by the county assessor or a private appraisal performed by a licensed
Minnesota real estate appraiser. Before giving final approval to any exchange of land, the county
board shall hold a public hearing on the exchange. At least two weeks before the hearing, the county
auditor shall post a notice in the auditor's office and the official newspaper of the county of the
hearing that contains a description of the lands affected.

      ) (f) If real estate or personal property remains unsold after advertising for and consideration
of bids or proposals the county may employ a broker to sell the property. The broker may sell the

broker's fee shall be set by agreement with the county but may not exceed ten percent of the sale
price and must be paid from the proceeds of the sale.

general form to that provided by section 93.20 for mining leases affecting state lands. The lease
shall be for a term not exceeding 50 years, and be issued on a royalty basis, the royalty to be not less
than 25 cents per ton of 2,240 pounds, and fix a minimum amount of royalty payable during each
year, whether mineral is removed or not. Prospecting options for mining leases may be granted for
periods not exceeding one year. The options shall require, among other things, periodical showings
to the county board of the results of exploration work done.

    (­
     h­) (i) Notwithstanding anything in this subdivision to the contrary, the county may, when selling
real property owned in fee simple that cannot be improved because of noncompliance with local
ordinances regarding minimum area, shape, frontage, or access, proceed to sell the nonconforming
parcel without advertising for bid. At the county's discretion, the real property may be restricted
to sale to adjoining landowners or may be sold to any other interested party. The property shall be
sold to the highest bidder, but in no case shall the property be sold for less than 90 percent of its
fair market value as determined by the county assessor. All owners of land adjoining the land to be
sold shall be given a written notice at least 30 days before the sale. This paragraph shall be liberally
construed to encourage the sale of nonconforming real property and promote its return to the tax
roles.

estimates:
    (1) the amount of revenue exported from Minnesota to purchase and transport coal for coal-fired
electric generating plants located in Minnesota and other states that generate electricity sold at retail
in Minnesota;
    (2) the amount of electricity that would be conserved and generated by renewable energy
technology if the amount of revenue estimated in clause (1) were invested in cost-effective
electricity conservation measures and in renewable energy technologies; and
   (3) the economic impact that would be created in this state as a result of the investments made
