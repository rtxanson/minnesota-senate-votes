   Senator Parry from the Committee on State Government Innovation and Veterans, to

    S.F. No. 81: A bill for an act relating to state government; requiring a reduction in the state
workforce; creating an early retirement program; proposing coding for new law in Minnesota
Statutes, chapter 43A.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
  "Section 1. [43A.347] REDUCTION IN STATE WORK FORCE; EARLY RETIREMENT
PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Required reduction. (a) The number of full-time equivalent employees
employed in the executive branch, and the costs directly associated with employing those persons,
must be reduced by at least 15 percent by June 30, 2015, and thereafter, compared to the number of
full-time equivalent positions and the costs directly associated with those positions on July 1, 2011.
    (b) An appointing authority may use any or all of the following to achieve this requirement:
attrition, a hard hiring freeze, early retirement incentives authorized in this section, restructuring of
benefit or pension programs as authorized by other law, furloughs, and layoffs. The early retirement
program in this section is enacted as a tool to assist in complying with the required 15 percent
reduction.
   (c) For purposes of this section:
    (1) "costs directly associated" with employing people means the cost of salaries and benefits,
including the costs of employer contributions to public pension plans; and
    (2) "executive branch" does not include the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, and the
State Patrol.
    Subd. 2. Analysis. Before authorizing an early retirement under subdivision 3 or 4, the
commissioner must perform analysis, including actuarial analysis, as necessary to determine the
maximum number of employees to whom incentives will be offered, and the percentage of resulting
savings estimated to be needed to pay pension funds to cover costs to the funds of the incentive
in this section. The commissioner must use this analysis in determining how to best implement
24TH DAY]                          MONDAY, MARCH 14, 2011                                           493

this section. The commissioner may contract with the director of the Minnesota State Retirement
System for assistance in preparing the analysis required by this subdivision.
    Subd. 3. Pension early retirement incentive. (a) The commissioner of management and budget
may authorize an executive branch appointing authority to offer an early retirement incentive
under this subdivision to an employee who upon retirement would be immediately eligible to
receive an annuity from the public pension plan under which the employee is covered immediately
before separation from state service. The commissioner may establish time periods during which
the incentive may be offered and during which the incentive must be accepted, may establish
limits on the number of employees to whom an appointing authority, or all appointing authorities
collectively, may offer the incentive, and may establish other conditions for the incentive.
   (b) For an employee offered an incentive under this subdivision, for each full year of service
credit that the employee has in a plan administered by the Minnesota State Retirement System, the
Public Employees Retirement Association, or the Teachers Retirement Association, the employee
must be granted an additional month of service credit in the plan under which the employee is
covered immediately before separation from state service under this subdivision.
    (c) Upon request of an appointing authority considering offering an incentive under this
subdivision, the executive director of the public pension plan in which an employee would be
granted additional service credit under this subdivision must prepare an estimate of the present
value of the additional service credit that would be granted to an employee under this subdivision.
For each employee accepting an incentive under this subdivision, the appointing authority offering
the incentive must pay the applicable public pension plan, from the first dollars of savings achieved
through offering the incentive, the present value of the additional service credit granted to the
employee, taking into account the date payment will be received from the appointing authority.
The appointing authority must make this payment to the pension plan within one year of the date
the employee accepting the incentive leaves state service.
    Subd. 4. Insurance early retirement incentive. The commissioner of management and budget
may authorize an executive appointing authority to offer the incentive originally offered under Laws
2010, chapter 337, to employees who retire from state service during periods that the commissioner
specifies before June 30, 2015. The terms and conditions specified in Laws 2010, chapter 337, apply
to an incentive offered under this subdivision, except for the dates specified in that law for accepting
the incentive and for retiring, and except that the prohibition on reemployment or contracting is for
the period specified in this section, instead of the shorter period specified in Laws 2010, chapter 337.
   Subd. 5. Best practices. In implementing this section, the commissioner of management and
budget and affected agencies shall utilize best practices as identified by other states that have
implemented early retirement programs.
    Subd. 6. Hiring freeze. To promote streamlined government and reduced costs, no state
appointing authority may fill by outside hire a position vacated through state employee participation
in an early retirement incentive under this section.
   Subd. 7. Reemployment prohibition. An employee who receives an early retirement incentive
under this section may not be reemployed with the state or enter into a contract with the state as a
consultant for five years after termination.
   Subd. 8. Savings. Savings resulting from implementation of this section, after any payments
494                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [24TH DAY

made under subdivisions 3 and 4, must cancel back to the fund in which the savings occurred.
   Subd. 9. Not applicable to elected officials. A state elected official is not a state employee for
purposes of this section.
    Subd. 10. Application of Public Employment Labor Relations Act. Unilateral
implementation of this section, including, but not limited to, the provision of an early retirement
incentive by the appointing authority is not an unfair labor practice under chapter 179A."
  And when so amended the bill do pass and be re-referred to the Committee on Finance.
Amendments adopted. Report adopted.

   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 216B.16, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7. Energy and emission control products cost adjustment. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this chapter, the commission may permit a public utility to file rate schedules containing
provisions for the automatic adjustment of charges for public utility service in direct relation to
changes in:
   (1) federally regulated wholesale rates for energy delivered through interstate facilities;
   (2) direct costs for natural gas delivered; o
                                               ­­r
   (3) costs for fuel used in generation of electricity or the manufacture of gas; or
    (4) prudent costs incurred by a public utility for sorbents, reagents, or chemicals used to control
emissions from an electric generation facility, provided that these costs are not recovered elsewhere
in rates. The utility must track and report annually the volumes and costs of sorbents, reagents, or
chemicals using separate accounts by generating plant.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 216B.16, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 19. Multiyear rate plan. (a) A public utility may propose, and the commission may
approve, approve as modified, or reject a multiyear rate plan as provided in this subdivision. The
term "multiyear rate plan" refers to a plan establishing the rates the utility may charge for each year
of the specified period of years to be covered by the plan. The commission may approve a multiyear
rate plan only if it finds that the plan establishes just and reasonable rates for the utility, applying
the factors described in subdivision 6.
    (b) Rates charged under a multiyear rate plan must be based only upon the utility's reasonable and
prudent costs of service over the term of the plan, as determined by the commission, provided that
the costs are not being recovered elsewhere in rates. Rate adjustments authorized under subdivisions
6b and 7 may continue outside of a plan authorized under this subdivision.
    (c) The commission may, by order, establish terms, conditions, and procedures necessary to
implement this subdivision, including a mechanism to periodically examine a multiyear rate plan to
ensure rates charged under the plan remain just and reasonable. In reviewing a multiyear rate plan
proposed in a general rate case under this section, the commission may extend the time requirements
for issuance of a final determination prescribed in this section by an additional 90 days beyond its
existing authority under subdivision 2, paragraph (f)."
