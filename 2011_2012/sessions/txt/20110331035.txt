   Sec. 2. [119C.02] PARENT AWARE.
  Subdivision 1. Department of Education; request for proposal. The Department of Education
must develop a request for proposal for an organization to: (1) develop the methods used to verify,
1132                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [35TH DAY

assess, and monitor program compliance with the standards, including review of and action on
applications; (2) conduct on-site assessments; (3) develop and maintain a data quality management
system for compiling all data used to calculate program ratings and related procedures for ensuring
data quality and integrity; and (4) coordinate a system for sharing ratings and related quality
information with the public. The commissioner must consult with the Minnesota Early Learning
Foundation to design the request for proposal. Eligible responders include units of state and
local governments, nonprofit organizations, research organizations, and educational institutions.
The commissioner shall issue a request for proposal by July 30, 2011. The commissioner shall
issue a contract by October 31, 2011. The contract is valid for three years. By July 30, 2014, and
every three years thereafter, the commissioner must consult with the Minnesota Early Learning
Foundation or its designated successor organization to review and update the request for proposal.
The contract must be issued by October 31, 2014, and every three years thereafter. The Minnesota
Early Learning Foundation and its designated successor organization are consultants to the
commissioner on the request for proposal and are not eligible responders.
    Subd. 2. Criteria; measure. (a) Parent Aware must use quality ratings shown to be linked to
improving children's school readiness outcomes and must evaluate, at a minimum, how programs
perform in the following areas:
   (1) family partnerships;
   (2) tracking learning;
   (3) teacher training and education; and
   (4) teaching materials and strategies.
    (b) The commissioner must establish and regularly update the standards and indicators
that determine program quality for the quality rating system. In fiscal year 2012 and later, the
commissioner must use the Minnesota quality rating system tool in use in fiscal year 2011, the
results of the evaluations of that quality rating system, and the recommendations in the report
required under section 124D.142.
    (c) Ratings must be indicated using stars. Four stars is the best possible rating. No stars means
the program has not been rated.
     Subd. 3. Rated programs. At least twice each year, beginning June 30, 2012, the contract entity
awarded the contract in subdivision 1 must submit a list of rated programs to the commissioner. The
list of rated programs serves as the commissioner's rating. The commissioner's decision is final.
    Subd. 4. Evaluation. The commissioner shall contract with an independent private organization
to use private funds to evaluate the Parent Aware quality rating system if sufficient private funding
is available. The evaluation must incorporate rating levels and outcome-based data reflecting child
progress toward school readiness. The evaluation must also include recommendations on continued
monitoring and improvement of the correlation between rating levels and outcome-based child
progress toward school readiness. The commissioner shall make available to the independent
private organization any data requested by the organization consistent with chapter 13 and at no
cost to the organization.

less than 47 percent of the state median income;
   (2) the region's demonstrated efforts to use existing public and private resources to improve
program quality in alignment with Parent Aware quality standards;
   (3) the level of community support, especially support of the school districts, Head Start
programs, counties, and local representatives of child care centers and licensed family child care
homes; and
   (4) the demonstration of quality improvement support from local nonprofits and foundations.
   Subd. 3. Application preparation. A resource and referral organization under section 119B.19,

    Subd. 5. Parent Aware Plus regions; commissioner approval. The commissioner of education
must designate a Parent Aware region as a Parent Aware Plus region when there is a sufficient number
of programs rated for each program type. The commissioner must also consider, at a minimum, the
following criteria when designating Parent Aware Plus regions: (1) the distribution of rated programs
by eligible program type within a region; (2) the amount of funding available for scholarships in
the region; and (3) the distribution of the population of low-income preschool-aged children in the
region. The commissioner must also designate Hennepin County, the city of St. Paul, Blue Earth

those regions to continue using the existing model of the Parent Aware quality rating system in fiscal
year 2012.

commissioner may assign duties as described in subdivisions 5 and 7 to approved Parent Aware Plus
regions, as appropriate.

    (c) For the purpose of dividing the early childhood education scholarship between two or more
