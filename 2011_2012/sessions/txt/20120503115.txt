                                 REPORTS OF COMMITTEES


    Senator Limmer from the Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety, to which was
referred
   H.F. No. 322: A bill for an act relating to family law; changing certain custody and parenting time
provisions; amending Minnesota Statutes 2010, sections 257.541; 518.003, subdivision 3; 518.091;
518.131, subdivisions 1, 7; 518.155; 518.156; 518.167, subdivision 2; 518.17, subdivisions 1, 3;
518.1705, subdivisions 2, 3, 5, 9; 518.175, subdivision 1; 518.179, subdivision 1; 518.18; proposing
coding for new law in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 518; repealing Minnesota Statutes 2010, section
518.17, subdivision 2.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 518.131, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7. Guiding factors. The court shall be guided by the factors set forth in chapter 518A
(concerning child support), and sections 518.552 (concerning maintenance), 518.17 to 518.175
(concerning custody and parenting time and the presumption of minimum parenting time), and
518.14 (concerning costs and attorney fees) in making temporary orders and restraining orders.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 518.175, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. General. (a) In all proceedings for dissolution or legal separation, subsequent to
the commencement of the proceeding and continuing thereafter during the minority of the child, the
court shall, upon the request of either parent, grant such parenting time on behalf of the child and a
parent as will enable the child and the parent to maintain a child to parent relationship that will be
in the best interests of the child.
115TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MAY 3, 2012                                         6837

    If the court finds, after a hearing, that parenting time with a parent is likely to endanger the
child's physical or emotional health or impair the child's emotional development, the court shall
restrict parenting time with that parent as to time, place, duration, or supervision and may deny
parenting time entirely, as the circumstances warrant. The court shall consider the age of the child
and the child's relationship with the parent prior to the commencement of the proceeding.
   A parent's failure to pay support because of the parent's inability to do so shall not be sufficient
cause for denial of parenting time.
   (b) The court may provide that a law enforcement officer or other appropriate person will
accompany a party seeking to enforce or comply with parenting time.
    (c) Upon request of either party, to the extent practicable an order for parenting time must
include a specific schedule for parenting time, including the frequency and duration of visitation
and visitation during holidays and vacations, unless parenting time is restricted, denied, or reserved.
    (d) The court administrator shall provide a form for a pro se motion regarding parenting time
disputes, which includes provisions for indicating the relief requested, an affidavit in which the party
may state the facts of the dispute, and a brief description of the parenting time expeditor process
under section 518.1751. The form may not include a request for a change of custody. The court shall
provide instructions on serving and filing the motion.
    (e) In the absence of other evidence, there is a rebuttable presumption that a parent is entitled
to receive at least 2
                    ­5­ 35 percent of the parenting time for the child. For purposes of this paragraph,
the percentage of parenting time may be determined by calculating the number of overnights that a
child spends with a parent or by using a method other than overnights if the parent has significant
time periods on separate days when the child is in the parent's physical custody but does not stay
overnight. The court may consider the age of the child in determining whether a child is with a
parent for a significant period of time.
   Sec. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE; APPLICATION.
    (a) Section 2 is effective July 1, 2013, and applies to orders adopted or modified on or after that
date.
    (b) There must be no modification of an existing parenting time order based on the amendment
to the parenting time presumption under section 2 until July 1, 2014, unless the child's environment
presently endangers the child's physical or emotional health or impairs the child's emotional
development."
   Delete the title and insert:
   "A bill for an act relating to family law; increasing the parenting time presumption; amending
Minnesota Statutes 2010, sections 518.131, subdivision 7; 518.175, subdivision 1."
   And when so amended the bill be re-referred to the Committee on Finance without
recommendation.
   Pursuant to Joint Rule 2.03, the bill was referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration.

effective July 1, 2012, for the registration of persons who perform public or private sector
commercial or residential building construction or improvement services as described in
subdivision 2. The purpose of the pilot project is to evaluate whether the information obtained
through registration assists the Department of Labor and Industry, the Department of Employment
and Economic Development, and the Department of Revenue to enforce laws related to
misclassification of employees. The commissioner shall issue a report to the legislature no later
than January 1, 2014, on recommendations for amendments to the registration program, including
reasonable registration fees to be used to aid in enforcing misclassification laws. The commissioner
must not charge a fee for registration under the pilot project, but may take the enforcement action
specified in subdivision 8a. The pilot project shall expire on June 30, 2014, unless extended by the
legislature.

     Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.31, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Withholding tax, withholding from payments to out-of-state contractors, and
withholding by partnerships and small business corporations. (a) Except as provided in
paragraph (b), an employer or person withholding tax under section 290.92 or 290.923, subdivision
2, who fails to pay to or deposit with the commissioner a sum or sums required by those sections
to be deducted, withheld, and paid, is personally and individually liable to the state for the sum
or sums, and added penalties and interest, and is not liable to another person for that payment or
payments. The sum or sums deducted and withheld under section 290.92, subdivision 2a or 3, or
290.923, subdivision 2, must be held as a special fund in trust for the state of Minnesota.
    (b) If the employer or person withholding tax under section 290.92 or 290.923, subdivision 2,
fails to deduct and withhold the tax in violation of those sections, and later the taxes against which
the tax may be credited are paid, the tax required to be deducted and withheld will not be collected
from the employer. This does not, however, relieve the employer from liability for any penalties and
interest otherwise applicable for failure to deduct and withhold. This paragraph does not apply to

necessary to account for errors and tax base changes that affected a preliminary or final rate for either
of the two preceding years. Adjustments are allowed to the extent that the necessary information is
available to the commissioner at the time the rates for a year must be certified, and for the following
reasons:
     (1) an erroneous report of taxable value by a local official;
     (2) an erroneous calculation by the commissioner; and
    (3) an increase or decrease in taxable value for commercial-industrial or seasonal residential
recreational property reported on the abstracts of tax lists submitted under section 275.29 that was
not reported on the abstracts of assessment submitted under section 270C.89 for the same year.
The commissioner may, but need not, make adjustments if the total difference in the tax levied for
the year would be less than $100,000.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2013 and thereafter.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 275.065, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

tax levy for taxes payable in the following year. All counties with a population of more than 5,000
and home rule charter or statutory cities with a population of more than 5,000, shall also provide to
the county auditor the county or city Web site, if there is one, where the public is able to access the
budget information required to be reported under section 471.703.
    (b) On or before September 30, each school district that has not mutually agreed with its home

following year no later than October 7. The school district shall certify the proposed levy as:
   (1) a specific dollar amount by school district fund, broken down between voter-approved and
non-voter-approved levies and between referendum market value and tax capacity levies; or
   (2) the maximum levy limitation certified by the commissioner of education according to section
126C.48, subdivision 1.
    (c) If the board of estimate and taxation or any similar board that establishes maximum tax levies
for taxing jurisdictions within a first class city certifies the maximum property tax levies for funds
under its jurisdiction by charter to the county auditor by September 15, the city shall be deemed to
have certified its levies for those taxing jurisdictions.
    (d) For purposes of this section, "taxing authority" includes all home rule and statutory
cities, towns, counties, school districts, and special taxing districts as defined in section 275.066.

established under sections 123A.44 to 123A.446, and Common School Districts No. 323,
Franconia, and No. 815, Prinsburg, are also special taxing districts for purposes of this section.
    (e) At the meeting at which the taxing authority, other than a town, adopts its proposed tax levy
under paragraph (a) or (b), the taxing authority shall announce the time and place of its subsequent
regularly scheduled meetings at which the budget and levy will be discussed and at which the public
will be allowed to speak. T

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 275.065, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Notice of proposed property taxes. (a) The county auditor shall prepare and the county
treasurer shall deliver after November 10 and on or before November 24 each year, by first class
mail to each taxpayer at the address listed on the county's current year's assessment roll, a notice of
proposed property taxes. Upon written request by the taxpayer, the treasurer may send the notice in
electronic form or by electronic mail instead of on paper or by ordinary mail.
115TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MAY 3, 2012                                         6867

   (b) The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the notice.
     (c) The notice must inform taxpayers that it contains the amount of property taxes each taxing
authority proposes to collect for taxes payable the following year. In the case of a town, or in the
case of the state general tax, the final tax amount will be its proposed tax. The notice must clearly
state for each city that has a population over 500, county, school district, regional library authority
established under section 134.201, and metropolitan taxing districts as defined in paragraph (i), the
time and place of a meeting for each taxing authority in which the budget and levy will be discussed
and public input allowed, prior to the final budget and levy determination. The notice must clearly
state for each county with a population of more than 5,000 and for each city with a population
of more than 5,000 that the budget information required to be reported under section 471.703 is
available on the county or city Web site, if there is one. The taxing authorities must provide the
county auditor with the information to be included in the notice on or before the time it certifies
its proposed levy under subdivision 1. The public must be allowed to speak at that meeting, which
must occur after November 24 and must not be held before 6:00 p.m. It must provide a telephone
number for the taxing authority that taxpayers may call if they have questions related to the notice
and an address where comments will be received by mail, except that no notice required under this
section shall be interpreted as requiring the printing of a personal telephone number or address as
the contact information for a taxing authority. If a taxing authority does not maintain public offices
where telephone calls can be received by the authority, the authority may inform the county of the
lack of a public telephone number and the county shall not list a telephone number for that taxing
authority.
   (d) The notice must state for each parcel:
    (1) the market value of the property as determined under section 273.11, and used for computing
property taxes payable in the following year and for taxes payable in the current year as each appears
in the records of the county assessor on November 1 of the current year; and, in the case of residential
property, whether the property is classified as homestead or nonhomestead. The notice must clearly
inform taxpayers of the years to which the market values apply and that the values are final values;
    (2) the items listed below, shown separately by county, city or town, and state general tax, net
of the residential and agricultural homestead credit under section 273.1384, voter approved school
levy, other local school levy, and the sum of the special taxing districts, and as a total of all taxing
authorities:
   (i) the actual tax for taxes payable in the current year; and
   (ii) the proposed tax amount.
    If the county levy under clause (2) includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed
amount that a referendum is pending and that, if approved by the voters, the tax amount may be
higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, the levy for Minneapolis
6868                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [115TH DAY

Park and Recreation shall be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the
case of the city of St. Paul, the levy for the St. Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from
the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under
section 134.07 may be listed separately from the remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case
of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F
applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity
subject to the areawide tax must each be stated separately and not included in the sum of the special
taxing districts; and
   (3) the increase or decrease between the total taxes payable in the current year and the total
proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.
    For purposes of this section, the amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior
citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before
subtraction of the deferred property tax amount.
   (e) The notice must clearly state that the proposed or final taxes do not include the following:
   (1) special assessments;
    (2) levies approved by the voters after the date the proposed taxes are certified, including bond
referenda and school district levy referenda;
  (3) a levy limit increase approved by the voters by the first Tuesday after the first Monday in
November of the levy year as provided under section 275.73;
    (4) amounts necessary to pay cleanup or other costs due to a natural disaster occurring after the
date the proposed taxes are certified;
    (5) amounts necessary to pay tort judgments against the taxing authority that become final after
the date the proposed taxes are certified; and
   (6) the contamination tax imposed on properties which received market value reductions for
contamination.
    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 7, failure of the county auditor to prepare or the county
treasurer to deliver the notice as required in this section does not invalidate the proposed or final tax
levy or the taxes payable pursuant to the tax levy.
    (g) If the notice the taxpayer receives under this section lists the property as nonhomestead,
and satisfactory documentation is provided to the county assessor by the applicable deadline, and
the property qualifies for the homestead classification in that assessment year, the assessor shall
reclassify the property to homestead for taxes payable in the following year.
   (h) In the case of class 4 residential property used as a residence for lease or rental periods of 30
days or more, the taxpayer must either:
    (1) mail or deliver a copy of the notice of proposed property taxes to each tenant, renter, or
lessee; or
   (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
115TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MAY 3, 2012                                        6869

    The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of
receipt of the notice, whichever is later. A taxpayer may notify the county treasurer of the address
of the taxpayer, agent, caretaker, or manager of the premises to which the notice must be mailed in
order to fulfill the requirements of this paragraph.
    (i) For purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 6, "metropolitan special taxing districts"
means the following taxing districts in the seven-county metropolitan area that levy a property tax
for any of the specified purposes listed below:
   (1) Metropolitan Council under section 473.132, 473.167, 473.249, 473.325, 473.446, 473.521,
473.547, or 473.834;
   (2) Metropolitan Airports Commission under section 473.667, 473.671, or 473.672; and
   (3) Metropolitan Mosquito Control Commission under section 473.711.
    For purposes of this section, any levies made by the regional rail authorities in the county of
Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, or Washington under chapter 398A shall be
included with the appropriate county's levy.
    (j) The governing body of a county, city, or school district may, with the consent of the county
board, include supplemental information with the statement of proposed property taxes about
the impact of state aid increases or decreases on property tax increases or decreases and on the
level of services provided in the affected jurisdiction. This supplemental information may include
information for the following year, the current year, and for as many consecutive preceding years
as deemed appropriate by the governing body of the county, city, or school district. It may include
only information regarding:
   (1) the impact of inflation as measured by the implicit price deflator for state and local
government purchases;
   (2) population growth and decline;
   (3) state or federal government action; and
   (4) other financial factors that affect the level of property taxation and local services that the
governing body of the county, city, or school district may deem appropriate to include.
   The information may be presented using tables, written narrative, and graphic representations
and may contain instruction toward further sources of information or opportunity for comment.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2012.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 275.065, subdivision 3, is amended to read:

each city that has a population over 500, county, school district, regional library authority established
under section 134.201, and metropolitan taxing districts as defined in paragraph (i), the notice must
state the time and place of a meeting for each taxing authority in which the budget and levy will
be discussed and public input allowed, prior to the final budget and levy determination. For each
special taxing district, the notice must: (1) list separately any levy by a special taxing district that
exceeds 25 percent of the total of all special taxing district levies; and (2) provide county government
contact information where additional information may be obtained for each special taxing district.
The taxing authorities must provide the county auditor with the information to be included in the
notice on or before the time it certifies its proposed levy under subdivision 1. The public must be
allowed to speak at that meeting, which must occur after November 24 and must not be held before
6:00 p.m. It must provide a telephone number for the taxing authority that taxpayers may call if
they have questions related to the notice and an address where comments will be received by mail,
except that no notice required under this section shall be interpreted as requiring the printing of a
personal telephone number or address as the contact information for a taxing authority. If a taxing
authority does not maintain public offices where telephone calls can be received by the authority,
the authority may inform the county of the lack of a public telephone number and the county shall
not list a telephone number for that taxing authority.
    (d) The notice must state for each parcel:
    (1) the market value of the property as determined under section 273.11, and used for computing
property taxes payable in the following year and for taxes payable in the current year as each appears
in the records of the county assessor on November 1 of the current year; and, in the case of residential
property, whether the property is classified as homestead or nonhomestead. The notice must clearly
inform taxpayers of the years to which the market values apply and that the values are final values;

    (i) the actual tax for taxes payable in the current year; and
    (ii) the proposed tax amount.
    If the county levy under clause (2) includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed
amount that a referendum is pending and that, if approved by the voters, the tax amount may be
higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, the levy for Minneapolis
Park and Recreation shall be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the

case of the city of St. Paul, the levy for the St. Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from
the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under
section 134.07 may be listed separately from the remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case
of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F
applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity
subject to the areawide tax must each be stated separately and not included in the sum of the special
taxing districts; and
   (3) the increase or decrease between the total taxes payable in the current year and the total
proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.
    For purposes of this section, the amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior
citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before
subtraction of the deferred property tax amount.
   (e) The notice must clearly state that the proposed or final taxes do not include the following:
   (1) special assessments;
    (2) levies approved by the voters after the date the proposed taxes are certified, including bond
referenda and school district levy referenda;
  (3) a levy limit increase approved by the voters by the first Tuesday after the first Monday in
November of the levy year as provided under section 275.73;
    (4) amounts necessary to pay cleanup or other costs due to a natural disaster occurring after the
date the proposed taxes are certified;
    (5) amounts necessary to pay tort judgments against the taxing authority that become final after
the date the proposed taxes are certified; and
   (6) the contamination tax imposed on properties which received market value reductions for
contamination.
    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 7, failure of the county auditor to prepare or the county
treasurer to deliver the notice as required in this section does not invalidate the proposed or final tax
levy or the taxes payable pursuant to the tax levy.
    (g) If the notice the taxpayer receives under this section lists the property as nonhomestead,
and satisfactory documentation is provided to the county assessor by the applicable deadline, and
the property qualifies for the homestead classification in that assessment year, the assessor shall
reclassify the property to homestead for taxes payable in the following year.
   (h) In the case of class 4 residential property used as a residence for lease or rental periods of 30
days or more, the taxpayer must either:
    (1) mail or deliver a copy of the notice of proposed property taxes to each tenant, renter, or
lessee; or
   (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
   The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of

Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, or Washington under chapter 398A shall be
included with the appropriate county's levy.
    (j) The governing body of a county, city, or school district may, with the consent of the county
board, include supplemental information with the statement of proposed property taxes about
the impact of state aid increases or decreases on property tax increases or decreases and on the
level of services provided in the affected jurisdiction. This supplemental information may include
information for the following year, the current year, and for as many consecutive preceding years
as deemed appropriate by the governing body of the county, city, or school district. It may include
only information regarding:
   (1) the impact of inflation as measured by the implicit price deflator for state and local
government purchases;
   (2) population growth and decline;
   (3) state or federal government action; and
   (4) other financial factors that affect the level of property taxation and local services that the

statements. The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the property tax statement and
its contents. The tax statement must not state or imply that property tax credits are paid by the state of
Minnesota. The statement must contain a tabulated statement of the dollar amount due to each taxing

any levies made by the regional rail authorities in the county of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin,
Ramsey, Scott, or Washington under chapter 398A shall be listed on a separate line directly under
the appropriate county's levy, and (2) any levy by a special taxing district that exceeds 25 percent
of the total of all special taxing district levies on a tax statement must be separately stated. If the
county levy under this paragraph includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount. In the case of Ramsey County, if the county levy
under this paragraph includes an amount for public library service under section 134.07, the amount
attributable for that purpose may be separated from the remaining county levy amount. The amount
of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior citizens' property tax deferral program under
chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before subtraction of the deferred property tax
amount. The amount of the tax on contamination value imposed under sections 270.91 to 270.98, if
any, must also be separately stated. The dollar amounts, including the dollar amount of any special
assessments, may be rounded to the nearest even whole dollar. For purposes of this section whole
odd-numbered dollars may be adjusted to the next higher even-numbered dollar. The amount of
market value excluded under section 273.11, subdivision 16, if any, must also be listed on the tax
statement.
   (b) The property tax statements for manufactured homes and sectional structures taxed as
personal property shall contain the same information that is required on the tax statements for real
property.
   (c) Real and personal property tax statements must contain the following information in the order
given in this paragraph. The information must contain the current year tax information in the right
column with the corresponding information for the previous year in a column on the left:
   (1) the property's estimated market value under section 273.11, subdivision 1;
   (2) the property's homestead market value exclusion under section 273.13, subdivision 35;
   (3) the property's taxable market value after reductions under sections 273.11, subdivisions 1a
and 16, and 273.13, subdivision 35;
   (4) the property's gross tax, before credits;
   (5) for homestead agricultural properties, the credit under section 273.1384;
    (6) any credits received under sections 273.119; 273.1234 or 273.1235; 273.135; 273.1391;
273.1398, subdivision 4; 469.171; and 473H.10, except that the amount of credit received under
section 273.135 must be separately stated and identified as "taconite tax relief"; and
   (7) the net tax payable in the manner required in paragraph (a).
    (d) If the county uses envelopes for mailing property tax statements and if the county agrees, a
taxing district may include a notice with the property tax statement notifying taxpayers when the
taxing district will begin its budget deliberations for the current year, and encouraging taxpayers
to attend the hearings. If the county allows notices to be included in the envelope containing the
property tax statement, and if more than one taxing district relative to a given property decides to
include a notice with the tax statement, the county treasurer or auditor must coordinate the process

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290A.04, subdivision 2h, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2h. Additional refund. (a) If the gross property taxes payable on a homestead increase
more than 12 percent over the property taxes payable in the prior year on the same property that is
owned and occupied by the same owner on January 2 of both years, and the amount of that increase
is $100 or more, a claimant who is a homeowner shall be allowed an additional refund equal to 6  ­­0
75 percent of the amount of the increase over the greater of 12 percent of the prior year's property
taxes payable or $100. This subdivision shall not apply to any increase in the gross property taxes
payable attributable to improvements made to the homestead after the assessment date for the prior
year's taxes. This subdivision shall not apply to any increase in the gross property taxes payable
attributable to the termination of valuation exclusions under section 273.11, subdivision 16.
   The maximum refund allowed under this subdivision is $1,000.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision "gross property taxes payable" means property taxes payable
determined without regard to the refund allowed under this subdivision.
    (c) In addition to the other proofs required by this chapter, each claimant under this subdivision
shall file with the property tax refund return a copy of the property tax statement for taxes payable
in the preceding year or other documents required by the commissioner.
    (d) Upon request, the appropriate county official shall make available the names and addresses of
the property taxpayers who may be eligible for the additional property tax refund under this section.
The information shall be provided on a magnetic computer disk. The county may recover its costs
by charging the person requesting the information the reasonable cost for preparing the data. The
information may not be used for any purpose other than for notifying the homeowner of potential
eligibility and assisting the homeowner, without charge, in preparing a refund claim.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective beginning with refunds based on taxes payable
in 2013.

current budget year.
    (b) The governmental funds included in the budget information required under this section shall
include the municipality's general fund, debt service fund, and special revenue funds, except for
special revenue funds specifically used for the acquisition and construction of major capital facilities.
The reported information shall also exclude enterprise funds and fiduciary funds.

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116J.8737, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Credit allowed. (a) A qualified investor or qualified fund is eligible for a credit equal
to 25 percent of the qualified investment in a qualified small business. Investments made by a
pass-through entity qualify for a credit only if the entity is a qualified fund. The commissioner must
not allocate more than $11,000,000 in credits to qualified investors or qualified funds for taxable
years beginning after December 31, 2009, and before January 1, 2011, ­       an

           ­0­­
              15­ 2012, must not allocate more than $16,500,000 in credits per year for taxable years
beginning after December 31, 2011, and before January 1, 2013, and must not allocate more than
$17,000,000 in credits per year for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, and before
January 1, 2015. Any portion of a taxable year's credits that is not allocated by the commissioner
does not cancel and may be carried forward to subsequent taxable years until all credits have been
allocated.
    (b) The commissioner may not allocate more than a total maximum amount in credits for
a taxable year to a qualified investor for the investor's cumulative qualified investments as an
individual qualified investor and as an investor in a qualified fund; for married couples filing
joint returns the maximum is $250,000, and for all other filers the maximum is $125,000. The
commissioner may not allocate more than a total of $1,000,000 in credits over all taxable years for
qualified investments in any one qualified small business.
    (c) The commissioner may not allocate a credit to a qualified investor either as an individual
qualified investor or as an investor in a qualified fund if the investor receives more than 50 percent
of the investor's gross annual income from the qualified small business in which the qualified
investment is proposed. A member of the family of an individual disqualified by this paragraph is
not eligible for a credit under this section. For a married couple filing a joint return, the limitations
in this paragraph apply collectively to the investor and spouse. For purposes of determining the
ownership interest of an investor under this paragraph, the rules under section 267(c) and 267(e) of
the Internal Revenue Code apply.
   (d) Applications for tax credits for 2010 must be made available on the department's Web site by
September 1, 2010, and the department must begin accepting applications by September 1, 2010.
Applications for subsequent years must be made available by November 1 of the preceding year.
   (e) Qualified investors and qualified funds must apply to the commissioner for tax credits. Tax
credits must be allocated to qualified investors or qualified funds in the order that the tax credit
request applications are filed with the department. The commissioner must approve or reject tax
credit request applications within 15 days of receiving the application. The investment specified in

the application must be made within 60 days of the allocation of the credits. If the investment is not
made within 60 days, the credit allocation is canceled and available for reallocation. A qualified
investor or qualified fund that fails to invest as specified in the application, within 60 days of
allocation of the credits, must notify the commissioner of the failure to invest within five business
days of the expiration of the 60-day investment period.
    (f) All tax credit request applications filed with the department on the same day must be treated
as having been filed contemporaneously. If two or more qualified investors or qualified funds file
tax credit request applications on the same day, and the aggregate amount of credit allocation claims
exceeds the aggregate limit of credits under this section or the lesser amount of credits that remain
unallocated on that day, then the credits must be allocated among the qualified investors or qualified
funds who filed on that day on a pro rata basis with respect to the amounts claimed. The pro rata
allocation for any one qualified investor or qualified fund is the product obtained by multiplying
a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the credit allocation claim filed on behalf of a
qualified investor and the denominator of which is the total of all credit allocation claims filed on
behalf of all applicants on that day, by the amount of credits that remain unallocated on that day for
the taxable year.
    (g) A qualified investor or qualified fund, or a qualified small business acting on their behalf,
must notify the commissioner when an investment for which credits were allocated has been made,
and the taxable year in which the investment was made. A qualified fund must also provide the
commissioner with a statement indicating the amount invested by each investor in the qualified
fund based on each investor's share of the assets of the qualified fund at the time of the qualified
investment. After receiving notification that the investment was made, the commissioner must issue
credit certificates for the taxable year in which the investment was made to the qualified investor or,
for an investment made by a qualified fund, to each qualified investor who is an investor in the fund.
The certificate must state that the credit is subject to revocation if the qualified investor or qualified
fund does not hold the investment in the qualified small business for at least three years, consisting
of the calendar year in which the investment was made and the two following years. The three-year
holding period does not apply if:
    (1) the investment by the qualified investor or qualified fund becomes worthless before the end
of the three-year period;
    (2) 80 percent or more of the assets of the qualified small business is sold before the end of the
three-year period;
   (3) the qualified small business is sold before the end of the three-year period; or
   (4) the qualified small business's common stock begins trading on a public exchange before the
end of the three-year period.
    (h) The commissioner must notify the commissioner of revenue of credit certificates issued under
this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2011.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116J.8737, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 5a. Promotion of credit in greater Minnesota. (a) By July 1, 2012, the commissioner

shall develop a plan to increase awareness of and use of the credit for investments in greater
Minnesota businesses with a target goal that a minimum of 30 percent of the credit will be awarded
for those investments during the second half of calendar year 2013 and for each full calendar year
thereafter. Beginning with the legislative report due on March 15, 2013, under subdivision 9, the
commissioner shall report on its plan under this subdivision and the results achieved.
    (b) If the target goal of 30 percent under paragraph (a) is not achieved for the six-month period
ending on December 31, 2013, the credit percentage under subdivision 5, paragraph (a), is increased
to 40 percent for a qualified investment made after December 31, 2013, in a greater Minnesota
business. This paragraph does not apply and the credit percentage for all qualified investments is
the rate provided under subdivision 5 for any calendar year beginning after a calendar year for which
the commissioner determines the 30 percent target has been satisfied. The commissioner shall timely
post notification of changes in the credit rate under this paragraph on the department's website.
   (c) For purposes of this section, a "greater Minnesota business" means a qualified small business

    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.31, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Withholding tax, withholding from payments to out-of-state contractors, and
withholding by partnerships and small business corporations. (a) Except as provided in
paragraph (b), an employer or person withholding tax under section 290.92 or 290.923, subdivision
2, who fails to pay to or deposit with the commissioner a sum or sums required by those sections
to be deducted, withheld, and paid, is personally and individually liable to the state for the sum
or sums, and added penalties and interest, and is not liable to another person for that payment or
payments. The sum or sums deducted and withheld under section 290.92, subdivision 2a or 3, or
290.923, subdivision 2, must be held as a special fund in trust for the state of Minnesota.
    (b) If the employer or person withholding tax under section 290.92 or 290.923, subdivision 2,
fails to deduct and withhold the tax in violation of those sections, and later the taxes against which
the tax may be credited are paid, the tax required to be deducted and withheld will not be collected
from the employer. This does not, however, relieve the employer from liability for any penalties and
interest otherwise applicable for failure to deduct and withhold. This paragraph does not apply to
an employer subject to paragraph (g), ­o­­ t­ ­

taxable years is $50,000.
    (e) For members of a unitary business whose income and factors are included on a combined

determined at the group level.
   Subd. 3. Allocation of credits. (a) By July 1, 2012, the commissioner shall develop an Internet
application that allows employers to apply for tentative credits. The application must include the
employer's name, tax identification number, and North American Industry Classification System
industry code, and the name and date of hire of the employee.
    (b) The credit is available only to employers who apply for a tentative credit using the application
in paragraph (a) and who receive notice that their application has been approved for a tentative
credit.
    (c) Employers may apply for a tentative credit no earlier than the date of hire of each qualified
full-time employee. Any employer may file more than one tentative credit application, but no
employer may apply for tentative credits for more than a total of 16 employees hired in 2012 or 33

been applied for.
  Subd. 4. Tentative credits for construction trades employers. (a) Any construction trades
employer may apply for a tentative credit.
    (b) To remain eligible for a credit, a construction trades employer who has received a tentative
credit must renew the tentative credit by filing an application with the commissioner no earlier than
180 days after date of hire and no more than 210 days after date of hire. The renewal notice must
state that the employee for whom the tentative credit was originally granted is still an employee and
that the employer reasonably believes that all qualifications of eligibility for a credit will be met.
    (c) Any tentative credit issued to a construction trades employer that is not renewed within the
time required for renewal is canceled. Any canceled tentative credits are available to be reissued by
the commissioner to employers under subdivision 3.

as a partnership, S corporation, or multiple owners of a business are passed through to the partners,

   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.174, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Redevelopment district. (a) "Redevelopment district" means a type of tax increment
financing district consisting of a project, or portions of a project, within which the authority finds
by resolution that one or more of the following conditions, reasonably distributed throughout the
district, exists:
    (1) parcels consisting of 70 percent of the area of the district are occupied by buildings, streets,
utilities, paved or gravel parking lots, or other similar structures and m­o

of the buildings, not including outbuildings, are structurally substandard to a degree requiring
substantial renovation or clearance;
    (2) the property consists of vacant, unused, underused, inappropriately used, or infrequently used
rail yards, rail storage facilities, or excessive or vacated railroad rights-of-way;
   (3) tank facilities, or property whose immediately previous use was for tank facilities, as defined
115TH DAY]                           THURSDAY, MAY 3, 2012                                          6917

in section 115C.02, subdivision 15, if the tank facilities:
   (i) have or had a capacity of more than 1,000,000 gallons;
   (ii) are located adjacent to rail facilities; and
   (iii) have been removed or are unused, underused, inappropriately used, or infrequently used; or
   (4) a qualifying disaster area, as defined in subdivision 10b.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, "structurally substandard" shall mean containing defects
in structural elements or a combination of deficiencies in essential utilities and facilities, light and
ventilation, fire protection including adequate egress, layout and condition of interior partitions, or
similar factors, which defects or deficiencies are of sufficient total significance to justify substantial
renovation or clearance.
    (c) A building is not structurally substandard if it is in compliance with the building code
applicable to new buildings or could be modified to satisfy the building code at a cost of less than
15 percent of the cost of constructing a new structure of the same square footage and type on
the site. The municipality may find that a building is not disqualified as structurally substandard
under the preceding sentence on the basis of reasonably available evidence, such as the size,
type, and age of the building, the average cost of plumbing, electrical, or structural repairs, or
other similar reliable evidence. The municipality may not make such a determination without an
interior inspection of the property, but need not have an independent, expert appraisal prepared of
the cost of repair and rehabilitation of the building. An interior inspection of the property is not
required, if the municipality finds that (1) the municipality or authority is unable to gain access to
the property after using its best efforts to obtain permission from the party that owns or controls
the property; and (2) the evidence otherwise supports a reasonable conclusion that the building
is structurally substandard. Items of evidence that support such a conclusion include recent fire
or police inspections, on-site property tax appraisals or housing inspections, exterior evidence
of deterioration, or other similar reliable evidence. Written documentation of the findings and
reasons why an interior inspection was not conducted must be made and retained under section
469.175, subdivision 3, clause (1). Failure of a building to be disqualified under the provisions
of this paragraph is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition to determining that the building is
substandard.
    (d) A parcel is deemed to be occupied by a structurally substandard building for purposes of the
finding under paragraph (a) or by the improvements described in paragraph (e) if all of the following
conditions are met:
    (1) the parcel was occupied by a substandard building or met the requirements of paragraph (e),
as the case may be, within three years of the filing of the request for certification of the parcel as
part of the district with the county auditor;
    (2) the substandard building or the improvements described in paragraph (e) were demolished
or removed by the authority or the demolition or removal was financed by the authority or was done
by a developer under a development agreement with the authority;
    (3) the authority found by resolution before the demolition or removal that the parcel was
occupied by a structurally substandard building or met the requirements of paragraph (e) and that
after demolition and clearance the authority intended to include the parcel within a district; and

    (4) upon filing the request for certification of the tax capacity of the parcel as part of a district,
the authority notifies the county auditor that the original tax capacity of the parcel must be adjusted
as provided by section 469.177, subdivision 1, paragraph (f).
    (e) For purposes of this subdivision, a parcel is not occupied by buildings, streets, utilities, paved
or gravel parking lots, or other similar structures unless 15 percent of the area of the parcel contains
buildings, streets, utilities, paved or gravel parking lots, or other similar structures.
    (f) For districts consisting of two or more noncontiguous areas, each area must qualify as a
redevelopment district under paragraph (a) to be included in the district, and the entire area of the
district must satisfy paragraph (a).

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.175, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Municipality approval. (a) A county auditor shall not certify the original net tax
capacity of a tax increment financing district until the tax increment financing plan proposed for
that district has been approved by the municipality in which the district is located. If an authority
that proposes to establish a tax increment financing district and the municipality are not the same,
the authority shall apply to the municipality in which the district is proposed to be located and shall
obtain the approval of its tax increment financing plan by the municipality before the authority may
use tax increment financing. The municipality shall approve the tax increment financing plan only
after a public hearing thereon after published notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the
municipality at least once not less than ten days nor more than 30 days prior to the date of the
hearing. The published notice must include a map of the area of the district from which increments
may be collected and, if the project area includes additional area, a map of the project area in which
the increments may be expended. The hearing may be held before or after the approval or creation
of the project or it may be held in conjunction with a hearing to approve the project.
    (b) Before or at the time of approval of the tax increment financing plan, the municipality shall
make the following findings, and shall set forth in writing the reasons and supporting facts for each
determination:
    (1) that the proposed tax increment financing district is a redevelopment district, a renewal
or renovation district, a housing district, a soils condition district, soil deficiency district, or an
economic development district; if the proposed district is a redevelopment district or a renewal or
renovation district, the reasons and supporting facts for the determination that the district meets the
criteria of section 469.174, subdivision 10, paragraph (a), clauses (1) and (2), or subdivision 10a,
must be documented in writing and retained and made available to the public by the authority until
the district has been terminated;
   (2) that, in the opinion of the municipality:
    (i) the proposed development or redevelopment would not reasonably be expected to occur solely
through private investment within the reasonably foreseeable future; and
    (ii) the increased market value of the site that could reasonably be expected to occur without the
use of tax increment financing would be less than the increase in the market value estimated to result
from the proposed development after subtracting the present value of the projected tax increments
for the maximum duration of the district permitted by the plan. The requirements of this item do not
apply if the district is a housing district;
   (3) that the tax increment financing plan conforms to the general plan for the development or
redevelopment of the municipality as a whole;
   (4) that the tax increment financing plan will afford maximum opportunity, consistent with the
6920                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [115TH DAY

sound needs of the municipality as a whole, for the development or redevelopment of the project by
private enterprise;
   (5) that the municipality elects the method of tax increment computation set forth in section
469.177, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), if applicable; and
    (6) that for a redevelopment district, renewal and renovation district, soils condition district,
or soil deficiency district established by the authority in a mining reclamation project area, the
reasons and supporting facts for the determination that the mining reclamation project area meets the
requirements under section 469.174, subdivision 30, must be documented in writing and retained
and made available to the public by the authority until two years after the district is decertified.
These findings must have been made and documented no more than ten years before approval of
the tax increment financing plan for the district.
    (c) When the municipality and the authority are not the same, the municipality shall approve or
disapprove the tax increment financing plan within 60 days of submission by the authority. When
the municipality and the authority are not the same, the municipality may not amend or modify a
tax increment financing plan except as proposed by the authority pursuant to subdivision 4. Once
approved, the determination of the authority to undertake the project through the use of tax increment
financing and the resolution of the governing body shall be conclusive of the findings therein and
of the public need for the financing.
  (d) For a district that is subject to the requirements of paragraph (b), clause (2), item (ii), the
municipality's statement of reasons and supporting facts must include all of the following:
    (1) an estimate of the amount by which the market value of the site will increase without the use
of tax increment financing;
   (2) an estimate of the increase in the market value that will result from the development or
redevelopment to be assisted with tax increment financing; and
   (3) the present value of the projected tax increments for the maximum duration of the district
permitted by the tax increment financing plan.
   (e) For purposes of this subdivision, "site" means the parcels on which the development or
redevelopment to be assisted with tax increment financing will be located.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for districts for which the request for certification
is made after April 30, 2012.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.176, subdivision 1b, is amended to read:
   Subd. 1b. Duration limits; terms. (a) No tax increment shall in any event be paid to the
authority:
    (1) after 15 years after receipt by the authority of the first increment for a renewal and renovation
district;
    (2) after 20 years after receipt by the authority of the first increment for a soils condition district
or a soil deficiency district;
   (3) after eight years after receipt by the authority of the first increment for an economic

development district;
   (4) for a housing district, a compact development district, or a redevelopment district, after 25
years from the date of receipt by the authority of the first increment.
    (b) For purposes of determining a duration limit under this subdivision or subdivision 1e that
is based on the receipt of an increment, any increments from taxes payable in the year in which
the district terminates shall be paid to the authority. This paragraph does not affect a duration limit
calculated from the date of approval of the tax increment financing plan or based on the recovery of
costs or to a duration limit under subdivision 1c. This paragraph does not supersede the restrictions
on payment of delinquent taxes in subdivision 1f.
    (c) An action by the authority to waive or decline to accept an increment has no effect for
purposes of computing a duration limit based on the receipt of increment under this subdivision
or any other provision of law. The authority is deemed to have received an increment for any year
in which it waived or declined to accept an increment, regardless of whether the increment was paid
to the authority.
    (d) Receipt by a hazardous substance subdistrict of an increment as a result of a reduction in
original net tax capacity under section 469.174, subdivision 7, paragraph (b), does not constitute
receipt of increment by the overlying district for the purpose of calculating the duration limit under
this section.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for districts for which the request for certification
is made after April 30, 2012.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.176, subdivision 4b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4b. Soils condition districts. Revenue derived from Tax increment from a soils
condition district may be used only to (1) acquire parcels on which the improvements described
in clause (2) will occur; (2) pay for the cost of removal or remedial action; and (3) pay for the
administrative expenses of the authority allocable to the district, including the cost of preparation of
the development action response plan. For a soils condition district located in a mining reclamation
project area, tax increments may also be expended on the additional cost of public improvements
directly caused by the removal or remedial action and located within the mining reclamation
project area.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for districts for which the request for certification
is made after April 30, 2012.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 469.176, subdivision 4c, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 4c. Economic development districts. (a) Revenue derived from tax increment from
an economic development district may not be used to provide improvements, loans, subsidies,
grants, interest rate subsidies, or assistance in any form to developments consisting of buildings
and ancillary facilities, if more than 15 percent of the buildings and facilities (determined on the
basis of square footage) are used for a purpose other than:
    (1) the manufacturing or production of tangible personal property, including processing resulting
in the change in condition of the property;
6922                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [115TH DAY

   (2) warehousing, storage, and distribution of tangible personal property, excluding retail sales;
   (3) research and development related to the activities listed in clause (1) or (2);
   (4) telemarketing if that activity is the exclusive use of the property;
   (5) tourism facilities;
   (6) qualified border retail facilities; or
   (7) space necessary for and related to the activities listed in clauses (1) to (6).
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, revenues derived from tax increment
from an economic development district may be used to provide improvements, loans, subsidies,
grants, interest rate subsidies, or assistance in any form for up to 15,000 square feet of any
separately owned commercial facility located within the municipal jurisdiction of a small city, if the
revenues derived from increments are spent only to assist the facility directly or for administrative
expenses, the assistance is necessary to develop the facility, and all of the increments, except those
for administrative expenses, are spent only for activities within the district.
   (c) A city is a small city for purposes of this subdivision if the city was a small city in the year in
which the request for certification was made and applies for the rest of the duration of the district,
regardless of whether the city qualifies or ceases to qualify as a small city.
   (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) and the finding requirements of section
469.174, subdivision 12, tax increments from an economic development district may be used to
provide improvements, loans, subsidies, grants, interest rate subsidies, or assistance in any form to
developments consisting of buildings and ancillary facilities, if all the following conditions are met:

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
all tax increment financing districts, regardless of when the request for certification was made.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.176, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 4n. Soil deficiency district. Tax increments from a soil deficiency district may only be
used to pay for the following costs for activities located within the mining reclamation project area:
   (1) acquisition of parcels on which the improvements described in clause (2) will occur;
    (2) the cost of correcting the unusual terrain or soil deficiencies and the additional cost of
installing public improvements directly caused by the deficiencies;
   (3) administrative expenses of the authority allocable to the district; and
    (4) costs described in subdivision 4j for the district, if these payments do not exceed 25 percent
of the tax increment from the district.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for districts for which the request for certification
is made after April 30, 2012.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 469.1763, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 2. Expenditures outside district. (a) For each tax increment financing district, an amount
6924                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [115TH DAY

equal to at least 75 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments paid by properties in the
district must be expended on activities in the district or to pay bonds, to the extent that the proceeds
of the bonds were used to finance activities in the district or to pay, or secure payment of, debt service
on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment districts for which the request for
certification was made after June 30, 1995, the in-district percentage for purposes of the preceding
sentence is 80 percent. Not more than 25 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments
paid by properties in the district may be expended, through a development fund or otherwise, on
activities outside of the district but within the defined geographic area of the project except to pay,
or secure payment of, debt service on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment
districts for which the request for certification was made after June 30, 1995, the pooling percentage
for purposes of the preceding sentence is 20 percent. The revenue derived from tax increments for
the district that are expended on costs under section 469.176, subdivision 4h, paragraph (b), may
be deducted first before calculating the percentages that must be expended within and without the
district.
    (b) In the case of a housing district, a housing project, as defined in section 469.174, subdivision
11, is an activity in the district.
    (c) All administrative expenses are for activities outside of the district, except that if the only
expenses for activities outside of the district under this subdivision are for the purposes described
in paragraph (d), administrative expenses will be considered as expenditures for activities in the
district.
    (d) The authority may elect, in the tax increment financing plan for the district, to increase by
up to ten percentage points the permitted amount of expenditures for activities located outside the
geographic area of the district under paragraph (a). As permitted by section 469.176, subdivision
4k, the expenditures, including the permitted expenditures under paragraph (a), need not be made
within the geographic area of the project. Expenditures that meet the requirements of this paragraph
are legally permitted expenditures of the district, notwithstanding section 469.176, subdivisions 4b,
4c, 4d, and 4j. To qualify for the increase under this paragraph, the expenditures must:
   (1) be used exclusively to assist housing that
    (i) meets the requirement for a qualified low-income building, as that term is used in section 42
of the Internal Revenue Code; ­ an

    (e) For a district created within a biotechnology and health sciences industry zone as defined in
section 469.330, subdivision 6, or for an existing district located within such a zone, tax increment
derived from such a district may be expended outside of the district but within the zone only
for expenditures required for the construction of public infrastructure necessary to support the
activities of the zone, land acquisition, and other redevelopment costs as defined in section 469.176,
subdivision 4j. These expenditures are considered as expenditures for activities within the district.
   (f) The authority under paragraph (d), clause ­ (4

may continue to be expended under this authority after that date, if they are used to pay bonds or
binding contracts that would qualify under subdivision 3, paragraph (a), if December 31, 2016, is
considered to be the last date of the five-year period after certification under that provision.
    (g) The authority may elect, in the tax increment financing plan, for a district located in a mining
reclamation area that "activities within the district" under paragraph (a) includes activities within
the geographic area of the mining reclamation area.

of Minnesota Statutes, section 469.1763, regardless of when the request for certification was made,
except the amendment adding paragraph (g) is effective for districts for which the request for
certification was made after April 30, 2012.
     Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.1763, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. Five-year rule. (a) Revenues derived from tax increments are considered to have been
expended on an activity within the district under subdivision 2 only if one of the following occurs:
    (1) before or within five years after certification of the district, the revenues are actually paid to
a third party with respect to the activity;
    (2) bonds, the proceeds of which must be used to finance the activity, are issued and sold to a
third party before or within five years after certification, the revenues are spent to repay the bonds,
and the proceeds of the bonds either are, on the date of issuance, reasonably expected to be spent
before the end of the later of (i) the five-year period, or (ii) a reasonable temporary period within

    (3) During the decedent's taxable year that ended before the decedent's death, the trade or
business must not have been a passive activity within the meaning of section 469(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code and the decedent or the decedent's spouse must have materially participated in the
trade or business within the meaning of section 469(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, excluding

an interest in the qualified property.
    (b) The amount of the additional tax equals the amount of the exclusion claimed with respect to
the qualified interest disposed of by the estate under subdivision 8, paragraph (d), multiplied by 16
percent.

115TH DAY]                              THURSDAY, MAY 3, 2012                                               6933

swimming pool, exercise room or health spa), unless the building is part of an outdoor park facility
and is incidental to the primary purpose of outdoor recreation.

    (1) the federal decennial census,
    (2) a special census conducted under contract by the United States Bureau of the Census, or
   (3) a population estimate made either by the Metropolitan Council or by the state demographer

    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 373.40, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Application of election requirement. (a) Bonds issued by a county to finance
capital improvements under an approved capital improvement plan are not subject to the election
requirements of section 375.18 or 475.58. The bonds must be approved by vote of at least
three-fifths of the members of the county board. In the case of a metropolitan county, the bonds
must be approved by vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the county board.
     (b) Before issuance of bonds qualifying under this section, the county must publish a notice of
its intention to issue the bonds and the date and time of a hearing to obtain public comment on the
matter. The notice must be published in the official newspaper of the county or in a newspaper of
general circulation in the county. The notice must be published at least 14, but not more than 28,
days before the date of the hearing.
    (c) A county may issue the bonds only upon obtaining the approval of a majority of the voters
voting on the question of issuing the obligations, if a petition requesting a vote on the issuance is
signed by voters equal to five percent of the votes cast in the county in the last county general election
and is filed with the county auditor within 30 days after the public hearing. T          ­h e­

elects not to submit the question to the voters, the county shall not propose the issuance of bonds
under this section for the same purpose and in the same amount for a period of 365 days from the
date of receipt of the petition. If the question of issuing the bonds is submitted and not approved by
the voters, the provisions of section 475.58, subdivision 1a, apply.
     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 373.40, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Limitations on amount. A county may not issue bonds under this section if the
maximum amount of principal and interest to become due in any year on all the outstanding bonds
issued pursuant to this section (including the bonds to be issued) will equal or exceed 0.12 percent
of taxable market value of property in the county. Calculation of the limit must be made using
the taxable market value for the taxes payable year in which the obligations are issued and sold,
provided that, for purposes of determining the principal and interest due in any year, the county
may deduct the amount of interest expected to be paid or reimbursed to the county by the federal
government in that year on any outstanding bonds or the bonds to be issued. This section does not
limit the authority to issue bonds under any other special or general law.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 474A.02, subdivision 23a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23a. Qualified bonds. "Qualified bonds" means the specific type or types of obligations
that are subject to the annual volume cap. Qualified bonds include the following types of obligations
as defined in federal tax law:
     (a) "public facility bonds" means "exempt facility bonds" as defined in federal tax law, except
for residential rental project bonds,             ­w ­h ­­c

    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 475.521, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Election requirement. (a) Bonds issued by a municipality to finance capital
improvements under an approved capital improvements plan are not subject to the election
requirements of section 475.58. The bonds must be approved by an affirmative vote of three-fifths
of the members of a five-member governing body. In the case of a governing body having more or
less than five members, the bonds must be approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the members
of the governing body.
    (b) Before the issuance of bonds qualifying under this section, the municipality must publish
a notice of its intention to issue the bonds and the date and time of the hearing to obtain public
comment on the matter. The notice must be published in the official newspaper of the municipality
or in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality. Additionally, the notice may be posted
on the official Web site, if any, of the municipality. The notice must be published at least 14 but not
more than 28 days before the date of the hearing.
     (c) A municipality may issue the bonds only after obtaining the approval of a majority of the
voters voting on the question of issuing the obligations, if a petition requesting a vote on the issuance
is signed by voters equal to five percent of the votes cast in the municipality in the last municipal
general election and is filed with the clerk within 30 days after the public hearing. T   ­h e­

municipality elects not to submit the question to the voters, the municipality shall not propose the
issuance of bonds under this section for the same purpose and in the same amount for a period of
365 days from the date of receipt of the petition. If the question of issuing the bonds is submitted
and not approved by the voters, the provisions of section 475.58, subdivision 1a, apply.
    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 475.521, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Limitations on amount. A municipality may not issue bonds under this section if the
maximum amount of principal and interest to become due in any year on all the outstanding bonds
issued under this section, including the bonds to be issued, will equal or exceed 0.16 percent of the
taxable market value of property in the municipality. Calculation of the limit must be made using
the taxable market value for the taxes payable year in which the obligations are issued and sold,
provided that, for purposes of determining the principal and interest due in any year, the municipality
may deduct the amount of interest expected to be paid or reimbursed to the municipality by the
federal government in that year on any outstanding bonds or the bonds to be issued. In the case of a
municipality with a population of 2,500 or more, the bonds are subject to the net debt limits under
section 475.53. In the case of a shared facility in which more than one municipality participates,
upon compliance by each participating municipality with the requirements of subdivision 2, the
limitations in this subdivision and the net debt represented by the bonds shall be allocated to each
participating municipality in proportion to its required financial contribution to the financing of the
shared facility, as set forth in the joint powers agreement relating to the shared facility. This section

conditions are met:
    (1) the streets are reconstructed under a street reconstruction plan that describes the street
reconstruction to be financed, the estimated costs, and any planned reconstruction of other streets
in the municipality over the next five years, and the plan and issuance of the obligations has been
approved by a vote of all of the members of the governing body present at the meeting following a
public hearing for which notice has been published in the official newspaper at least ten days but
not more than 28 days prior to the hearing; and
    (2) if a petition requesting a vote on the issuance is signed by voters equal to five percent of the
votes cast in the last municipal general election and is filed with the municipal clerk within 30 days
of the public hearing, the municipality may issue the bonds only after obtaining the approval of a
majority of the voters voting on the question of the issuance of the obligations. If the municipality
elects not to submit the question to the voters, the municipality shall not propose the issuance of
bonds under this section for the same purpose and in the same amount for a period of 365 days from
the date of receipt of the petition. If the question of issuing the bonds is submitted and not approved
by the voters, the provisions of subdivision 1a, apply.
    (b) Obligations issued under this subdivision are subject to the debt limit of the municipality and
are not excluded from net debt under section 475.51, subdivision 4.
    (c) For purposes of this subdivision, street reconstruction includes utility replacement
and relocation and other activities incidental to the street reconstruction, turn lanes and other
improvements having a substantial public safety function, realignments, other modifications to
intersect with state and county roads, and the local share of state and county road projects.
    (d) Except in the case of turn lanes, safety improvements, realignments, intersection
modifications, and the local share of state and county road projects, street reconstruction does not
include the portion of project cost allocable to widening a street or adding curbs and gutters where
none previously existed.

Firetown Premium Reports filed under this chapter to each municipality and/or firefighters relief
association.
    (b) The commissioner shall calculate an initial fire state aid allocation amount for each
municipality or fire department under paragraph (c) and a minimum fire state aid allocation amount
for each municipality or fire department under paragraph (d). The municipality or fire department
must receive the larger fire state aid amount.
    (c) The initial fire state aid allocation amount is the amount available for apportionment as
fire state aid under subdivision 5, without inclusion of any additional funding amount to support
a minimum fire state aid amount under section 423A.02, subdivision 3, allocated one-half in
proportion to the population as shown in the last official statewide federal census for each fire
town and one-half in proportion to the estimated market value of each fire town, including (1)
the estimated market value of tax-exempt property and (2) the estimated market value of natural
resources lands receiving in lieu payments under sections 477A.11 to 477A.14, but excluding
the estimated market value of minerals. In the case of incorporated or municipal fire departments
furnishing fire protection to other cities, towns, or townships as evidenced by valid fire service
contracts filed with the commissioner, the distribution must be adjusted proportionately to take
into consideration the crossover fire protection service. Necessary adjustments must be made
to subsequent apportionments. In the case of municipalities or independent fire departments
qualifying for the aid, the commissioner shall calculate the state aid for the municipality or relief
association on the basis of the population and the estimated market value of the area furnished
fire protection service by the fire department as evidenced by duly executed and valid fire service

area served by each fire department may be considered in calculating the state aid and the fire
departments furnishing service shall enter into an agreement apportioning among themselves the
percent of the population and the estimated market value of each service area. The agreement must
be in writing and must be filed with the commissioner.

association is established after calendar year 1993 and before calendar year 2000, the number of
active volunteer firefighters who are members of the relief association as reported in the annual
financial reporting for calendar year 1998 to the Office of the State Auditor, but not to exceed 30

after calendar year 1999, the number of active volunteer firefighters who are members of the relief
association as reported in the first annual financial reporting submitted to the Office of the State
Auditor, but not to exceed 20 active volunteer firefighters, must be used in this determination. If a
relief association is terminated as a result of providing retirement coverage for volunteer firefighters
by the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter retirement plan under chapter 353G, the
number of active volunteer firefighters of the municipality covered by the statewide plan as certified
by the executive director of the Public Employees Retirement Association to the commissioner and
the state auditor, but not to exceed 30 active firefighters, must be used in this determination.
    (e) Unless the firefighters of the applicable fire department are members of the voluntary
statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter retirement plan, the fire state aid must be paid to
the treasurer of the municipality where the fire department is located and the treasurer of the
municipality shall, within 30 days of receipt of the fire state aid, transmit the aid to the relief
association if the relief association has filed a financial report with the treasurer of the municipality
and has met all other statutory provisions pertaining to the aid apportionment. If the firefighters
of the applicable fire department are members of the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer
firefighter retirement plan, the fire state aid must be paid to the executive director of the Public
Employees Retirement Association and deposited in the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer
firefighter retirement fund.
    (f) The commissioner may make rules to permit the administration of the provisions of this
section.

apportionments.

established. The tax may not exceed 0.02418 percent of estimated market value on taxable property
located in rural towns other than urban towns, unless allowed by resolution of the town electors. The
proceeds of the tax shall be paid into a fund reserved for these purposes. Any proceeds remaining in
the reserve fund at the time the tax is terminated or the district is dissolved shall be transferred and
irrevocably pledged to the debt service fund of the local unit to be used solely to reduce tax levies
for bonded indebtedness of taxable property in the district.

7 and the payment required under subdivision 6, the county shall irrevocably pledge and appropriate

the reserve for payment of the bonds is sufficient to retire the bonds, the county shall levy on all
taxable property in the territory of the organization or unit, without respect to any statutory or other
limitation on taxes, an amount of taxes sufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds and to
restore any deficiencies in reserves required to be maintained for payment of the bonds.
     (b) The tax levied on rural towns other than urban towns may not exceed 0.02418 percent of

   (c) If at any time the amounts available from the levy on property in the territory of the
organization are insufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds when due, the county shall
make payment from any available funds in the county treasury.
    (d) The amount of any taxes which are required to be levied outside of the territory of the
watershed management organization or unit or taken from the general funds of the county to pay
principal or interest on the bonds shall be reimbursed to the county from taxes levied within the
territory of the watershed management organization or unit.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103B.635, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Municipal funding of district. (a) The governing body or board of supervisors of

    (d) For purposes of a provision of a home rule charter or of any special law that is not codified
in the statutes and that imposes a levy limitation based on market value or any limit on debt, the
issuance of bonds, certificates of indebtedness, or capital notes based on market value, the terms
"market value," "taxable market value," and "market valuation," whether equalized or unequalized,
mean "estimated market value" as defined in paragraph (a).
      Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.11, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Generally. Except as provided in this section or section 273.17, subdivision 1, all
property shall be valued at its market value. The market value as determined pursuant to this section
shall be stated such that any amount under $100 is rounded up to $100 and any amount exceeding
$100 shall be rounded to the nearest $100. In estimating and determining such value, the assessor
shall not adopt a lower or different standard of value because the same is to serve as a basis of
taxation, nor shall the assessor adopt as a criterion of value the price for which such property would
sell at a forced sale, or in the aggregate with all the property in the town or district; but the assessor
shall value each article or description of property by itself, and at such sum or price as the assessor
believes the same to be fairly worth in money. The assessor shall take into account the effect on the
market value of property of environmental factors in the vicinity of the property. In assessing any
tract or lot of real property, the value of the land, exclusive of structures and improvements, shall be
determined, and also the value of all structures and improvements thereon, and the aggregate value
of the property, including all structures and improvements, excluding the value of crops growing
upon cultivated land. In valuing real property upon which there is a mine or quarry, it shall be valued
at such price as such property, including the mine or quarry, would sell for at a fair, voluntary sale,
for cash, if the material being mined or quarried is not subject to taxation under section 298.015 and

of a leasehold estate in such property, or at some lesser value than its market value.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.124, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3a. Manufactured home park cooperative. (a) When a manufactured home park is
owned by a corporation or association organized under chapter 308A or 308B, and each person
who owns a share or shares in the corporation or association is entitled to occupy a lot within the
park, the corporation or association may claim homestead treatment for the park. Each lot must be
designated by legal description or number, and each lot is limited to not more than one-half acre of
land.
    (b) The manufactured home park shall be entitled to homestead treatment if all of the following
criteria are met:
    (1) the occupant or the cooperative corporation or association is paying the ad valorem property
taxes and any special assessments levied against the land and structure either directly, or indirectly
through dues to the corporation or association; and
   (2) the corporation or association organized under chapter 308A or 308B is wholly owned by
persons having a right to occupy a lot owned by the corporation or association.
    (c) A charitable corporation, organized under the laws of Minnesota with no outstanding stock,
and granted a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, qualifies for
homestead treatment with respect to a manufactured home park if its members hold residential
participation warrants entitling them to occupy a lot in the manufactured home park.

   Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.124, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
   Subd. 13. Homestead application. (a) A person who meets the homestead requirements
under subdivision 1 must file a homestead application with the county assessor to initially obtain
homestead classification.
    (b) The format and contents of a uniform homestead application shall be prescribed by the
commissioner of revenue. The application must clearly inform the taxpayer that this application
must be signed by all owners who occupy the property or by the qualifying relative and returned to
the county assessor in order for the property to receive homestead treatment.
    (c) Every property owner applying for homestead classification must furnish to the county
assessor the Social Security number of each occupant who is listed as an owner of the property
6950                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [115TH DAY

on the deed of record, the name and address of each owner who does not occupy the property,
and the name and Social Security number of each owner's spouse who occupies the property.
The application must be signed by each owner who occupies the property and by each owner's
spouse who occupies the property, or, in the case of property that qualifies as a homestead under
subdivision 1, paragraph (c), by the qualifying relative.
    If a property owner occupies a homestead, the property owner's spouse may not claim another
property as a homestead unless the property owner and the property owner's spouse file with the
assessor an affidavit or other proof required by the assessor stating that the property qualifies as a
homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (e).
    Owners or spouses occupying residences owned by their spouses and previously occupied with
the other spouse, either of whom fail to include the other spouse's name and Social Security number
on the homestead application or provide the affidavits or other proof requested, will be deemed
to have elected to receive only partial homestead treatment of their residence. The remainder of
the residence will be classified as nonhomestead residential. When an owner or spouse's name and
Social Security number appear on homestead applications for two separate residences and only one
application is signed, the owner or spouse will be deemed to have elected to homestead the residence
for which the application was signed.
     The Social Security numbers, state or federal tax returns or tax return information, including the
federal income tax schedule F required by this section, or affidavits or other proofs of the property
owners and spouses submitted under this or another section to support a claim for a property tax
homestead classification are private data on individuals as defined by section 13.02, subdivision 12,
but, notwithstanding that section, the private data may be disclosed to the commissioner of revenue,
or, for purposes of proceeding under the Revenue Recapture Act to recover personal property taxes
owing, to the county treasurer.
    (d) If residential real estate is occupied and used for purposes of a homestead by a relative
of the owner and qualifies for a homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (c), in order for the
property to receive homestead status, a homestead application must be filed with the assessor. The
Social Security number of each relative and spouse of a relative occupying the property shall be
required on the homestead application filed under this subdivision. If a different relative of the
owner subsequently occupies the property, the owner of the property must notify the assessor within
30 days of the change in occupancy. The Social Security number of a relative or relative's spouse
occupying the property is private data on individuals as defined by section 13.02, subdivision 12,
but may be disclosed to the commissioner of revenue, or, for the purposes of proceeding under the
Revenue Recapture Act to recover personal property taxes owing, to the county treasurer.
    (e) The homestead application shall also notify the property owners that the application filed
under this section will not be mailed annually and that if the property is granted homestead status
for any assessment year, that same property shall remain classified as homestead until the property
is sold or transferred to another person, or the owners, the spouse of the owner, or the relatives no
longer use the property as their homestead. Upon the sale or transfer of the homestead property, a
certificate of value must be timely filed with the county auditor as provided under section 272.115.
Failure to notify the assessor within 30 days that the property has been sold, transferred, or that the
owner, the spouse of the owner, or the relative is no longer occupying the property as a homestead,
shall result in the penalty provided under this subdivision and the property will lose its current
homestead status.

    (f) If the homestead application is not returned within 30 days, the county will send a second
application to the present owners of record. The notice of proposed property taxes prepared under
section 275.065, subdivision 3, shall reflect the property's classification. If a homestead application
has not been filed with the county by December 15, the assessor shall classify the property as
nonhomestead for the current assessment year for taxes payable in the following year, provided
that the owner may be entitled to receive the homestead classification by proper application under
section 375.192.
    (g) At the request of the commissioner, each county must give the commissioner a list that
includes the name and Social Security number of each occupant of homestead property who is the
property owner, property owner's spouse, qualifying relative of a property owner, or a spouse of a
qualifying relative. The commissioner shall use the information provided on the lists as appropriate
under the law, including for the detection of improper claims by owners, or relatives of owners,
under chapter 290A.
     (h) If the commissioner finds that a property owner may be claiming a fraudulent homestead,
the commissioner shall notify the appropriate counties. Within 90 days of the notification, the
county assessor shall investigate to determine if the homestead classification was properly claimed.
If the property owner does not qualify, the county assessor shall notify the county auditor who will
determine the amount of homestead benefits that had been improperly allowed. For the purpose
of this section, "homestead benefits" means the tax reduction resulting from the classification as a
homestead and the homestead market value exclusion under section 273.13, the taconite homestead
credit under section 273.135, the ­ r­

under section 273.1384, and the supplemental homestead credit under section 273.1391.
    The county auditor shall send a notice to the person who owned the affected property at the time
the homestead application related to the improper homestead was filed, demanding reimbursement
of the homestead benefits plus a penalty equal to 100 percent of the homestead benefits. The person
notified may appeal the county's determination by serving copies of a petition for review with county
officials as provided in section 278.01 and filing proof of service as provided in section 278.01 with
the Minnesota Tax Court within 60 days of the date of the notice from the county. Procedurally,
the appeal is governed by the provisions in chapter 271 which apply to the appeal of a property
tax assessment or levy, but without requiring any prepayment of the amount in controversy. If the
amount of homestead benefits and penalty is not paid within 60 days, and if no appeal has been
filed, the county auditor shall certify the amount of taxes and penalty to the county treasurer. The
county treasurer will add interest to the unpaid homestead benefits and penalty amounts at the rate
provided in section 279.03 for real property taxes becoming delinquent in the calendar year during
which the amount remains unpaid. Interest may be assessed for the period beginning 60 days after
demand for payment was made.
    If the person notified is the current owner of the property, the treasurer may add the total amount
of homestead benefits, penalty, interest, and costs to the ad valorem taxes otherwise payable on the
property by including the amounts on the property tax statements under section 276.04, subdivision
3. The amounts added under this paragraph to the ad valorem taxes shall include interest accrued
through December 31 of the year preceding the taxes payable year for which the amounts are first
added. These amounts, when added to the property tax statement, become subject to all the laws for
the enforcement of real or personal property taxes for that year, and for any subsequent year.
   If the person notified is not the current owner of the property, the treasurer may collect the
6952                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [115TH DAY

amounts due under the Revenue Recapture Act in chapter 270A, or use any of the powers granted
in sections 277.20 and 277.21 without exclusion, to enforce payment of the homestead benefits,
penalty, interest, and costs, as if those amounts were delinquent tax obligations of the person who
owned the property at the time the application related to the improperly allowed homestead was
filed. The treasurer may relieve a prior owner of personal liability for the homestead benefits, penalty,
interest, and costs, and instead extend those amounts on the tax lists against the property as provided
in this paragraph to the extent that the current owner agrees in writing. On all demands, billings,
property tax statements, and related correspondence, the county must list and state separately the
amounts of homestead benefits, penalty, interest and costs being demanded, billed or assessed.
    (i) Any amount of homestead benefits recovered by the county from the property owner shall be
distributed to the county, city or town, and school district where the property is located in the same
proportion that each taxing district's levy was to the total of the three taxing districts' levy for the
current year. Any amount recovered attributable to taconite homestead credit shall be transmitted
to the St. Louis County auditor to be deposited in the taconite property tax relief account. Any
amount recovered that is attributable to supplemental homestead credit is to be transmitted to the
commissioner of revenue for deposit in the general fund of the state treasury. The total amount of
penalty collected must be deposited in the county general fund.
    (j) If a property owner has applied for more than one homestead and the county assessors cannot
determine which property should be classified as homestead, the county assessors will refer the
information to the commissioner. The commissioner shall make the determination and notify the
counties within 60 days.
     (k) In addition to lists of homestead properties, the commissioner may ask the counties to furnish
lists of all properties and the record owners. The Social Security numbers and federal identification
numbers that are maintained by a county or city assessor for property tax administration purposes,
and that may appear on the lists retain their classification as private or nonpublic data; but may be
viewed, accessed, and used by the county auditor or treasurer of the same county for the limited
purpose of assisting the commissioner in the preparation of microdata samples under section
270C.12.
    (l) On or before April 30 each year beginning in 2007, each county must provide the
commissioner with the following data for each parcel of homestead property by electronic means
as defined in section 289A.02, subdivision 8:
    (i) the property identification number assigned to the parcel for purposes of taxes payable in the
current year;
   (ii) the name and Social Security number of each occupant of homestead property who is the
property owner, property owner's spouse, qualifying relative of a property owner, or spouse of a
qualifying relative;
   (iii) the classification of the property under section 273.13 for taxes payable in the current year
and in the prior year;
    (iv) an indication of whether the property was classified as a homestead for taxes payable in the
current year because of occupancy by a relative of the owner or by a spouse of a relative;
   (v) the property taxes payable as defined in section 290A.03, subdivision 13, for the current year

and the prior year;
   (vi) the market value of improvements to the property first assessed for tax purposes for taxes
payable in the current year;
    (vii) the assessor's estimated market value assigned to the property for taxes payable in the
current year and the prior year;
    (viii) the taxable market value assigned to the property for taxes payable in the current year and
the prior year;
    (ix) whether there are delinquent property taxes owing on the homestead;
    (x) the unique taxing district in which the property is located; and
    (xi) such other information as the commissioner decides is necessary.
    The commissioner shall use the information provided on the lists as appropriate under the law,
including for the detection of improper claims by owners, or relatives of owners, under chapter
290A.

    Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.1398, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Disparity reduction aid. The amount of disparity aid certified for each taxing district
within each unique taxing jurisdiction for taxes payable in the prior year shall be multiplied by the
ratio of (1) the jurisdiction's tax capacity using the class rates for taxes payable in the year for which
aid is being computed, to (2) its tax capacity using the class rates for taxes payable in the year prior to
that for which aid is being computed, both based upon taxable market values for taxes payable in the
year prior to that for which aid is being computed. If the commissioner determines that insufficient
information is available to reasonably and timely calculate the numerator in this ratio for the first
taxes payable year that a class rate change or new class rate is effective, the commissioner shall omit
the effects of that class rate change or new class rate when calculating this ratio for aid payable in
that taxes payable year. For aid payable in the year following a year for which such omission was
made, the commissioner shall use in the denominator for the class that was changed or created, the
tax capacity for taxes payable two years prior to that in which the aid is payable, based on taxable
market values for taxes payable in the year prior to that for which aid is being computed.
    Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.1398, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Disparity reduction credit. (a) Beginning with taxes payable in 1989, class 4a, class
3a, and class 3b property qualifies for a disparity reduction credit if: (1) the property is located in a

border city that has an enterprise zone designated pursuant to section 469.168, subdivision 4; (2) the
property is located in a city with a population greater than 2,500 and less than 35,000 according to
the 1980 decennial census; (3) the city is adjacent to a city in another state or immediately adjacent
to a city adjacent to a city in another state; and (4) the adjacent city in the other state has a population
of greater than 5,000 and less than 75,000 according to the 1980 decennial census.
    (b) The credit is an amount sufficient to reduce (i) the taxes levied on class 4a property to 2.3
percent of the property's taxable market value and (ii) the tax on class 3a and class 3b property to
2.3 percent of taxable market value.
    (c) The county auditor shall annually certify the costs of the credits to the Department of
Revenue. The department shall reimburse local governments for the property taxes forgone as the
result of the credits in proportion to their total levies.
    Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 275.011, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Determination of levy limit. The property tax levied for any purpose under a
special law that is not codified in Minnesota Statutes or a city charter provision and that is subject to
a mill rate limitation imposed by the special law or city charter provision, excluding levies subject
to mill rate limitations that use adjusted assessed values determined by the commissioner of revenue
under section 124.2131, must not exceed the following amount for the years specified:
   (a) for taxes payable in 1988, the product of the applicable mill rate limitation imposed by
special law or city charter provision multiplied by the total assessed valuation of all taxable property
subject to the tax as adjusted by the provisions of Minnesota Statutes 1986, sections 272.64; 273.13,
subdivision 7a; and 275.49;
    (b) for taxes payable in 1989, the product of (1) the property tax levy limitation for the taxes
payable year 1988 determined under clause (a) multiplied by (2) an index for market valuation
changes equal to the assessment year 1988 total market valuation of all taxable property subject to
the tax divided by the assessment year 1987 total market valuation of all taxable property subject to
the tax; and
    (c) for taxes payable in 1990 and subsequent years, the product of (1) the property tax levy
limitation for the previous year determined pursuant to this subdivision multiplied by (2) an index
for market valuation changes equal to the total market valuation of all taxable property subject to
the tax for the current assessment year divided by the total market valuation of all taxable property
subject to the tax for the previous assessment year.

   Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 276.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Contents of tax statements. (a) The treasurer shall provide for the printing of the tax
statements. The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the property tax statement
and its contents. The tax statement must not state or imply that property tax credits are paid by the
state of Minnesota. The statement must contain a tabulated statement of the dollar amount due to
each taxing authority and the amount of the state tax from the parcel of real property for which a
particular tax statement is prepared. The dollar amounts attributable to the county, the state tax, the
voter approved school tax, the other local school tax, the township or municipality, and the total
of the metropolitan special taxing districts as defined in section 275.065, subdivision 3, paragraph
(i), must be separately stated. The amounts due all other special taxing districts, if any, may be
aggregated except that any levies made by the regional rail authorities in the county of Anoka,
Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, or Washington under chapter 398A shall be listed on a
separate line directly under the appropriate county's levy. If the county levy under this paragraph
includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581,
the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately stated from the remaining county levy
amount. In the case of Ramsey County, if the county levy under this paragraph includes an amount
for public library service under section 134.07, the amount attributable for that purpose may be
separated from the remaining county levy amount. The amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying
under the senior citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount
of property tax before subtraction of the deferred property tax amount. The amount of the tax on
contamination value imposed under sections 270.91 to 270.98, if any, must also be separately stated.
The dollar amounts, including the dollar amount of any special assessments, may be rounded to the
nearest even whole dollar. For purposes of this section whole odd-numbered dollars may be adjusted
to the next higher even-numbered dollar. The amount of market value excluded under section 273.11,
subdivision 16, if any, must also be listed on the tax statement.
   (b) The property tax statements for manufactured homes and sectional structures taxed as
personal property shall contain the same information that is required on the tax statements for real

      (5) for homestead agricultural properties, the credit under section 273.1384;
    (6) any credits received under sections 273.119; 273.1234 or 273.1235; 273.135; 273.1391;
273.1398, subdivision 4; 469.171; and 473H.10, except that the amount of credit received under
section 273.135 must be separately stated and identified as "taconite tax relief"; and
      (7) the net tax payable in the manner required in paragraph (a).
    (d) If the county uses envelopes for mailing property tax statements and if the county agrees, a
taxing district may include a notice with the property tax statement notifying taxpayers when the
taxing district will begin its budget deliberations for the current year, and encouraging taxpayers
to attend the hearings. If the county allows notices to be included in the envelope containing the
property tax statement, and if more than one taxing district relative to a given property decides to
include a notice with the tax statement, the county treasurer or auditor must coordinate the process
and may combine the information on a single announcement.

    Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 287.08, is amended to read:
    287.08 TAX, HOW PAYABLE; RECEIPTS.
    (a) The tax imposed by sections 287.01 to 287.12 must be paid to the treasurer of any county in
this state in which the real property or some part is located at or before the time of filing the mortgage
for record. The treasurer shall endorse receipt on the mortgage and the receipt is conclusive proof that
the tax has been paid in the amount stated and authorizes any county recorder or registrar of titles to
record the mortgage. Its form, in substance, shall be "registration tax hereon of ..................... dollars
paid." If the mortgage is exempt from taxation the endorsement shall, in substance, be "exempt from
registration tax." In either case the receipt must be signed by the treasurer. In case the treasurer is
unable to determine whether a claim of exemption should be allowed, the tax must be paid as in
the case of a taxable mortgage. For documents submitted electronically, the endorsements and tax
amount shall be affixed electronically and no signature by the treasurer will be required. The actual
payment method must be arranged in advance between the submitter and the receiving county.
     (b) The county treasurer may refund in whole or in part any mortgage registry tax overpayment
if a written application by the taxpayer is submitted to the county treasurer within 3-1/2 years from
the date of the overpayment. If the county has not issued a denial of the application, the taxpayer
may bring an action in Tax Court in the county in which the tax was paid at any time after the
expiration of six months from the time that the application was submitted. A denial of refund may
be appealed within 60 days from the date of the denial by bringing an action in Tax Court in the
county in which the tax was paid. The action is commenced by the serving of a petition for relief
on the county treasurer, and by filing a copy with the court. The county attorney shall defend the
action. The county treasurer shall notify the treasurer of each county that has or would receive a
portion of the tax as paid.
    (c) If the county treasurer determines a refund should be paid, or if a refund is ordered by the
court, the county treasurer of each county that actually received a portion of the tax shall immediately
pay a proportionate share of three percent of the refund using any available county funds. The county
treasurer of each county that received, or would have received, a portion of the tax shall also pay
their county's proportionate share of the remaining 97 percent of the court-ordered refund on or
before the 20th day of the following month using solely the mortgage registry tax funds that would
be paid to the commissioner of revenue on that date under section 287.12. If the funds on hand
under this procedure are insufficient to fully fund 97 percent of the court-ordered refund, the county
treasurer of the county in which the action was brought shall file a claim with the commissioner of
revenue under section 16A.48 for the remaining portion of 97 percent of the refund, and shall pay
over the remaining portion upon receipt of a warrant from the state issued pursuant to the claim.

     (d) When any mortgage covers real property located in more than one county in this state the total
tax must be paid to the treasurer of the county where the mortgage is first presented for recording,
and the payment must be receipted as provided in paragraph (a). If the principal debt or obligation
secured by such a multiple county mortgage exceeds $10,000,000, the nonstate portion of the tax
must be divided and paid over by the county treasurer receiving it, on or before the 20th day of each
month after receipt, to the county or counties entitled in the ratio that the estimated market value
of the real property covered by the mortgage in each county bears to the estimated market value of
all the real property in this state described in the mortgage. In making the division and payment the
county treasurer shall send a statement giving the description of the real property described in the
mortgage and the estimated market value of the part located in each county. For this purpose, the
treasurer of any county may require the treasurer of any other county to certify to the former the
estimated market v ­­a­u

    (e) The mortgagor must pay the tax imposed by sections 287.01 to 287.12. The mortgagee may
undertake to collect and remit the tax on behalf of the mortgagor. If the mortgagee collects money
from the mortgagor to remit the tax on behalf of the mortgagor, the mortgagee has a fiduciary duty
to remit the tax on behalf of the mortgagor as to the amount of the tax collected for that purpose and
the mortgagor is relieved of any further obligation to pay the tax as to the amount collected by the
mortgagee for this purpose.
   Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 287.23, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Real property outside county. If any taxable deed or instrument describes any
real property located in more than one county in this state, the total tax must be paid to the treasurer
of the county where the document is first presented for recording, and the payment must be receipted
as provided in section 287.08. If the net consideration exceeds $700,000, the nonstate portion of
the tax must be divided and paid over by the county treasurer receiving it, on or before the 20th
day of each month after receipt, to the county or counties entitled in the ratio which the estimated
market value of the real property covered by the document in each county bears to the estimated
market value of all the real property in this state described in the document. In making the division
and payment the county treasurer shall send a statement to the other involved counties giving the
description of the real property described in the document and the estimated market value of the part
located in each county. The treasurer of any county may require the treasurer of any other county
to certify to the former the estimated market v ­­a­u

in the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter retirement plan has insufficient assets to
meet the service pensions determined payable from the account, the executive director shall certify
the amount of the potential service pension shortfall to the municipality or municipalities and the
municipality or municipalities shall make an additional employer contribution to the account within
ten days of the certification. If more than one municipality is associated with the account, unless
the municipalities agree to a different allocation, the municipalities shall allocate the additional
employer contribution one-half in proportion to the population of each municipality and one-half in
proportion to the estimated market value of the property of each municipality.

estimated market value of the town, they shall not be issued for at least ten days after publication
in a newspaper of general circulation in the town of the board's resolution determining to issue
them. If within that time, a petition asking for an election on the proposition signed by voters equal

auditor, the county board by resolution may declare the town, naming it, dissolved and no longer
entitled to exercise any of the powers or functions of a town.

of the registered voters of the town, filed with the clerk at least 60 days before a regular or special
town election, give notice at the same time and in the same manner of the election that the question
of dissolution of the town will be submitted for determination at the election. At the election the

   Sec. 74. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.033, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Operation area as taxing district, special tax. All of the territory included within the
area of operation of any authority shall constitute a taxing district for the purpose of levying and
collecting special benefit taxes as provided in this subdivision. All of the taxable property, both real
and personal, within that taxing district shall be deemed to be benefited by projects to the extent of
the special taxes levied under this subdivision. Subject to the consent by resolution of the governing
body of the city in and for which it was created, an authority may levy a tax upon all taxable property
within that taxing district. The tax shall be extended, spread, and included with and as a part of the
general taxes for state, county, and municipal purposes by the county auditor, to be collected and
enforced therewith, together with the penalty, interest, and costs. As the tax, including any penalties,
interest, and costs, is collected by the county treasurer it shall be accumulated and kept in a separate
fund to be known as the "housing and redevelopment project fund." The money in the fund shall
be turned over to the authority at the same time and in the same manner that the tax collections for
the city are turned over to the city, and shall be expended only for the purposes of sections 469.001
to 469.047. It shall be paid out upon vouchers signed by the chair of the authority or an authorized
representative. The amount of the levy shall be an amount approved by the governing body of the

year formulate and file a budget in accordance with the budget procedure of the city in the same
manner as required of executive departments of the city or, if no budgets are required to be filed, by
August 1. The amount of the tax levy for the following year shall be based on that budget.
   Sec. 75. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.034, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. General obligation revenue bonds. (a) An authority may pledge the general obligation
of the general jurisdiction governmental unit as additional security for bonds payable from income
or revenues of the project or the authority. The authority must find that the pledged revenues will
equal or exceed 110 percent of the principal and interest due on the bonds for each year. The proceeds
of the bonds must be used for a qualified housing development project or projects. The obligations
must be issued and sold in the manner and following the procedures provided by chapter 475, except
the obligations are not subject to approval by the electors, and the maturities may extend to not more
than 35 years for obligations sold to finance housing for the elderly and 40 years for other obligations
issued under this subdivision. The authority is the municipality for purposes of chapter 475.
    (b) The principal amount of the issue must be approved by the governing body of the general
jurisdiction governmental unit whose general obligation is pledged. Public hearings must be held on
issuance of the obligations by both the authority and the general jurisdiction governmental unit. The
hearings must be held at least 15 days, but not more than 120 days, before the sale of the obligations.
    (c) The maximum amount of general obligation bonds that may be issued and outstanding under
this section equals the greater of (1) one-half of one percent of the ­a

the general jurisdiction governmental unit whose general obligation is pledged, or (2) $3,000,000. In
the case of county or multicounty general obligation bonds, the outstanding general obligation bonds
of all cities in the county or counties issued under this subdivision must be added in calculating the
limit under clause (1).
    (d) "General jurisdiction governmental unit" means the city in which the housing development
project is located. In the case of a county or multicounty authority, the county or counties may act
as the general jurisdiction governmental unit. In the case of a multicounty authority, the pledge of
the general obligation is a pledge of a tax on the taxable property in each of the counties.
    (e) "Qualified housing development project" means a housing development project providing
housing either for the elderly or for individuals and families with incomes not greater than 80
percent of the median family income as estimated by the United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development for the standard metropolitan statistical area or the nonmetropolitan county in
which the project is located. The project must be owned for the term of the bonds either by the
authority or by a limited partnership or other entity in which the authority or another entity under
the sole control of the authority is the sole general partner and the partnership or other entity must
receive (1) an allocation from the Department of Management and Budget or an entitlement issuer
of tax-exempt bonding authority for the project and a preliminary determination by the Minnesota
Housing Finance Agency or the applicable suballocator of tax credits that the project will qualify
for four percent low-income housing tax credits or (2) a reservation of nine percent low-income
housing tax credits from the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency or a suballocator of tax credits for
the project. A qualified housing development project may admit nonelderly individuals and families
with higher incomes if:
   (1) three years have passed since initial occupancy;
    (2) the authority finds the project is experiencing unanticipated vacancies resulting in insufficient
revenues, because of changes in population or other unforeseen circumstances that occurred after
the initial finding of adequate revenues; and
    (3) the authority finds a tax levy or payment from general assets of the general jurisdiction
governmental unit will be necessary to pay debt service on the bonds if higher income individuals
or families are not admitted.
    (f) The authority may issue bonds to refund bonds issued under this subdivision in accordance
with section 475.67. The finding of the adequacy of pledged revenues required by paragraph (a) and
the public hearing required by paragraph (b) shall not apply to the issuance of refunding bonds. This
paragraph applies to refunding bonds issued on and after July 1, 1992.

tax exempt real property within the district becoming taxable equals the net tax capacity of the
real property as most recently assessed pursuant to section 273.18 or, if that assessment was made
more than one year prior to the date of title transfer rendering the property taxable, the net tax
capacity assessed by the assessor at the time of the transfer. If improvements are made to tax exempt
property after the municipality approves the district and before the parcel becomes taxable, the
assessor shall, at the request of the authority, separately assess the estimated market value of the
improvements. If the property becomes taxable, the county auditor shall add to original net tax
capacity, the net tax capacity of the parcel, excluding the separately assessed improvements. If
substantial taxable improvements were made to a parcel after certification of the district and if the

property later becomes tax exempt, in whole or part, as a result of the authority acquiring the property
through foreclosure or exercise of remedies under a lease or other revenue agreement or as a result
of tax forfeiture, the amount to be added to the original net tax capacity of the district as a result
of the property again becoming taxable is the amount of the parcel's value that was included in
original net tax capacity when the parcel was first certified. The amount to be added to the original
net tax capacity of the district as a result of enlargements equals the net tax capacity of the added real
property as most recently certified by the commissioner of revenue as of the date of modification of
the tax increment financing plan pursuant to section 469.175, subdivision 4.
    (d) If the net tax capacity of a property increases because the property no longer qualifies under
the Minnesota Agricultural Property Tax Law, section 273.111; the Minnesota Open Space Property
Tax Law, section 273.112; or the Metropolitan Agricultural Preserves Act, chapter 473H, or because
platted, unimproved property is improved or market value is increased after approval of the plat
under section 273.11, subdivision 1  ­4­­

                                             ­ or 14b, the increase in net tax capacity must be added to
the original net tax capacity. If the net tax capacity of a property increases because the property no
longer qualifies for the homestead market value exclusion under section 273.13, subdivision 35, the
increase in net tax capacity must be added to the original net tax capacity if the original construction
of the affected home was completed before the date the assessor certified the original net tax capacity
of the district.
    (e) The amount to be subtracted from the original net tax capacity of the district as a result of
previously taxable real property within the district becoming tax exempt or qualifying in whole or
part for an exclusion from taxable market value, or a reduction in the geographic area of the district,
shall be the amount of original net tax capacity initially attributed to the property becoming tax
exempt, being excluded from taxable market value, or being removed from the district. If the net
tax capacity of property located within the tax increment financing district is reduced by reason
of a court-ordered abatement, stipulation agreement, voluntary abatement made by the assessor or
auditor or by order of the commissioner of revenue, the reduction shall be applied to the original
net tax capacity of the district when the property upon which the abatement is made has not been
improved since the date of certification of the district and to the captured net tax capacity of the
district in each year thereafter when the abatement relates to improvements made after the date
of certification. The county auditor may specify reasonable form and content of the request for
certification of the authority and any modification thereof pursuant to section 469.175, subdivision
4.
    (f) If a parcel of property contained a substandard building or improvements described in section
469.174, subdivision 10, paragraph (e), that were demolished or removed and if the authority elects
to treat the parcel as occupied by a substandard building under section 469.174, subdivision 10,
paragraph (b), or by improvements under section 469.174, subdivision 10, paragraph (e), the auditor
shall certify the original net tax capacity of the parcel using the greater of (1) the current net tax
capacity of the parcel, or (2) the estimated market value of the parcel for the year in which the
building or other improvements were demolished or removed, but applying the class rates for the
current year.
    (g) For a redevelopment district qualifying under section 469.174, subdivision 10, paragraph (a),
clause (4), as a qualified disaster area, the auditor shall certify the value of the land as the original
tax capacity for any parcel in the district that contains a building that suffered substantial damage
as a result of the disaster or emergency.

to all districts, regardless of when the request for certification was made, and to computation
of increment beginning with taxes payable in 2013, provided that the adjustments to original
tax capacity required by this section apply only to exclusions that reduced taxable market value
beginning with taxes payable in 2012 or thereafter, regardless of when the law authorizing the
exclusion became effective.

    A city may assess a penalty up to one percent of the estimated market value of real property,
including any building located within the city that the city determines to be hazardous as defined
in section 463.15, subdivision 3. The city shall send a written notice to the address to which the
property tax statement is sent at least 90 days before it may assess the penalty. If the owner of the
property has not paid the penalty or fixed the property within 90 days after receiving notice of the
penalty, the penalty is considered delinquent and is increased by 25 percent each 60 days the penalty
is not paid and the property remains hazardous. For the purposes of this section, a penalty that is
delinquent is considered a delinquent property tax and subject to chapters 279, 280, and 281, in the
same manner as delinquent property taxes.

action of its council or governing body, to levy a tax or make an appropriation for the annual support
and maintenance of such cemetery or burial ground; provided, the amount thus appropriated by each
municipality shall not exceed a total of $10,000 in any one year.

     Sec. 90. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 473.661, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Levy limit. In any budget certified by the commissioners under this section, the
amount included for operation and maintenance shall not exceed an amount which, when extended
against the property taxable therefor under section 473.621, subdivision 5, will require a levy at a
rate of 0.00806 percent of estimated market value. Taxes levied by the corporation shall not affect
the amount or rate of taxes which may be levied by any other local government unit within the
metropolitan area under the provisions of any charter.
     Sec. 91. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 473.667, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Additional taxes. Nothing herein shall prevent the commission from levying a tax
not to exceed 0.00121 percent of estimated market value on taxable property within its taxing
jurisdiction, in addition to any levies found necessary for the debt service fund authorized by section
473.671. Nothing herein shall prevent the levy and appropriation for purposes of the commission
of any other tax on property or on any income, transaction, or privilege, when and if authorized by
law. All collections of any taxes so levied shall be included in the revenues appropriated for the
purposes referred to in this section, unless otherwise provided in the law authorizing the levies; but

exclusive of any taxes levied to pay the share of the city for payments on bonded indebtedness of
the corporation provided for in Laws 1943, chapter 500. The levy of taxes authorized in Laws 1943,

      Sec. 93. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 473.711, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Tax levy. (a) The commission may levy a tax on all taxable property in the district as
defined in section 473.702 to provide funds for the purposes of sections 473.701 to 473.716. The
tax shall not exceed the property tax levy limitation determined in this subdivision. A participating
county may agree to levy an additional tax to be used by the commission for the purposes of sections
473.701 to 473.716 but the sum of the county's and commission's taxes may not exceed the county's
proportionate share of the property tax levy limitation determined under this subdivision based on
the ratio of its total net tax capacity to the total net tax capacity of the entire district as adjusted by
section 270.12, subdivision 3. The auditor of each county in the district shall add the amount of the
levy made by the district to other taxes of the county for collection by the county treasurer with other
taxes. When collected, the county treasurer shall make settlement of the tax with the district in the
same manner as other taxes are distributed to political subdivisions. No county shall levy any tax
for mosquito, disease vectoring tick, and black gnat (Simuliidae) control except under this section.
The levy shall be in addition to other taxes authorized by law.
    (b) The property tax levied by the Metropolitan Mosquito Control Commission shall not exceed
the product of (i) the commission's property tax levy limitation for the previous year determined
under this subdivision multiplied by (ii) an index for market valuation changes equal to the total
estimated market v  ­­

    Sec. 102. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 475.58, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Funding, refunding. Any county, city, town, or school district whose outstanding gross
debt, including all items referred to in section 475.51, subdivision 4, exceed in amount 1.62 percent
of its estimated market value may issue bonds under this subdivision for the purpose of funding or
refunding such indebtedness or any part thereof. A list of the items of indebtedness to be funded or
refunded shall be made by the recording officer and treasurer and filed in the office of the recording
officer. The initial resolution of the governing body shall refer to this subdivision as authority for
the issue, state the amount of bonds to be issued and refer to the list of indebtedness to be funded
or refunded. This resolution shall be published once each week for two successive weeks in a legal
newspaper published in the municipality or if there be no such newspaper, in a legal newspaper
published in the county seat. Such bonds may be issued without the submission of the question
of their issue to the electors unless within ten days after the second publication of the resolution a
petition requesting such election signed by ten or more voters who are taxpayers of the municipality,
shall be filed with the recording officer. In event such petition is filed, no bonds shall be issued
hereunder unless authorized by a majority of the electors voting on the question.
    Sec. 103. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 475.73, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. May purchase these bonds; conditions. Obligations sold under the provisions
of section 475.60 may be purchased by the State Board of Investment if the obligations meet the
requirements of section 11A.24, subdivision 2, upon the approval of the attorney general as to
form and execution of the application therefor, and under rules as the board may specify, and the
state board shall have authority to purchase the same to an amount not exceeding 3.63 percent
of the estimated market value of the taxable property of the municipality, according to the last
preceding assessment. The obligations shall not run for a shorter period than one year, nor for a
longer period than 30 years and shall bear interest at a rate to be fixed by the state board but not less
than two percent per annum. Forthwith upon the delivery to the state of Minnesota of any obligations
issued by virtue thereof, the commissioner of management and budget shall certify to the respective
auditors of the various counties wherein are situated the municipalities issuing the same, the number,
denomination, amount, rate of interest and date of maturity of each obligation.
