The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
Dear Madam President:
    I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 281, Senate File 1656, a bill which would require
legislative approval of state academic standards and graduation requirements.
     Minnesota's existing standards review and revision process is carefully designed and thorough.
It has successfully produced rigorous academic standards in math, science, English, language arts,
social studies, and the arts. Even when issues of a controversial nature emerge in specific subject
areas, the current process has produced standards, which have been widely accepted by stakeholders
and held in high esteem nationally. This bill would delay the academic standards process by inserting
it into the legislative arena.
    This bill would seriously undermine the existing standards review and revision process. Under
current law, the process seeks to maximize the input of people with content knowledge and teaching
expertise, as well as various stakeholders, while providing multiple opportunities for public input
and opinion. It would be very difficult to recruit highly qualified people to serve on the standards
committee if they knew the Legislature would then review, approve, or change the standards they
worked so diligently to create.
    I am also concerned about the additional delays this bill would force upon standards
development and implementation timelines, which could cause losses of federal funding and
additional costs to school districts. Applications for federal funds typically require a state to
commit to a standards and assessment revision timeline. Districts align their curriculum adoption
calendars to the state's standard schedule under Minn. Stat. 120B.023. The timeline is very tight.
Adding an additional review process could considerably lengthen the amount of time it would take
to develop the standards, which in turn would make it difficult for districts to align, purchase, or
create new curriculum to train their teachers and to implement the standards.
    Finally, this bill would disrupt the efficient functioning of state government, by assigning a role
to the Legislative Branch which is the responsibility of the Executive Branch. Academic standards
are numerous and detailed. They can take a year or more to discuss, consider, and review by the
committee of experts, including teachers, academics, and business leaders. The process culminates
in a detailed administrative rulemaking process that provides further opportunities for input by
everyone concerned about the outcome. It would be non-productive at best, and counter-productive
at worst, to overlay a legislative review process on top of this process, which has been carefully

   "Sec. 17. [473J.19] PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION; SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
    Any real or personal property acquired, owned, leased, controlled, used, or occupied by the
authority for any of the purposes of this chapter, is acquired, owned, leased, controlled, used, and
occupied for public, governmental, and municipal purposes. The stadium and stadium infrastructure
are exempt from ad valorem taxation by the state or any political subdivision of the state provided
that the properties are subject to special assessments levied by a political subdivision for a local
improvement in amounts proportionate to and not exceeding the special benefit received by the
properties from the improvement. No possible use of any of the properties in any manner different
from their use under this chapter may be considered in determining the special benefit received by
the properties. Notwithstanding section 272.01, subdivision 2, or 273.19, real or personal property,
which is subject to a lease or use agreement between the authority and another person for uses related
to the purposes of this chapter, including the operation of the stadium and related parking facilities,
is exempt from taxation regardless of the length of the lease or use agreement or the characteristics
of the entity leasing or using the property. This section, insofar as it provides an exemption or special
treatment, does not apply to any real property that is leased for residential, business, or commercial
development or to a restaurant that is open for general business more than 200 days a year, or other
purposes different from those contemplated in this chapter."

  "Section 1. [297A.994] CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS SALES TAX; ALLOCATION OF
REVENUES.
   Subdivision 1. Scope. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 297A.99, subdivision 11, the
provisions of this section govern the remittance of the proceeds of taxes imposed by the city of
Minneapolis under the special law.
   Subd. 2. Definitions. (a) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply.
   (b) "City" means the city of Minneapolis.
   (c) "Special law" means Laws 1986, chapter 396, sections 4 and 5, as amended.
   (d) "Tax" means the sales taxes imposed by the city under the special law.
   (e) The terms defined under section 473J.03 apply for purposes of this section.
    Subd. 3. General allocation of revenues. The commissioner shall remit the revenues from the
taxes, less the deductions listed in this subdivision, to the city at least quarterly. The commissioner
shall make the following deductions in the order listed before distribution to the city:
   (1) refunds of any of these taxes due to taxpayers, if any;
   (2) the costs of collecting and administering the taxes, according to the applicable law and
agreements between the commissioner and the city. For revenues from the general sales tax, the
commissioner must deduct a proportionate share of the cost of collection, as described in section
297A.99, subdivision 11; and
   (3) notwithstanding the provisions of any agreement between the commissioner and the city

providing for collection and remittance of these taxes, the commissioner must deposit to the general
fund the amounts specified in subdivision 4.
   Subd. 4. General fund allocations. The commissioner must retain and deposit to the general
fund the following amounts, as required by subdivision 3, clause (3):
    (1) for state bond debt service support beginning in calendar year 2021, and for each calendar
year thereafter through calendar year 2046, periodic amounts so that not later than December
31, 2046, an aggregate amount equal to a present value of $150,000,000 has been deposited in
the general fund. To determine aggregate present value, the commissioner must consult with the
commissioner of management and budget regarding the present value dates, discount rate or rates,
and schedules of annual amounts. The present value date or dates must be based on the date or dates
bonds are sold under section 16A.965, or the date or dates other state funds, if any, are deposited
into the construction fund. The discount rate or rates must be based on the true interest cost of the
bonds issued under section 16A.965, or an equivalent 30-year bond index, as determined by the
commissioner of management and budget. The schedule of annual amounts must be certified to the
commissioner by the commissioner of management and budget and the finance officer of the city;
    (2) for the capital improvement reserve appropriation to the stadium authority beginning in
calendar year 2021, and for each calendar year thereafter through calendar year 2056, an aggregate
annual amount equal to the amount paid by the state for this purpose in that calendar year under
section 473J.13, subdivision 4;
   (3) for the operating expense appropriation to stadium authority beginning in calendar year
2021, and for each calendar year thereafter through calendar year 2056, an aggregate annual amount
equal to the amount paid by the state for this purpose in that calendar year under section 473J.13,
subdivision 2;
    (4) for recapture of state advances for the city share of capital improvements and operating
expenses for calendar years 2016 through 2020 beginning in calendar year 2021, and for each
calendar year thereafter until all amounts under this clause have been paid, proportionate amounts
periodically until an aggregate amount equal to the present value of all amounts paid by the state
have been deposited in the general fund. To determine the present value of the amounts paid by
the state to the authority and the present value of amounts deposited to the general fund under this
clause, the commissioner shall consult with the commissioner of management and budget regarding
the present value dates, discount rate or rates, and schedule of annual amounts. The present value
dates must be based on the dates state funds are paid to the authority, or the dates the commissioner
of revenue deposits taxes for purposes of this clause to the general fund. The discount rates must
be based on the reasonably equivalent cost of state funds as determined by the commissioner of
management and budget. The schedule of annual amounts must be revised to reflect amounts paid
under section 473J.13, subdivision 2, paragraph (b), and subdivision 4, paragraph (c), and taxes
deposited to the general fund from time to time under this clause, and the schedule and revised
schedules must be certified to the commissioner by the commissioner of management and budget
and the finance officer of the city, and are transferred as accrued from the general fund for repayment
of advances made by the state to the authority; and
   (5) to capture increases in taxes imposed under the special law, for the benefit of the stadium
authority, beginning in calendar year 2013 and for each calendar year thereafter through 2046, there
shall be deposited to the general fund in proportionate periodic payments in the following year, an

at two percent per year since 2011, minus
    (ii) 25 percent of the difference, if any, by which the amount of the net annual taxes for the
preceding year exceeds the sum of the net actual taxes in calendar year 2011 plus $3,000,000, inflated
at two percent per year since 2011.

Statutes, chapter 297A that occur within the city, and may also by ordinance impose an additional

person, whether an independent contractor or other representative, who directly or indirectly
solicits business for the retailer.
    (b) A retailer is presumed to have a solicitor in this state if it enters into an agreement with a

at least $10,000 in the 12-month period ending on the last day of the most recent calendar quarter

whom the retailer has an agreement did not engage in any solicitation in this state on behalf of
the retailer that would satisfy the nexus requirements of the United States Constitution during the
12-month period in question. Nothing in this section shall be construed to narrow the scope of the
terms affiliate, agent, salesperson, canvasser, or other representative for purposes of subdivision
1, paragraph (a).

state, as defined in section 290.01, or a business that owns tangible personal property located in this

by the commissioner. The commissioner shall, as designated in the RFP, evaluate construction
manager/general contractor proposals on the basis of best value as defined in section 16C.05, or
using the qualifications-based selection process set forth in section 16C.095, except that subdivision
1 of section 16C.095 shall not apply. If the commissioner does not receive at least two proposals
from construction managers, the commissioner may:
   (i) solicit new proposals;
   (ii) revise the RFP and thereafter solicit new proposals using the revised RFP;
   (iii) select another allowed procurement method; or
   (iv) reject the proposals; and

   (3) the technical review committee shall evaluate the responses to the request for proposals and
rank the construction manager/general contractor based on the predefined criteria set forth in the
RFP in accordance with paragraph (a), clause (2).
    (c) Unless all proposals are rejected, the commissioner shall conduct contract negotiations for a
preconstruction services contract with the construction manager/general contractor with the highest
ranking. If the construction manager/general contractor with the highest ranking declines or is unable
to reach an agreement, the commissioner may begin contract negotiations with the next highest
ranked construction manager/general contractor.
   (d) Before issuing the RFP, the commissioner may elect to issue a request for qualifications
(RFQ) and short-list the most highly qualified construction managers/general contractors. The RFQ
must include the procedures for submitting statements of qualification, the criteria for evaluation of
qualifications, and the relative weight for each criterion. The statements of qualifications must be
evaluated by the technical review committee.
   Subd. 3. Phase 2 - construction manager/general contractor contract. (a) Before conducting
any construction-related services, the commissioner shall:
   (1) conduct an independent cost estimate for the project or each work package; and
    (2) conduct contract negotiations with the construction manager/general contractor to develop
a construction manager/general contractor contract. This contract must include a minimum
construction manager/general contractor self-performing requirement of 30 percent of the
negotiated cost. Items designated in the construction manager/general contractor contract as
specialty items may be subcontracted and the cost of any specialty item performed under the
subcontract will be deducted from the cost before computing the amount of work required to be
performed by the contractor.
    (b) If the construction manager/general contractor and the commissioner are unable to negotiate
a contract, the commissioner may use other contract procurement processes or may readvertise
the construction manager/general contractor contract. The construction manager/general contractor
may (1) bid or propose on the project if advertised under section 161.32 or 161.3206 or (2) join a
design-build team if advertised under sections 161.3410 to 161.3428.
    (c) The commissioner shall provide to all bidders or design-build teams, all data shared between
the commissioner and the construction manager/general contractor during the contract negotiations
under this subdivision.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and expires
one year following the acceptance of ten construction manager/general contractor contracts.

of 5,000 or more, the last federal census shall be conclusive, except as otherwise provided in this
subdivision.
    (b) The governing body of a city may contract with the United States Bureau of the Census to take
a special census. A certified copy of the results of the census shall be filed with the appropriate state
authorities by the city. The result of the census shall be the population of the city for the purposes of
any law providing that population is a required qualification for distribution of highway aids under
chapter 162. The special census shall remain in effect until the next federal census is completed and
filed. The expense of taking the special census shall be paid by the city.
    (c) If an entire area not heretofore incorporated as a city is incorporated as such during the
interval between federal censuses, its population shall be determined by its incorporation census.
The incorporation census shall be determinative of the population of the city only until the next
federal census.
    (d) The population of a city created by the consolidation of two or more previously incorporated
cities shall be determined by the most recent population estimate of the Metropolitan Council or state
demographer, until the first federal decennial census or special census taken after the consolidation.
    (e) The population of a city that is not receiving a municipal state-aid street fund apportionment
shall be determined, upon request of the city, by the most recent population estimate of the
Metropolitan Council or state demographer. A municipal state-aid street fund apportionment
received by the city must be based on this population estimate until the next federal decennial
census or special census.
    (f) A city that is found in the most recent federal decennial census to have a population of
less than 5,000 is deemed for the purposes of this chapter and the Minnesota Constitution, article
XIV, to have a population of 5,000 or more under the following circumstances: (1) immediately
before the most recent federal decennial census, the city was receiving municipal state-aid street
fund distributions; and (2) the population of the city was found in the most recent federal decennial
census to be less than 5,000. Following the end of the first calendar year that ends in "5" after the
decennial census and until the next decennial census, the population of any city must be determined
under paragraphs (a) to (e).

fund and research account as heretofore provided, and for any allocation made under section
162.125, the remainder of the total sum provided for in subdivision 1 of section 162.12 shall be
identified as the apportionment sum, and shall be apportioned by the commissioner to the cities
having a population of 5,000 or more, in accordance with the following formula:
    (1) An amount equal to 50 percent of such apportionment sum shall be apportioned among the
cities having a population of 5,000 or more so that each such city shall receive of such amount the
percentage that its money needs bears to the total money needs of all such cities.
    (2) An amount equal to 50 percent of such apportionment sum shall be apportioned among the
cities having a population of 5,000 or more so that each such city shall receive of such amount the
percentage that its population bears to the total population of all such cities. For purposes of this

Transportation Officials, is incorporated by reference.
    Subd. 3. Bridge. "Bridge" is defined as a structure, including supports erected over a depression
or an obstruction, such as water, a highway, or a railway, having a track or passageway for carrying
traffic or other moving loads, and having an opening measured horizontally along the center of the
roadway of ten feet or more between undercopings of abutments, between the spring line of arches,
or between the extreme ends of openings for multiple boxes. Bridge also includes multiple pipes
where the clear distance between openings is less than one-half of the smaller contiguous opening.
This definition of a bridge includes only those railroad and pedestrian bridges over a public highway
or street.
    Subd. 4. National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS). "NBIS" means standards established
by the Federal Highway Administration in Code of Federal Regulations, title 23, part 650, subpart
C, incorporated by reference.
    Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 165.03, is amended to read:
    165.03 STRENGTH OF BRIDGE; INSPECTION.

    Subdivision 1. Standards generally. Each bridge, including a privately owned bridge, must
conform to the strength, width, clearance, and safety standards imposed by the commissioner for the
connecting highway or street. This subdivision applies to a bridge that is constructed after August
1, 1989, on any public highway or street. The bridge must have sufficient strength to support with
safety the maximum vehicle weights allowed under sections 169.822 to 169.829 and must have the
minimum width specified in section 165.04, subdivision 3.
    Subd. 1a. Inspection. (a) Each bridge must be inspected annually, unless a longer interval not

is authorized by the commissioner. The commissioner's authorization must be based on factors
including, but not limited to, the age and condition of the bridge, the rate of deterioration of the
bridge, the type of structure, the susceptibility of the bridge to failure, and the characteristics of
traffic on the bridge. The commissioner may require interim inspections at intervals of less than one
year on bridges that are posted, bridges subjected to extreme scour conditions, bridges subject to
significant substructure movement or settlement, and for other reasons as specified or inferred in the
AASHTO manual.
   (b) Additional requirements apply to structures meeting the NBIS definition of a bridge:
    (1) Underwater structural elements must be inspected at regular intervals not to exceed 60
months. The commissioner may require inspections at intervals of less than 60 months on certain
underwater structural elements based on factors including, but not limited to, construction material,
environment, age, scour characteristics, the condition ratings from past inspections, and any known
deficiencies.
    (2) Fracture critical members, or FCMs, must receive a hands-on fracture critical inspection
at intervals not to exceed 24 months. The commissioner may require inspections at intervals of
less than 24 months on certain FCMs based on factors including, but not limited to, age, traffic
characteristics, and any known deficiencies.
    (3) The commissioner may establish criteria to determine the level and frequency of these
inspections. If warranted by special circumstances, the commissioner retains the authority to
determine the inspection type and required inspection frequency for any bridge on the state
inventory.

characteristics, state of maintenance, and known deficiencies. The evaluation of these factors is the

   Subd. 6a. Bridge load rating and posting. (a) The term "posting" means the placement of
regulatory signs at a bridge indicating the safe load carrying capacity of the bridge.
    (b) Each structure required to be inspected under subdivision 2, paragraph (a), must be load
rated to determine its safe load carrying capacity, and this rating must be reported on a structure
inventory sheet form provided by the commissioner of transportation. A structure must be rerated
when it is determined that a significant change has occurred in the condition of the structure or due to
additional dead load placed on the structure since the last load rating. Load ratings must be reviewed
and the structure rerated if necessary when the allowable legal load using the structure is increased.
Changes in the load rating of a bridge must be indicated on the structure inventory sheet form.
    (c) If it is determined that the maximum legal load under state law exceeds the load permitted
on the structure under the operating rating stress level assigned, the bridge must be posted. Posting
signs adopted by the commissioner shall be used for the posting. The owner or highway authority
shall post the bridge in accordance with the posted load assigned by the commissioner.

    Subd. 8. Biennial report on bridge inspection quality assurance. By February 1 of each
odd-numbered year, the commissioner shall submit a report electronically to the members of the
senate and house of representatives committees with jurisdiction over transportation policy and
finance concerning quality assurance for bridge inspections. At a minimum, the report must:
   (1) summarize the bridge inspection quality assurance and quality control procedures used in
Minnesota;
    (2) identify any substantive changes to quality assurance and quality control procedures made
in the previous two years;
    (3) summarize and provide a briefing on findings from bridge inspection quality reviews
performed in the previous two years;

   (2) as a condition to issuing a certificate of title, require the applicant to file a bond in the form
and amount provided in subdivision 1b.
    Subd. 1a. Ownership at issue; requirements for certificate issuance. (a) In the event
application is made in this state for a certificate of title on a vehicle with a model year designated
by the manufacturer of more than five years prior to the year in which application is made, and
the applicant is unable to establish sole ownership of the vehicle because one or more owners,
prior owners, or lienholders cannot be found, the department shall issue a certificate of title to the
applicant if the applicant submits:
    (1) the application;
    (2) a bond in the form and amount provided in subdivision 1b;
   (3) an affidavit that identifies the make, model year, and vehicle identification number of the
vehicle, and includes a statement that:
    (i) the applicant is an owner of the vehicle;
    (ii) the applicant has physical possession of the vehicle; and
    (iii) in attempting to transfer interest in the vehicle or obtain a certificate of title or lien release,
the applicant was unable after using due diligence to (A) determine the names or locations of one
or more owners, prior owners, or lienholders; or (B) successfully contact one or more owners, prior
owners, or lienholders known to the applicant; and
    (4) payment for required taxes and fees.
   (b) Unless the department has been notified of the pendency of an action to recover the bond
under paragraph (a), clause (2), the department shall allow it to expire at the end of three years.
    Subd. 1b. Bond requirements. A bond filed under this section must be in the form prescribed
by the department and executed by the applicant, and either accompanied by the deposit of cash
or executed by a surety company authorized to do business in this state, in an amount equal to
1-1/2 times the value of the vehicle as determined by the department. The bond shall be conditioned
to indemnify any prior owner and secured party and any subsequent purchaser of the vehicle or
person acquiring any security interest therein, or the successor in interest of any said person, against
any expense, loss, or damage, including reasonable attorneys' fees, by reason of the issuance of the
certificate of title to the vehicle or on account of any defect in or undisclosed security interest upon
the right, title and interest of the applicant in and to the vehicle. Any such interested person shall
have a right of action to recover on such bond for any breach of its conditions, but the aggregate
liability of the surety to all such persons shall in no event exceed the amount of the bond. Unless
the department has been notified of the pendency of an action to recover on the bond and if all
questions as to ownership and outstanding security interests have been resolved to the satisfaction
of the department, such bond, and any deposit accompanying it, shall be returned at the end of three
years or prior thereto in the event the vehicle is no longer registered in this state and the currently
valid certificate of title is surrendered.

of public safety shall furnish, upon the demand of any person who has or claims to have made a
report or upon demand of any court, a certificate showing that a specified accident report has or
has not been made to the commissioner solely to prove compliance or failure to comply with the

from providing information to any individuals involved in an accident or their representatives
or from testifying in any trial, civil or criminal, arising out of an accident, as to facts within the
individual's knowledge. It is intended by this subdivision to render privileged the reports required,

subdivision, section 13.82, subdivision 3 or 6, or other statutes, is a misdemeanor.
    (e) The commissioner of public safety shall charge authorized persons as described in paragraph
(a) a $5 fee for a copy of an accident report. Ninety percent of the $5 fee collected under this
paragraph must be deposited in the special revenue fund and credited to the driver services operating
account established in section 299A.705 and ten percent must be deposited in the general fund. The
commissioner may also furnish an electronic copy of the database of accident records, which must
not contain personal or private data on an individual, to private agencies as provided in paragraph
(g), for not less than the cost of preparing the copies on a bulk basis as provided in section 13.03,
subdivision 3.

    (f) The fees specified in paragraph (e) notwithstanding, the commissioner and law enforcement
agencies shall charge commercial users who request access to response or incident data relating to
accidents a fee not to exceed 50 cents per record. "Commercial user" is a user who in one location
requests access to data in more than five accident reports per month, unless the user establishes
that access is not for a commercial purpose. Of the money collected by the commissioner under
this paragraph, 90 percent must be deposited in the special revenue fund and credited to the driver
services operating account established in section 299A.705 and ten percent must be deposited in the
general fund.
    (g) The fees in paragraphs (e) and (f) notwithstanding, the commissioner shall provide an
electronic copy of the accident records database to the public on a case-by-case basis using the
cost-recovery charges provided for under section 13.03, subdivision 3. The database provided
must not contain personal or private data on an individual. However, unless the accident records
database includes the vehicle identification number, the commissioner shall include the vehicle
registration plate number if a private agency certifies and agrees that the agency:
   (1) is in the business of collecting accident and damage information on vehicles;
    (2) will use the vehicle registration plate number only for identifying vehicles that have been
involved in accidents or damaged, to provide this information to persons seeking access to a vehicle's
history and not for identifying individuals or for any other purpose; and
   (3) will be subject to the penalties and remedies under sections 13.08 and 13.09.

   (b) No person may operate a bicycle at any time when there is not sufficient light to render
persons and vehicles on the highway clearly discernible at a distance of 500 feet ahead unless the
bicycle or its operator is equipped with reflective surfaces that shall be visible during the hours of
darkness from 600 feet when viewed in front of lawful lower beams of headlamps on a motor vehicle.
The reflective surfaces shall include reflective materials on each side of each pedal to indicate their
presence from the front or the rear and with a minimum of 20 square inches of reflective material
on each side of the bicycle or its operator. Any bicycle equipped with side reflectors as required by
regulations for new bicycles prescribed by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission
shall be considered to meet the requirements for side reflectorization contained in this subdivision.
   (c) A bicycle may be equipped with a front lamp that emits a white flashing signal, or a rear
lamp that emits a red flashing signal, or both.
    (d) A bicycle may be equipped with tires having studs, spikes, or other protuberances designed
to increase traction.

     Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.223, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
   Subd. 5. Other operation requirements and prohibitions. (a) A person operating a motorized
bicycle on a roadway shall ride as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway
except in one of the following situations:
     (1) when overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction;
116TH DAY]                                       MONDAY, MAY 7, 2012                                                             7031

     (2) when preparing for a left turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway; or
    (3) when reasonably necessary to avoid conditions, including fixed or moving objects, vehicles,
pedestrians, animals, surface hazards, or narrow width lanes, that make it unsafe to continue along
the right-hand curb or edge.
   (b) Persons operating motorized bicycles on a roadway may not ride more than two abreast
and may not impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic. On a laned roadway, a person
operating a motorized bicycle shall ride within a single lane.
    (c) This section does not permit the operation of a motorized bicycle on a bicycle path or bicycle
lane that is reserved for the exclusive use of nonmotorized traffic.

      (a) $15 for each single trip permit.
    (b) $36 for each job permit. A job permit may be issued for like loads carried on a specific route
for a period not to exceed two months. "Like loads" means loads of the same product, weight, and
dimension.
  (c) $60 for an annual permit to be issued for a period not to exceed 12 consecutive months.
Annual permits may be issued for:
    (1) motor vehicles used to alleviate a temporary crisis adversely affecting the safety or well-being

    (e) For vehicles which have axle weights exceeding the weight limitations of sections 169.823
to 169.829, an additional cost added to the fees listed above. However, this paragraph applies to
any vehicle described in section 168.013, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), but only when the vehicle
exceeds its gross weight allowance set forth in that paragraph, and then the additional cost is for
all weight, including the allowance weight, in excess of the permitted maximum axle weight. The
additional cost is equal to the product of the distance traveled times the sum of the overweight axle
group cost factors shown in the following chart:

The amounts added are rounded to the nearest cent for each axle or axle group. The additional cost
does not apply to paragraph (c), clauses (1) and (3).
For a vehicle found to exceed the appropriate maximum permitted weight, a cost-per-mile fee of 22
cents per ton, or fraction of a ton, over the permitted maximum weight is imposed in addition to the
normal permit fee. Miles must be calculated based on the distance already traveled in the state plus
the distance from the point of detection to a transportation loading site or unloading site within the
state or to the point of exit from the state.
   (f) As an alternative to paragraph (e), an annual permit may be issued for overweight, or oversize
and overweight, mobile cranes; construction equipment, machinery, and supplies; implements of
husbandry; and commercial boat hauling. The fees for the permit are as follows:
             Gross Weight (pounds) of Vehicle                           Annual Permit Fee
                         90,000 or less                                        $200

                           100,001 - 110,000                                                    $400
                           110,001 - 120,000                                                    $500
                           120,001 - 130,000                                                    $600
                           130,001 - 140,000                                                    $700
                           140,001 - 145,000                                                    $800

If the gross weight of the vehicle is more than 145,000 pounds the permit fee is determined under
paragraph (e).
    (g) For vehicles which exceed the width limitations set forth in section 169.80 by more than 72
inches, an additional cost equal to $120 added to the amount in paragraph (a) when the permit is
issued while seasonal load restrictions pursuant to section 169.87 are in effect.
    (h) $85 for an annual permit to be issued for a period not to exceed 12 months, for
refuse-compactor vehicles that carry a gross weight of not more than: 22,000 pounds on a single
rear axle; 38,000 pounds on a tandem rear axle; or, subject to section 169.828, subdivision 2,
46,000 pounds on a tridem rear axle. A permit issued for up to 46,000 pounds on a tridem rear axle
must limit the gross vehicle weight to not more than 62,000 pounds.
   (i) $300 for a motor vehicle described in section 169.8261. The fee under this paragraph must
be deposited as follows:

and transportation policy and finance on how water-related permitting for transportation projects
can best be streamlined through creation of a single point of issuance system. The recommendations
shall:
    (1) outline a single point of issuance system in which road authorities applying for state water
permits would interact with a single state agency serving as the sole intermediary on behalf of all
state agencies with an interest in a road authority's water permit application;
   (2) provide a goal for the maximum number of days the state believes are necessary to issue final
water permitting decisions;
  (3) identify how state entities with current oversight authority over water permitting decisions
would allocate resources to accommodate a single point of issuance system; and
    (4) suggest strategies to enhance the coordination of federal and state water permitting
information gathering and decision-making.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

or other qualifying organization or entity, plainly displayed on both sides of the vehicle. This
identification must be in a color giving contrast with that of the part of the vehicle on which it is
placed and must endure throughout the term of the registration. The identification must not be on a
removable plate or placard and must be kept clean and visible at all times; except that a removable
plate or placard may be utilized on vehicles leased or loaned to a political subdivision or to a
nonpublic high school driver education program.

   (b) For purposes of the Minnesota base rate schedule, for vehicles with six or more axles in the
"S" and "T" categories, the base rates are $1,520 and $1,620 respectively.
    (c) For each vehicle with a gross weight in excess of 80,000 pounds an additional tax of $50 is
imposed for each ton or fraction thereof in excess of 80,000 pounds, subject to subdivision 12 or
section 169.86, subdivision 5a, as applicable.
    (d) For purposes of registration identification, for vehicles registered in the "O" category, the
owner must declare at the time of registration whether the vehicle will carry a weight of 55,000
pounds or more and therefore be subject to the federal heavy vehicle use tax. For those owners who
declare a weight less than 55,000 pounds, a distinctive weight sticker must be issued and the owner
is restricted to a gross vehicle weight of less than 55,000 pounds.
    (e) Truck-tractors except those herein defined as farm and commercial zone vehicles shall be
taxed in accord with the foregoing gross weight tax schedule on the basis of the combined gross
weight of the truck-tractor and any semitrailer or semitrailers which the applicant proposes to
combine with the truck-tractor.
   (f) Commercial zone trucks include only trucks, truck-tractors, and semitrailer combinations
which are operated by an interstate carrier registered under section 221.60, or by a carrier receiving
operating authority under chapter 221, and operated solely within a zone exempt from regulation
pursuant to United States Code, title 49, section 13506.
    (g) The license plates issued for commercial zone vehicles shall be plainly marked. A person
operating a commercial zone vehicle outside the zone or area in which its operation is authorized
is guilty of a misdemeanor and, in addition to the misdemeanor penalty, the registrar shall revoke
the registration of the vehicle as a commercial zone vehicle and shall require that the vehicle be
registered at 100 percent of the full annual tax prescribed in the Minnesota base rate schedule, and
no part of this tax may be refunded during the balance of the registration year.
    (h) On commercial zone trucks the tax shall be based on the total gross weight of the vehicle and
during each of the first eight years of vehicle life is 75 percent of the Minnesota base rate schedule.
During the ninth and succeeding years of vehicle life the tax is 50 percent of the Minnesota base
rate schedule.
    (i) On trucks, truck-tractors and semitrailer combinations, except those defined as farm trucks
and farm combinations, and except for those commercial zone vehicles specifically provided for
in this subdivision, the tax for each of the first eight years of vehicle life is 100 percent of the tax
imposed in the Minnesota base rate schedule, and during the ninth and succeeding years of vehicle
life, the tax is 75 percent of the Minnesota base rate prescribed by this subdivision.
    (j) For the purpose of registration, trailers coupled with a truck-tractor, semitrailer combination
are semitrailers.

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective October 1, 2012, and applies to all registrations
that are effective on or after that date and special permits issued on or after that date.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 168.013, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3. Application; cancellation; excessive gross weight forbidden. (a) The applicant for
all licenses based on gross weight shall state the unloaded weight of the motor vehicle, trailer, or
semitrailer and the maximum load the applicant proposes to carry on it, the sum of which constitutes
the gross weight upon which the license tax must be paid. However, the declared gross weight upon
which the tax is paid must not be less than 1-1/4 times the declared unloaded weight of the motor
vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer to be registered, except recreational vehicles taxed under subdivision
1g, school buses taxed under subdivision 18, and tow trucks or towing vehicles defined in section
169.011, subdivision 83. The gross weight of a tow truck or towing vehicle is the actual weight of
the tow truck or towing vehicle fully equipped, but does not include the weight of a wrecked or
disabled vehicle towed or drawn by the tow truck or towing vehicle.
    (b) Except as provided by special permit issued under section 169.86, the gross weight of a
motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer must not exceed the gross weight upon which the license tax
has been paid by more than four percent or 1,000 pounds, whichever is greater; provided that, a
vehicle transporting unfinished forest products on a highway, other than a highway that is part of
the system of interstate and defense highways, unless a federal exemption is granted, in accordance
with paragraph (d)(3):
    (1) shall not exceed its gross vehicle weight upon which the license tax has been paid, or gross
axle weight on any axle, by more than five percent and, notwithstanding other law to the contrary,
is not subject to any fee, fine, or other assessment or penalty for exceeding a gross vehicle or axle
weight by up to five percent; and
    (2) between the dates set by the commissioner in accordance with section 169.826, subdivision
1, is not subject to any provision of paragraph (d) or chapter 169 limiting the gross axle weight of
any individual axle unless the entire vehicle also exceeds its gross vehicle weight plus its weight
allowance allowed in clause (1) and plus any weight allowance permitted under section 169.826, in
which case the vehicle is subject to all applicable penalties for excess weight violations.
    (c) The gross weight of the motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer for which the license tax is
paid must be indicated by a distinctive character on the license plate or plates except as provided in
subdivision 12 or section 169.86, subdivision 5a, as applicable, and the plate or plates must be kept
clean and clearly visible at all times.
    (d) The owner, driver, or user of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer, upon conviction
for transporting a gross weight in excess of the gross weight for which it was registered or for
operating a vehicle with an axle weight exceeding the maximum lawful axle load weight, is guilty
of a misdemeanor and subject to increased registration or reregistration according to the following
schedule:
    (1) Upon conviction for transporting a gross weight in excess of the gross weight for which a
motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer is registered by more than the allowance set forth in paragraph
(b) but less than 25 percent, or for operating or using a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer with an
axle weight exceeding the maximum lawful axle load as provided in sections 169.822 to 169.829
by more than the allowance set forth in paragraph (b) but less than 25 percent, the owner, driver,
116TH DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 7, 2012                                           7057

or user of the motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer used to commit the violation, in addition to any
penalty imposed for the misdemeanor, shall apply to the registrar to increase the authorized gross
weight to be carried on the vehicle to a weight equal to or greater than the gross weight the owner,
driver, or user was convicted of carrying. The increase is computed for the balance of the calendar
year on the basis of 1/12 of the annual tax for each month remaining in the calendar year beginning
with the first day of the month in which the violation occurred. If the additional registration tax
computed upon that weight, plus the tax already paid, amounts to more than the regular tax for the
maximum gross weight permitted for the vehicle under sections 169.822 to 169.829, that additional
amount must nevertheless be paid into the highway fund, but the additional tax thus paid does not
authorize or permit any person to operate the vehicle with a gross weight in excess of the maximum
legal weight as provided by sections 169.822 to 169.829. Unless the owner within 30 days after
a conviction applies to increase the authorized weight and pays the additional tax as provided in
this section, the registrar shall revoke the registration on the vehicle and demand the return of the
registration card and plates issued on that registration.
    (2) Upon conviction of an owner, driver, or user of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer for
transporting a gross weight in excess of the gross weight for which the motor vehicle, trailer, or
semitrailer was registered by 25 percent or more or for operating or using the vehicle or trailer
with an axle weight exceeding the maximum lawful axle load as provided in sections 169.822 to
169.829 by 25 percent or more, and in addition to any penalty imposed for the misdemeanor, the
registrar shall either (i) cancel the reciprocity privileges on the vehicle involved if the vehicle is
being operated under reciprocity or (ii) if the vehicle is not being operated under reciprocity, cancel
the certificate of registration on the vehicle operated and demand the return of the registration
certificate and registration plates. The registrar may not cancel the registration or reciprocity
privileges for any vehicle found in violation of seasonal load restrictions imposed under section
169.87 unless the axle weight exceeds the year-round weight limit for the highway on which the
violation occurred. The registrar may investigate any allegation of gross weight violations and
demand that the operator show cause why all future operating privileges in the state should not be
revoked unless the additional tax assessed is paid.
    (3) Clause (1) does not apply to the first haul of unprocessed or raw farm products or unfinished
forest products, when the registered gross weight is not exceeded by more than ten percent. For
purposes of this clause, "first haul" means (i) the first, continuous transportation of unprocessed
or raw farm products from the place of production or on-farm storage site to any other location
within 5­0­ 100 miles of the place of production or on-farm storage site, or (ii) the continuous or
noncontinuous transportation of unfinished forest products from the place of production to the place
of final processing or manufacture located within 200 miles of the place of production.
    (4) When the registration on a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer is revoked by the registrar
according to this section, the vehicle must not be operated on the highways of the state until it is
registered or reregistered, as the case may be, and new plates issued, and the registration fee is the
annual tax for the total gross weight of the vehicle at the time of violation. The reregistration pursuant
to this subdivision of any vehicle operating under reciprocity agreements pursuant to section 168.181
or 168.187 must be at the full annual registration fee without regard to the percentage of vehicle
miles traveled in this state.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective October 1, 2012, and applies to all registrations
that are effective on or after that date and special permits issued on or after that date.

    Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 168.013, subdivision 12, is amended to read:
    Subd. 12. Additional tax for excessive gross weight. (a) Whenever an owner has registered a
vehicle and paid the tax as provided in subdivisions 1 to 1g, on the basis of a selected gross weight
of the vehicle and thereafter such owner desires to operate such vehicle with a greater gross weight
than that for which the tax has been paid, such owner shall be permitted to reregister such vehicle by
paying the additional tax due thereon for the remainder of the calendar year for which such vehicle
has been reregistered, the additional tax computed pro rata by the month, 1/12 of the annual tax
due for each month of the year remaining in the calendar year, beginning with the first day of the
month in which such owner desires to operate the vehicle with the greater weight. In computing
the additional tax as aforesaid, the owner shall be given credit for the unused portion of the tax
previously paid computed pro rata by the month, 1/12 of the annual tax paid for each month of the
year remaining in the calendar year beginning with the first day of the month in which such owner
desires to operate the vehicle with the greater weight. An owner will be permitted one reduction of
gross weight or change of registration per year, which will result in a refund. This refund will be
prorated monthly beginning with the first day of the month after such owner applies to amend the
registration. The application for amendment shall be accompanied by a fee of $3, and all fees shall
be deposited in the highway user tax distribution fund. Provided, however, the owner of a vehicle
may reregister the vehicle for a weight of more than 81,000 pounds for one or more 30-day periods.
For each 30-day period, the additional tax shall be equal to 1/12 of the difference between the annual
tax for the weight at which the vehicle is registered and reregistered. W                 ­h­­

    Subd. 5. Traffic-control signal. (a) Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals
exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in
combination, only the colors Green, Red, and Yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian
signals carrying a word or legend. The traffic-control signal lights or colored lighted arrows
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
   (1) Green indication:
     (i) Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or
left unless a sign ­

right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time this signal is exhibited. Vehicular traffic turning left
or making a U-turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard.
    (ii) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow,
or other movement as permitted by other indications shown at the same time. S ­u­­
                                                                                 ch

shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic
lawfully using the intersection.
   (iii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in subdivision 6,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed

across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. Every driver of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to such pedestrian, except that the pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the green signal indication is first shown.
   (2) Steady yellow indication:
    (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that
the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic must not enter the intersection, except for the continued movement
allowed by any green arrow indication simultaneously exhibited.
    (ii) Pedestrians facing a circular yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control
signal as provided in subdivision 6, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the
roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.
   (3) Steady red indication:
    (i) Vehicular traffic facing a circular red signal alone must stop at a clearly marked stop line
but, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then
before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown, except
as follows: (A) the driver of a vehicle stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection in obedience
to a red or stop signal, and with the intention of making a right turn may make the right turn, after
stopping, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting such movement, but shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by the signal at that
intersection; or (B) the driver of a vehicle on a one-way street intersecting another one-way street
on which traffic moves to the left shall stop in obedience to a red or stop signal and may then make a
left turn into the one-way street, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting the movement,
but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by
the signal at that intersection.
   (ii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in subdivision 6,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
    (iii) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal, with the intention of making a movement
indicated by the arrow, must stop at a clearly marked stop line but, if none, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and
must remain standing until a permissive signal indication permitting the movement indicated by the
red arrow is displayed, except as follows: when an official sign has been erected permitting a turn
on a red arrow signal, the vehicular traffic facing a red arrow signal indication is permitted to enter
the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street on which
traffic moves to the left, after stopping, but must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other
traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by the signal at that intersection.
    (b) In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this section are applicable except those which can have no application.
Any stop required must be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop
must be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop must be made at the signal.
   (c) When a traffic-control signal indication or indications placed to control a certain movement

signal indication or indications within the intersection controls vehicular traffic for that movement
or lane.
   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.06, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7. Flashing signal. When flashing red or yellow signals are used they shall require
obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
    (a) When a circular red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles
shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side
of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver
has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection, and
the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
    (b) When a red arrow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes drivers of vehicles with
the intention of making a movement indicated by the arrow shall stop at a clearly marked stop line,
but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at
the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the
rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
    (c) When a circular yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of
vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past the signals only with caution. Vehicular
traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and
to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time this signal is
exhibited. Vehicular traffic turning left or making a U-turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way
to other vehicles approaching from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate
hazard.
    (d) When a yellow arrow indication is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of
vehicles with the intention of making a movement indicated by the arrow may proceed through the
intersection or past the signals only with caution.
                                                  ­, but shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time this signal is
exhibited. Vehicular traffic turning left or making a U-turn to the left shall yield the right-of-way
to other vehicles approaching from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate
hazard.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.19, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Signal to turn. A signal of intention to turn right or left shall be given continuously

   (2) when preparing for a left turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway;
    (3) when reasonably necessary to avoid conditions, including fixed or moving objects, vehicles,
pedestrians, animals, surface hazards, or narrow width lanes, that make it unsafe to continue along

     (b) A child passenger restraint system is not required for a child who cannot, in the judgment of
a licensed physician, be safely transported in a child passenger restraint system because of a medical
condition, body size, or physical disability. A motor vehicle operator claiming exemption for a child
under this paragraph must possess a typewritten statement from the physician stating that the child
cannot be safely transported in a child passenger restraint system. The statement must give the name
and birth date of the child, be dated within the previous six months, and be made on the physician's
letterhead or contain the physician's name, address, and telephone number. A person charged with
violating subdivision 5 may not be convicted if the person produces the physician's statement in
court or in the office of the arresting officer.
    (c) A person offering a motor vehicle for rent or lease shall provide a child passenger restraint
device to a customer renting or leasing the motor vehicle who requests the device. A reasonable rent
or fee may be charged for use of the child passenger restraint device.

by February 1 of each odd-numbered year on the commissioner's activities and expenditure of funds
under this section.
    Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.85, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Unloading. (a) Upon weighing a vehicle and load, as provided in this section, an officer
may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing until a portion of the
load is removed that is sufficient to reduce the gross weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted under
either section 168.013, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), or sections 169.823 to 169.829, whichever is
the lesser violation, if any. A suitable place is a location where loading or tampering with the load
is not prohibited by federal, state, or local law, rule, or ordinance.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c), a driver may be required to unload a vehicle only if
the weighing officer determines that (1) on routes subject to the provisions of sections 169.823 to
169.829, the weight on an axle exceeds the lawful gross weight prescribed by sections 169.823 to
169.829, by 2,000 pounds or more, or the weight on a group of two or more consecutive axles in cases
where the distance between the centers of the first and last axles of the group under consideration is

    Subdivision 1. Permit authorities; restrictions. (a) The commissioner, with respect to
highways under the commissioner's jurisdiction, and local authorities, with respect to highways
under their jurisdiction, may, in their discretion, upon application in writing and good cause being
shown therefor, issue a special permit, in writing, authorizing the applicant to move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles of a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified
in this chapter, exceeding the gross weight for which the vehicle is registered under chapter 168,
or otherwise not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, upon any highway under the
jurisdiction of the party granting such permit and for the maintenance of which such party is
responsible.
    (b) Permits relating to over-width, over-length manufactured homes shall not be issued to
persons other than manufactured home dealers or manufacturers for movement of new units owned
by the manufactured home dealer or manufacturer, until the person has presented a statement from
the county auditor and treasurer where the unit is presently located, stating that all personal and real
property taxes have been paid. Upon payment of the most recent single year delinquent personal
property or current year taxes only, the county auditor or treasurer must issue a taxes paid statement
to a manufactured home dealer or a financial institution desiring to relocate a manufactured home
that has been repossessed. This statement must be dated within 30 days of the contemplated move.
The statement from the county auditor and treasurer where the unit is presently located, stating that
all personal and real property taxes have been paid, may be made by telephone. If the statement
is obtained by telephone, the permit shall contain the date and time of the telephone call and the
names of the persons in the auditor's office and treasurer's office who verified that all personal and
real property taxes had been paid.
    (c) The commissioner may not grant a permit authorizing the movement, in a three-vehicle

trailer that exceeds the length limitation in section 169.81, subdivision 2, or (2) may grant a permit
authorizing the transportation of empty trailers that exceed 28-1/2 feet when using a B-train hitching

    (d) The state as to state trunk highways, a statutory or home rule charter city as to streets in
the city, or a town as to roads in the town, may issue permits authorizing the transportation of
combinations of vehicles exceeding the limitations in section 169.81, subdivisions 2a and 3, over
highways, streets, or roads within its boundaries. Combinations of vehicles authorized by this
paragraph may be restricted as to the use of state trunk highways by the commissioner, to the use
of streets by the city road authority, and to the use of roads by the town road authority. Nothing in
this paragraph or section 169.81, subdivisions 2a and 3, alters or changes the authority vested in

The amounts added are rounded to the nearest cent for each axle or axle group. The additional cost
does not apply to paragraph (c), clauses (1) and (3).
For a vehicle found to exceed the appropriate maximum permitted weight, a cost-per-mile fee of 22
cents per ton, or fraction of a ton, over the permitted maximum weight is imposed in addition to the
normal permit fee. Miles must be calculated based on the distance already traveled in the state plus
the distance from the point of detection to a transportation loading site or unloading site within the
state or to the point of exit from the state.

   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.86, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5a. Additional tax for excessive gross weight. When a special permit is issued under this
chapter, the commissioner shall collect in addition to the permit fee an additional tax for excessive
gross weight, if the weight allowed under the permit is greater than the gross weight for which the
vehicle is registered under section 168.013. The tax shall be calculated as the difference between
the registration tax paid under section 168.013, subdivision 1e, and the additional tax that would be
due under section 168.013, subdivision 1e, at the gross weight allowed under the permit, prorated
by the number of days for which the permit is effective. Proceeds of the surcharge must be deposited
in the state treasury and credited to the highway user tax distribution fund.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective with the registration period beginning October
1, 2012, and applies to all registrations that are effective on or after that date and special permits
issued on or after that date.

provide a blank or space wherein an officer who issues a citation for a violation of a speed limit
of 55 or 60 miles per hour must specify whether the speed was greater than ten miles per hour in
excess of the speed limit.
   (b) For a citation issued on or after August 1, 2014, the uniform traffic ticket must provide a
blank or space wherein an officer who issues a citation for a violation of a speed limit of 55 or 60
miles per hour must specify whether the speed was greater than ten miles per hour in excess of a 55
miles per hour speed limit, or more than five miles per hour in excess of a 60 miles per hour speed

against a person, whether known or unknown, for the commission of a crime or other offense for
which the agency has primary investigative responsibility ­s i­ are confidential or protected nonpublic
while the investigation is active. Inactive investigative data ­si­ are public unless the release of the
data would jeopardize another ongoing investigation or would reveal the identity of individuals
protected under subdivision 17. Photographs which are part of inactive investigative files and which
are clearly offensive to common sensibilities are classified as private or nonpublic data, provided that
the existence of the photographs shall be disclosed to any person requesting access to the inactive
investigative file. An investigation becomes inactive upon the occurrence of any of the following
events:
   (a) a decision by the agency or appropriate prosecutorial authority not to pursue the case;
   (b) expiration of the time to bring a charge or file a complaint under the applicable statute of
limitations, or 30 years after the commission of the offense, whichever comes earliest; or
   (c) exhaustion of or expiration of all rights of appeal by a person convicted on the basis of the
investigative data.
    Any investigative data presented as evidence in court shall be public. Data determined to be
inactive under clause (a) may become active if the agency or appropriate prosecutorial authority
decides to renew the investigation.

of investigative data. The court may order that all or part of the data relating to a particular
investigation be released to the public or to the person bringing the action. In making the
determination as to whether investigative data shall be disclosed, the court shall consider whether
the benefit to the person bringing the action or to the public outweighs any harm to the public, to
the agency or to any person identified in the data. The data in dispute shall be examined by the
court in camera.
   Sec. 58. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 13.82, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

medical examiner; name and signature of coroner or medical examiner; type of disposition of body;

   Sec. 60. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 13.83, subdivision 4, is amended to read:

which ­si­ are part of an active investigation mandated by chapter 390, or any other general or
local law relating to coroners or medical examiners ­si­ are confidential data or protected nonpublic
data, until the completion of the coroner's or medical examiner's final summary of findings but

                      SUPPLEMENTAL BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 16A.96, is amended by adding a
subdivision to read:
    Subd. 10. Validation. (a) Appropriation bonds issued under this section may be validated in the
manner provided by this subdivision. If comparable appropriation bonds are judicially determined
to be valid, nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to prevent the sale or delivery of any
appropriation bonds without entry of a judgment of validation by the Minnesota Supreme Court
pursuant to this subdivision with respect to the appropriation bonds authorized under this section.
  (b) Any appropriation bonds issued under this section that are validated shall be validated in the
manner provided by this subdivision.
   (c) The Minnesota Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction to determine the validation of
appropriation bonds and all matters connected with issuance of the bonds.
    (d) The commissioner may determine the commissioner's authority to issue appropriation
bonds and the legality of all proceedings in connection with issuing bonds. For this purpose, a
complaint shall be filed by the commissioner in the Minnesota Supreme Court against the state and
the taxpayers and citizens.
    (e) As a condition precedent to filing of a complaint for the validation of appropriation bonds,
the commissioner shall take action providing for the issuance of appropriation bonds in accordance
with law.
    (f) The complaint shall set out the state's authority to issue appropriation bonds, the action or
proceeding authorizing the issue and its adoption, all other essential proceedings had or taken in
connection with issuing bonds, the amount of the appropriation bonds to be issued and the maximum
interest they are to bear, and all other pertinent matters.
    (g) The Minnesota Supreme Court shall issue an order directed against the state and taxpayers,
citizens, and others having or claiming any right, title, or interest affected by the issuance of
appropriation bonds, or to be affected by the bonds, allowing all persons, in general terms and
without naming them, and the state through its attorney general, to appear before the Minnesota
Supreme Court at a designated time and place and show why the complaint should not be granted
and the proceedings and appropriation bonds validated. A copy of the complaint and order shall
be served on the attorney general at least 20 days before the time fixed for hearing. The attorney
general shall examine the complaint, and, if it appears or there is reason to believe that it is
defective, insufficient, or untrue, or if in the opinion of the attorney general the issuance of the
appropriation bonds in question has not been duly authorized, defense shall be made by the attorney
general as the attorney general deems appropriate.
    (h) Before the date set for hearing, as directed by the Minnesota Supreme Court, either the clerk
of the Minnesota appellate courts or the commissioner shall publish a copy of the order in a legal
newspaper of general circulation in Ramsey County and the state, at least once each week for two
consecutive weeks, commencing with the first publication, which shall not be less than 20 days
before the date set for hearing. By this publication, all taxpayers, citizens, and others having or
claiming any right, title, or interest in the state are made parties defendant to the action and the

Minnesota Supreme Court has jurisdiction of them to the same extent as if named as defendants in
the complaint and personally served with process.
    (i) Any taxpayer, citizen, or person interested may become a party to the action by moving
against or pleading to the complaint at or before the time set for hearing. The Minnesota Supreme
Court shall determine all questions of law and fact and make orders that will enable it to properly
try and determine the action and render a final judgment within 30 days of the hearing with the least
possible delay.
     (j) If the judgment validates appropriation bonds, the judgment is forever conclusive as to all
matters adjudicated and as against all parties affected and all others having or claiming any right,
title, or interest affected by the issuance of appropriation bonds, or to be affected in any way by
issuing the bonds, and the validity of appropriation bonds or of any revenues pledged for the payment
of the bonds, or of the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds, including any remedies
provided for their collection, shall never be called in question in any court by any person or party.
    (k)(1) Appropriation bonds, when validated under this section, shall have stamped or written on
the bonds, by the proper officers of the state issuing them, a statement in substantially the following
form: "This appropriation bond is one of a series of appropriation bonds which were validated by
judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota, rendered on ......., ....... (year)."
    (2) A certified copy of the judgment or decree shall be received as evidence in any court in this
state.
   (l) The costs shall be paid by the state, except that when a taxpayer, citizen, or other person
contests the action or intervenes, the court may tax the whole or any part of the costs against the
person that is equitable.
    (m) A justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court is not disqualified in any validation action because
the justice is a landowner or taxpayer of the state.

forms available to health care providers who provide prenatal care describing the newborn screening
program and the provisions of this section to be used in a discussion with expectant parents and
parents of newborns. The department shall make information and forms about newborn screening
available to the persons with a duty to perform testing under this section and to expectant parents
and parents of newborns using electronic and other means.
      (b) Prior to collecting a sample, persons with a duty to perform testing under subdivision 1 must:
    (1) provide parents or legal guardians of infants with a document that provides the following
information:
      (i) the benefits of newborn screening;
   (ii) that the blood sample will be used to test for heritable and congenital disorders, as determined
under subdivision 2;
      (iii) the data that will be collected as part of the testing;
      (iv) the standard retention periods for blood samples and test results as provided in subdivision
6;
    (v) that blood samples and test results will be used for program operations during the standard
retention period in accordance with subdivision 5;
   (vi) the Department of Health's Web site address where more information and forms may be
obtained; and
   (vii) that parents have a right to elect not to have newborn screening performed and a right to
secure private testing;
    (2) upon request, provide parents or legal guardians of infants with forms necessary to request

made part of the infant's medical record and a copy shall be provided to the Department of Health.
When a parent or legal guardian elects not to have newborn screening performed, the person with
the duty to perform testing under subdivision 1 must follow that election. A written election to
decline testing exempts persons with a duty to perform testing and the Department of Health from
the requirements of this section and section 144.128.

for screening in Minnesota;
   (5) validation of equipment and screening methods; and
   (6) continuity of operations to ensure testing can continue as required by Minnesota law in the
event of an emergency.
   (b) No research, public health studies or development of new newborn screening tests shall be
conducted under this subdivision.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 144.125, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

for blood samples with a negative test result is up to 71 days from the date of receipt of the sample.
The standard retention period for blood samples with a positive test result is up to 24 months from
the date of receipt of the sample. The standard retention period for all test results is up to 24 months
from the last date of reporting. Blood samples with a negative test result will be destroyed within
one week of the 71-day retention period. Blood samples with a positive test result will be destroyed
within one week of the 24-month retention period. All test results will be destroyed within one month
of the 24-month retention period. During the standard retention period, the Department of Health

with subdivision 5.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 144.125, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7. Parental options for extended storage and use. (a) The parent or legal guardian of
an infant otherwise subject to testing under this section may authorize that the infant's blood sample
and test results be retained and used by the Department of Health beyond the standard retention
periods provided in subdivision 6 or the purposes described in subdivision 9.
   (b) The Department of Health must provide a consent form, with an attached Tennessen warning
pursuant to section 13.04, subdivision 2. The consent form must provide the following:
    (1) information as to the personal identification and use of samples and test results for studies,
including studies used to develop new tests;
   (2) information as to the personal identification and use of samples and test results for public
health studies or research not related to newborn screening;
    (3) information that explains that the Department of Health will not store a blood sample or test
result for longer than 18 years from an infant's birth date;
    (4) information that explains that, upon approval by the Department of Health's Institutional
Review Board, blood samples and test results may be shared with external parties for public health
studies or research;
   (5) information that explains that blood samples contain various components, including
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); and
    (6) the benefits and risks associated with the department's storage of a child's blood sample and
test results.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 144.125, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 8. Extended storage and use of samples and test results. When authorized in writing by
a parent or legal guardian under subdivision 7, the Department of Health may store blood samples
and test results for a time period not to exceed 18 years from the infant's birth date, and may use the
blood samples and test results in accordance with subdivision 9.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 144.125, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9. Written informed consent for other use of samples and test results. With the written,
informed consent of a parent or legal guardian, the Department of Health may:
   (1) use blood samples and test results for studies related to newborn screening, including studies
used to develop new tests; and
    (2) use blood samples and test results for public health studies or research not related to newborn
screening, and upon approval by the Department of Health's Institutional Review Board, share
samples and test results with external parties for public health studies or research.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 144.125, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
7126                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [116TH DAY

    Subd. 10. Revoking consent for storage and use. A parent or legal guardian may revoke
approval for extended storage or use of blood samples or test results at any time by providing a
signed and dated form requesting destruction of the blood samples or test results. The Department
of Health shall make necessary forms available on the department's Web site. Blood samples
must be destroyed within one week of receipt of a request or within one week of the standard
retention period for blood samples provided in subdivision 6, whichever is later. Test results must
be destroyed within one month of receipt of a request or within one month of the standard retention

The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
Dear Madam President:
   I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 284, Senate File 1717, a bill modifying the State Building
Code, and amending Minnesota Statutes related to licensing and independent contractors.
    This bill would prevent the State Building Code, the State Fire Code, or political subdivisions
from requiring the installation of fire suppression sprinklers in new or existing single-family
homes. Except for this anti-sprinkler mandate, which I vetoed last year, I could support this bill's
other provisions. They include clarification of statutory language governing certain occupational
licenses and apprenticeships, as well as a pilot program for registering construction providers and
improvements in regulating independent contractors.
   Installation of fire suppression sprinklers is required by the International Residential Building
Code, which is currently being considered for adoption in Minnesota. Objections to its requirements
would be best considered through the regular code adoption process, which is now underway. This
process allows adequate notice, time for fact gathering, and a public hearing. Commissioner of Labor
and Industry Ken Peterson is committed to ensuring that the code adoption process is fair. He has
pledged to consider carefully all sides of the issue before making a final decision.
    As I stated in my veto message last year, I take very seriously the concerns which fire safety
professionals have expressed about the safety of home residents, their properties, and the lives of the
men and women who courageously risk their lives to fight those fires. They are concerned that newly
built homes burn more quickly, and that more firefighters are injured when floors collapse during
fires. They contend that, with sprinkler systems in place, fires could be more readily contained,
resulting in fewer injuries and deaths to homeowners and firefighters.
   For those reasons I have vetoed this bill.
                                                      Sincerely,
                                                      Mark Dayton, Governor
   Senator Senjem moved that S.F. No. 1717 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

building authorized before June 30, 2012, from the requirements of this section if the commissioner
determines that the installation of a solar energy system would require the redesign of program space
