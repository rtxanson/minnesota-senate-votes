of a portion of the state-owned lands located within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.
The state owns 116,559 acres of land within the wilderness area, 86,295 acres of which are school

federally owned lands located outside the wilderness area will preserve the spectacular wild areas
while producing economic benefits for Minnesota's public schools.
   (c) For land exchanges under this section, sections 94.342 to 94.347 apply only to the extent
specified in this section.
   Subd. 2. Classes of land; definitions. The classes of state land that may be involved in an

taxing districts, and under the control of county authorities for classification, appraisal, and sale.
    Subd. 3. Priority. An exchange of state land under this section shall give priority to exchanges

   (b) In an exchange of tax-forfeited land for land owned by the United States, the examination
and value determination shall be done in a manner as agreed to between the county board and the
authorized representative of the United States.

substantially equal value. For the purposes of this subdivision, "substantially equal value" has the

determine that the title is good, with any encumbrances identified. The parties to the exchange may
use title insurance to aid in the determination.

article XI, section 10, all expedited land exchanges under this section require the unanimous
approval of the Land Exchange Board.
    Subd. 7. Conveyance. (a) Conveyance of school trust land, university land, or other land
under the control of the commissioner of natural resources shall be made by deed executed by
the commissioner in the name of the state. Conveyance of tax-forfeited land shall be by a deed

land under the control of the commissioner of natural resources is subject to the same trust, if any,
and otherwise has the same status as the land given in exchange. Land received in exchange for
tax-forfeited land is subject to a trust in favor of the governmental subdivision in which it lies and
all laws relating to tax-forfeited land.
