    Subd. 14a. Permitting efficiency. (a) It is the goal of the state that environmental and resource

systems designed to achieve the goal.
    (b) The commissioner shall prepare semiannual permitting efficiency reports that include

on the department's Web site and submitted to the governor and the chairs and ranking minority
members of the house of representatives and senate committees having jurisdiction over natural
resources policy and finance.

documents to the department.

where deficiencies exist and advise the applicant on how they can be remedied. A resubmittal of

    (b) If a person who discharges a pollutant into the waters of the state is required by statute or
rule to obtain a national pollutant discharge elimination system permit or a state disposal system
permit, the person may construct or install, prior to issuance of the permit, at the person's own risk,
a disposal system or any part thereof, unless the action taken:
    (1) is prohibited by federal law or regulation;
    (2) is by a municipality constructing a wastewater system with a design capacity of 200,000
gallons per day, or less;
   (3) is subject to environmental review under chapter 116D, and prohibited from commencing
construction until that process is completed;
    (4) is subject to a grant or loan agreement under chapter 446A;
    (5) requires a construction storm water permit under rules of the agency; or
    (6) requires a subsurface sewage treatment system permit under rules of the agency.
    The person is prohibited from operating the system or discharging pollutants into the waters
of the state until a written permit for the discharge is granted by the agency and until plans and
specifications for the disposal system have been approved, unless the agency waives the submission
of plans and specifications.
    (c) For disposal systems operated on streams with extreme seasonal flows, the agency must allow
seasonal permit limits based on a fixed or variable effluent limit when the municipality operating
the disposal system requests them and is in compliance with agency water quality standards.

    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116.03, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 2b. Permitting efficiency. (a) It is the goal of the state that environmental and resource
management permits be issued or denied within 150 days of the submission of a substantially
completed permit application. The commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency shall establish
management systems designed to achieve the goal.
    (b) The commissioner shall prepare semiannual permitting efficiency reports that include
statistics on meeting the goal in paragraph (a). The reports are due February 1 and August 1
each year. For permit applications that have not met the goal, the report must state the reasons
for not meeting the goal, steps that will be taken to complete action on the application, and the
expected timeline. In stating the reasons for not meeting the goal, the commissioner shall separately
identify delays caused by the responsiveness of the proposer, lack of staff, scientific or technical
disagreements, or the level of public engagement. The report must specify the number of days from
initial submission of the application to the day of determination that the application is complete.
The report for the final quarter of the fiscal year must aggregate the data for the year and assess
whether program or system changes are necessary to achieve the goal. The report must be posted on
the agency's Web site and submitted to the governor and the chairs and ranking minority members
of the house of representatives and senate committees having jurisdiction over environment policy
and finance.

   (c) The commissioner shall allow electronic submission of environmental review and permit
documents to the agency.
    (d) Within 30 days of application for a permit subject to paragraph (a), the commissioner of
the Pollution Control Agency shall notify the project proposer, in writing, of whether or not the
permit application is complete enough for processing. If the permit is incomplete, the commissioner
must identify where deficiencies exist and advise the applicant on how they can be remedied. A
resubmittal of the application begins a new 30-day review period. If the commissioner fails to
notify the project proposer of completeness within the 30-day period, the application is deemed
to be substantially complete and subject to the 150-day permitting review period in paragraph (a)
from the date it was submitted.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116.07, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Adoption of standards. (a) The Pollution Control Agency shall improve air quality
by promoting, in the most practicable way possible, the use of energy sources and waste disposal
methods which produce or emit the least air contaminants consistent with the agency's overall goal
of reducing all forms of pollution. The agency shall also adopt standards of air quality, including
maximum allowable standards of emission of air contaminants from motor vehicles, recognizing
that due to variable factors, no single standard of purity of air is applicable to all areas of the state.
In adopting standards the Pollution Control Agency shall give due recognition to the fact that the
quantity or characteristics of air contaminants or the duration of their presence in the atmosphere,
which may cause air pollution in one area of the state, may cause less or not cause any air pollution
in another area of the state, and it shall take into consideration in this connection such factors,
including others which it may deem proper, as existing physical conditions, zoning classifications,
topography, prevailing wind directions and velocities, and the fact that a standard of air quality
which may be proper as to an essentially residential area of the state, may not be proper as to a
highly developed industrial area of the state. Such standards of air quality shall be premised upon
scientific knowledge of causes as well as effects based on technically substantiated criteria and
commonly accepted practices. No local government unit shall set standards of air quality which are
more stringent than those set by the Pollution Control Agency.
    (b) The Pollution Control Agency shall promote solid waste disposal control by encouraging
the updating of collection systems, elimination of open dumps, and improvements in incinerator
practices. The agency shall also adopt standards for the control of the collection, transportation,
storage, processing, and disposal of solid waste and sewage sludge for the prevention and abatement
of water, air, and land pollution, recognizing that due to variable factors, no single standard of control
is applicable to all areas of the state. In adopting standards, the Pollution Control Agency shall give
due recognition to the fact that elements of control which may be reasonable and proper in densely
populated areas of the state may be unreasonable and improper in sparsely populated or remote
areas of the state, and it shall take into consideration in this connection such factors, including others
which it may deem proper, as existing physical conditions, topography, soils and geology, climate,
transportation, and land use. Such standards of control shall be premised on technical criteria and
commonly accepted practices.
   (c) The Pollution Control Agency shall also adopt standards describing the maximum levels of
noise in terms of sound pressure level which may occur in the outdoor atmosphere, recognizing that
due to variable factors no single standard of sound pressure is applicable to all areas of the state.
Such standards shall give due consideration to such factors as the intensity of noises, the types of
10TH DAY]                      WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2011                                         145

noises, the frequency with which noises recur, the time period for which noises continue, the times
of day during which noises occur, and such other factors as could affect the extent to which noises
may be injurious to human health or welfare, animal or plant life, or property, or could interfere
unreasonably with the enjoyment of life or property. In adopting standards, the Pollution Control
Agency shall give due recognition to the fact that the quantity or characteristics of noise or the
duration of its presence in the outdoor atmosphere, which may cause noise pollution in one area of
the state, may cause less or not cause any noise pollution in another area of the state, and it shall
take into consideration in this connection such factors, including others which it may deem proper,
as existing physical conditions, zoning classifications, topography, meteorological conditions and
the fact that a standard which may be proper in an essentially residential area of the state, may
not be proper as to a highly developed industrial area of the state. Such noise standards shall be
premised upon scientific knowledge as well as effects based on technically substantiated criteria and
commonly accepted practices. No local governing unit shall set standards describing the maximum
levels of sound pressure which are more stringent than those set by the Pollution Control Agency.
    (d) The Pollution Control Agency shall adopt standards for the identification of hazardous waste
and for the management, identification, labeling, classification, storage, collection, transportation,
processing, and disposal of hazardous waste, recognizing that due to variable factors, a single
standard of hazardous waste control may not be applicable to all areas of the state. In adopting
standards, the Pollution Control Agency shall recognize that elements of control which may be
reasonable and proper in densely populated areas of the state may be unreasonable and improper
in sparsely populated or remote areas of the state. The agency shall consider existing physical
conditions, topography, soils, and geology, climate, transportation and land use. Standards of
hazardous waste control shall be premised on technical knowledge, and commonly accepted
practices. Hazardous waste generator licenses may be issued for a term not to exceed five years.
No local government unit shall set standards of hazardous waste control which are in conflict or
inconsistent with those set by the Pollution Control Agency.
   (e) A person who generates less than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste per month is exempt
from the following agency hazardous waste rules:
    (1) rules relating to transportation, manifesting, storage, and labeling for photographic fixer and
x-ray negative wastes that are hazardous solely because of silver content; and
    (2) any rule requiring the generator to send to the agency or commissioner a copy of each
manifest for the transportation of hazardous waste for off-site treatment, storage, or disposal, except
that counties within the metropolitan area may require generators to provide manifests.
Nothing in this paragraph exempts the generator from the agency's rules relating to on-site
accumulation or outdoor storage. A political subdivision or other local unit of government may not
adopt management requirements that are more restrictive than this paragraph.
     (f) In any rulemaking proceeding under chapter 14 to adopt standards for air quality, solid waste,
or hazardous waste under this chapter, or standards for water quality under chapter 115, that are more
stringent than any similar federal standard adopted under the Clean Air Act, United States Code,
title 42, section 7412(b)(2); the Clean Water Act, United States Code, title 33, sections 1312(a)
and 1313(c)(4); and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, United States Code, title 42,
section 6921(b)(1), the statement of need and reasonableness must include documentation that the
federal standard does not provide adequate protection for public health and the environment and a

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116.0711, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4. Animal unit determinations. When making a determination on a permit or taking
any other regulatory action for a feedlot permit, the commissioner shall use the maximum number
of animal units actually confined at an animal feedlot instead of the feedlot's estimated maximum
capacity for animal unit confinement.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116D.04, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. When prepared. Where there is potential for significant environmental effects
resulting from any major governmental action, the action shall be preceded by a detailed
environmental impact statement prepared by the responsible governmental unit. The environmental
impact statement shall be an analytical rather than an encyclopedic document which describes the
proposed action in detail, analyzes its significant environmental impacts, discusses appropriate
alternatives to the proposed action and their impacts, and explores methods by which adverse
environmental impacts of an action could be mitigated. The environmental impact statement shall
also analyze those economic, employment and sociological effects that cannot be avoided should
the action be implemented. To ensure its use in the decision-making process, the environmental
impact statement shall be prepared as early as practical in the formulation of an action. No
mandatory environmental impact statement may be required for an ethanol plant, as defined in
section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), that produces less than 125,000,000 gallons of
ethanol annually and is located outside of the seven-county metropolitan area.
    (a) The board shall by rule establish categories of actions for which environmental impact
statements and for which environmental assessment worksheets shall be prepared as well as
categories of actions for which no environmental review is required under this section.
    (b) The responsible governmental unit shall promptly publish notice of the completion of
an environmental assessment worksheet in a manner to be determined by the board and shall
provide copies of the environmental assessment worksheet to the board and its member agencies.
Comments on the need for an environmental impact statement may be submitted to the responsible
governmental unit during a 30-day period following publication of the notice that an environmental
assessment worksheet has been completed. The responsible governmental unit's decision on the
need for an environmental impact statement shall be based on the environmental assessment
worksheet and the comments received during the comment period, and shall be made within 15
days after the close of the comment period. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not
more than 15 additional days upon the request of the responsible governmental unit.
    (c) An environmental assessment worksheet shall also be prepared for a proposed action
whenever material evidence accompanying a petition by not less than 25 individuals, submitted
before the proposed project has received final approval by the appropriate governmental units,
demonstrates that, because of the nature or location of a proposed action, there may be potential
for significant environmental effects. Petitions requesting the preparation of an environmental
assessment worksheet shall be submitted to the board. The chair of the board shall determine the
appropriate responsible governmental unit and forward the petition to it. A decision on the need
for an environmental assessment worksheet shall be made by the responsible governmental unit
within 15 days after the petition is received by the responsible governmental unit. The board's chair
may extend the 15-day period by not more than 15 additional days upon request of the responsible
governmental unit.

   (d) Except in an environmentally sensitive location where Minnesota Rules, part 4410.4300,
subpart 29, item B, applies, the proposed action is exempt from environmental review under this
chapter and rules of the board, if:
   (1) the proposed action is:
   (i) an animal feedlot facility with a capacity of less than 1,000 animal units; or
   (ii) an expansion of an existing animal feedlot facility with a total cumulative capacity of less
than 1,000 animal units;
    (2) the application for the animal feedlot facility includes a written commitment by the proposer
to design, construct, and operate the facility in full compliance with Pollution Control Agency
feedlot rules; and
    (3) the county board holds a public meeting for citizen input at least ten business days prior
to the Pollution Control Agency or county issuing a feedlot permit for the animal feedlot facility
unless another public meeting for citizen input has been held with regard to the feedlot facility to be
permitted. The exemption in this paragraph is in addition to other exemptions provided under other
law and rules of the board.
    (e) The board may, prior to final approval of a proposed project, require preparation of an
environmental assessment worksheet by a responsible governmental unit selected by the board for
any action where environmental review under this section has not been specifically provided for by
rule or otherwise initiated.
    (f) An early and open process shall be utilized to limit the scope of the environmental impact
statement to a discussion of those impacts, which, because of the nature or location of the project,
have the potential for significant environmental effects. The same process shall be utilized to
determine the form, content and level of detail of the statement as well as the alternatives which
are appropriate for consideration in the statement. In addition, the permits which will be required
for the proposed action shall be identified during the scoping process. Further, the process shall
identify those permits for which information will be developed concurrently with the environmental
impact statement. The board shall provide in its rules for the expeditious completion of the scoping
process. The determinations reached in the process shall be incorporated into the order requiring
the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (g) The responsible governmental unit shall, to the extent practicable, avoid duplication and
ensure coordination between state and federal environmental review and between environmental
review and environmental permitting. Whenever practical, information needed by a governmental
unit for making final decisions on permits or other actions required for a proposed project shall be
developed in conjunction with the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (h) An environmental impact statement shall be prepared and its adequacy determined within
280 days after notice of its preparation unless the time is extended by consent of the parties or
by the governor for good cause. The responsible governmental unit shall determine the adequacy
of an environmental impact statement, unless within 60 days after notice is published that an
environmental impact statement will be prepared, the board chooses to determine the adequacy of
an environmental impact statement. If an environmental impact statement is found to be inadequate,
the responsible governmental unit shall have 60 days to prepare an adequate environmental impact

statement.
    (i) The proposer of a specific action may prepare a draft environmental impact statement
under this section on that action for submission to and review, modification, and determination of
completeness and adequacy by the responsible governmental unit. A draft environmental impact
statement prepared by the project proposer and submitted to the responsible governmental unit
shall identify or include as an appendix all studies and other sources of information used to
substantiate the analysis contained in the draft environmental impact statement. The responsible
governmental unit shall require additional studies, if needed, and obtain from the project proposer
all additional studies and information necessary for the responsible governmental unit to perform
its responsibility to review, modify, and determine the completeness and adequacy of the
environmental impact statement.

                                    TMDL ALTERNATIVES
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 114D.15, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Total maximum daily load or TMDL. "Total maximum daily load" or "TMDL"
means a scientific study that contains a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that may
be introduced into a surface water and still ensure that applicable water quality standards for that
water are restored and maintained. A TMDL also is the sum of the pollutant load allocations for
all sources of the pollutant, including a wasteload allocation for point sources, a load allocation
for nonpoint sources and natural background, an allocation for future growth of point and nonpoint
sources, and a margin of safety to account for uncertainty about the relationship between pollutant
loads and the quality of the receiving surface water. "Natural background" means characteristics of
the water body resulting from the multiplicity of factors in nature, including climate and ecosystem
dynamics, that affect the physical, chemical, or biological conditions in a water body, but does not
include measurable and distinguishable pollution that is attributable to human activity or influence.
A TMDL must take into account seasonal variations. TMDL includes TMDL alternatives.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 114D.15, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 10a. TMDL alternatives. "TMDL alternatives" means analysis and plans that address
water pollution control requirements expected to result in the attainment of an applicable water
quality standard in a reasonable period of time as described in the United States Environmental
Protection Agency's Integrated Reporting Guidance for sections 303(d), 305(b), and 314 of the
federal Clean Water Act, United States Code, title 33, sections 1313(d), 1315(b), and 1324, and
associated regulations and guidelines. TMDL alternatives shall be utilized when a TMDL is not
needed because other pollution control requirements required by a local, state, or federal authority
are sufficient to implement applicable water quality standards within a reasonable period of time.
These alternatives to TMDL's include Category 4b waters that are not required to be included on the
section 303(d) list. TMDL alternatives may be included in a watershed management plan or local
water management plan that is developed or amended, adopted, and approved according to chapter
103B or 103D.

      Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 114D.15, subdivision 11, is amended to read:
    Subd. 11. TMDL implementation plan. "TMDL implementation plan" means a document
detailing restoration activities needed to meet the approved TMDL's pollutant load allocations for
point and nonpoint sources. Applicable portions of watershed management plans or local water
management plans that are developed or amended, adopted, and approved according to chapter
103B or 103D shall be considered TMDL implementation plans if: (1) that purpose is stated as an
objective when the plan is developed or amended, adopted, and approved; and (2) the Board of
Water and Soil Resources has reviewed and approved the TMDL implementation plan based on
procedures under chapter 103B or 103D.
      Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 114D.20, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Goals for implementation. The following goals must guide the implementation of this
chapter:
    (1) to identify impaired waters in accordance with federal TMDL requirements or TMDL
alternatives within ten years after the effective date of this section and thereafter to ensure
continuing evaluation of surface waters for impairments;
   (2) to submit TMDL's to the United States Environmental Protection Agency for all impaired
waters in a timely manner in accordance with federal TMDL requirements or TMDL alternatives;
      (3) to set a reasonable time for implementing restoration of each identified impaired water;
   (4) to provide assistance and incentives to prevent waters from becoming impaired and to
