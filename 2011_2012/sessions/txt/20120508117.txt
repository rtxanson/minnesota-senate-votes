   Sec. 6. [473J.01] PURPOSE.
7160                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [117TH DAY

    The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the construction, financing, and long-term use of
a stadium and related stadium infrastructure as a venue for professional football and a broad range
of other civic, community, athletic, educational, cultural, and commercial activities. The legislature
finds and declares that the expenditure of public money for this purpose is necessary and serves
a public purpose, and that property acquired by the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority for the
construction of the stadium and related stadium infrastructure is acquired for a public use or public
purpose under chapter 117. The legislature further finds and declares that any provision in a lease
or use agreement with a professional football team that requires the team to play all of its home
games in a publicly funded stadium for the duration of the lease or use agreement, serves a unique
public purpose for which the remedies of specific performance and injunctive relief are essential to
its enforcement. The legislature further finds and declares that government assistance to facilitate
the presence of professional football provides to the state of Minnesota and its citizens highly valued
intangible benefits that are virtually impossible to quantify and, therefore, not recoverable even if
the government receives monetary damages in the event of a team's breach of contract. Minnesota
courts are, therefore, charged with protecting those benefits through the use of specific performance
and injunctive relief as provided in this chapter and in the lease and use agreements.
   Sec. 7. [473J.03] DEFINITIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Application. For the purposes of this chapter, the terms defined in this section

amount received in the year prior to the preceding year; provided that the adjustment factor for any
year must not be less than zero percent nor more than five percent.
   Subd. 3. Authority. "Authority" means the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority established
under section 473J.07.
   Subd. 4. City. "City" means the city of Minneapolis.
    Subd. 5. Net actual taxes. "Net actual taxes" means the amount of revenues collected from the

the fees to the state at the same time and in the same manner as provided for payment of tax under
chapter 289A. Revenue from the fee imposed by this chapter must be remitted to the commissioner
of revenue in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner.
   Subd. 4. Administration. The audit, assessment, interest, appeal, refund, penalty, enforcement,
administrative, and collection provisions of chapters 297A and 270C apply to the fees imposed
under this section.
    Subd. 5. Deposit of revenues. The commissioner of revenue shall deposit the revenues from
the fees under this section in the state treasury and credit them to a special stadium revenue account
dedicated to making debt service payments for bonds issued under article 2.
   Sec. 17. [473J.15] CRITERIA AND CONDITIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Binding and enforceable. In developing the stadium and entering into related
contracts, the authority must follow and enforce the criteria and conditions in this section, provided
that a determination by the authority that those criteria or conditions have been met under any
117TH DAY]                           TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2012                                        7171

agreement or otherwise shall be conclusive.
    Subd. 2. NFL team/private contribution; timing of expenditures. (a) The NFL team/private
contribution, including stadium builder license proceeds, for stadium costs must be made in cash in
the amount of at least $427,000,000.
    (b) Prior to the initial deposit of funds under this section, the team must provide security or
other credit worthiness in the amount of $50,000,000, subject to the satisfaction of the authority.
Prior to the first issuance of bonds under section 16A.965, the first portion of the NFL team/private
contribution in the amount of $50,000,000 must be deposited as costs are incurred to the construction
fund to pay for the initial stadium costs.
    (c) After the first $50,000,000 of stadium costs have been paid from the initial NFL team/private
contribution, state funds shall be deposited as costs are incurred to the construction fund to pay
for the next $50,000,000 of costs of the project. Prior to any state funds being deposited in the
construction fund, the NFL team must provide security or a financing commitment reasonably
satisfactory to the authority for the balance of the required NFL team/private contribution and for
payment of cost overruns if the NFL team assumes responsibility for stadium construction under
section 473J.11. Thereafter, budgeted project costs shall be borne by the authority and the NFL
team/private contributions in amounts proportionate to their remaining funding commitments.
   (d) In the event the project terminates before the initial $100,000,000 in contributions are
expended by the parties under this subdivision, the parties shall be reimbursed in the amounts
they have deposited to the construction fund proportionate to project funding percentages, in the
amounts of 56 percent by the authority and 44 percent by the NFL team/private contributions.
    Subd. 3. Lease or use agreements; 40-year term. The authority must enter into a long-term
lease or use agreement with the NFL team for the NFL team's use of the stadium. The NFL team must
agree to play all preseason, regular season, and postseason home games at the stadium. Training
facilities must remain in Minnesota during the term of the lease or use agreement. The lease or
use agreement must be for a term of at least 40 years from the date of substantial completion of
the stadium for professional football games. The lease or use agreement may provide options for
the NFL team to extend the term for up to four additional periods of five years. The lease or use
agreement must include terms for default, termination, and breach of the agreement. Recognizing
that the presence of professional football provides to the state of Minnesota and its citizens highly
valued, intangible benefits that are virtually impossible to quantify and, therefore, not recoverable
in the event of the NFL team owner's breach of contract, the lease and use agreements must provide
for specific performance and injunctive relief to enforce provisions relating to use of the stadium for
professional football and must not include escape clauses or buyout provisions. The NFL team must
not enter into or accept any agreement or requirement with or from any entity that is inconsistent
with the NFL team's binding commitment to the 40-year term of the lease or use agreement or that
would in any manner dilute, interfere with, or negate the provisions of the lease or use agreement,
providing for specific performance or injunctive relief. The legislature conclusively determines, as a
matter of public policy, that the lease or use agreement, and any grant agreement under this chapter
that includes a specific performance clause:
   (1) explicitly authorizes specific performance as a remedy for breach;
   (2) is made for adequate consideration and upon terms which are otherwise fair and reasonable;
7172                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [117TH DAY

   (3) has not been included through sharp practice, misrepresentation, or mistake;
    (4) if specifically enforced, does not cause unreasonable or disproportionate hardship or loss to
the NFL team or to third parties; and
    (5) involves performance in a manner and the rendering of services of a nature and under
circumstances that the beneficiary cannot be adequately compensated in damages.
    Subd. 4. Lease or use agreements; revenues, payments. A lease or use agreement shall include
rent and other fees and expenses to be paid by the NFL team. The authority shall agree to provide
in the lease or use agreement for the NFL team to receive all NFL and team event related revenues,
including, but not limited to, suite revenues, advertising, concessions, signage, broadcast and media,
and club seat revenue, except as provided by section 473J.14. The agreement shall also provide
that all naming rights to the stadium are retained by the NFL team, subject to the approval of the
name or names by the authority consistent with those criteria set out in the lease or use agreement.
The agreement shall provide for the authority to receive all general ticket revenues and other event
revenues other than from NFL team games, NFL team-owned major league soccer games, and other
NFL team events agreed to by the authority.
    Subd. 5. Plaza naming rights. The state shall retain naming rights to the stadium plaza. The
amount of revenue generated through the naming rights of the stadium plaza must be deposited
into an account in the special revenue fund. On January 15 of each year, the commissioner of
management and budget must certify the amount in the account. The amount certified attributable
to plaza naming rights is appropriated to the commissioner for a grant to the authority for amateur
sports facilities under section 240A.12.
    Subd. 6. Notice of breach or default. Until 40 years from the date of stadium completion, the
NFL team must provide written notice to the authority not less than 180 days prior to any action,
including any action imposed upon the NFL team by the NFL, which would result in a breach or
default of provisions of the lease or use agreements required to be included under subdivision 3. If
this notice provision is violated and the NFL team has already breached or been in default under the
required provisions, the authority or the state of Minnesota may specifically enforce the lease or use
agreement and Minnesota courts shall fashion equitable remedies so that the NFL team fulfills the
conditions of the lease and use agreements.
    Subd. 7. Enforceable financial commitments. The authority must determine before stadium
construction begins that all public and private funding sources for construction, operating expenses,
and capital improvements and repairs of the stadium are included in written agreements. The
committed funds must be adequate to design, construct, furnish, and equip the stadium, and pay
projected operating expenses and the costs of capital improvements and repairs during the term
of the lease or use agreement with the NFL team. The NFL team must provide the authority
access to NFL team financial or other information, which the authority deems necessary for
such determination. Any financial information obtained by the authority under this subdivision is
nonpublic data under section 13.02, subdivision 9.
   Subd. 8. Environmental requirements. The authority must comply with all environmental
requirements imposed by regulatory agencies for the stadium, site, and structure, except as provided
by section 473J.09, subdivision 11, or by section 473J.17.
   Subd. 9. Public share on sale of NFL team. The lease or use agreement must provide that, if
117TH DAY]                            TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2012                                          7173

the NFL team is sold or an interest in the NFL team is sold after the effective date of this chapter,
a portion of the sale price must be used to pay down the remaining debt service. If any portion
remains after debt service is paid, that amount is paid to the authority and deposited in a reserve fund
for improvements to the stadium or expended as the authority may otherwise direct. The portion
required to be so paid to the authority is 25 percent of the amount in excess of the purchase price of
the NFL team by the selling owner or owners for the first ten years after commencement of stadium
construction, declining to 15 percent for the next ten years, and further declining to ten percent for
the next ten years. The agreement must provide exceptions for sales to members of the owners'
family and entities and trusts beneficially owned by family members, sales to employees of equity
interests aggregating up to ten percent, sales related to capital infusions not distributed to the owners,
and sales amongst existing owners not exceeding 20 percent equity interest in the NFL team.
    Subd. 10. Authority's access to NFL team financial information. A notice provision for a
material breach shall be agreed to between the authority and the NFL team. In the event there is a
material breach by the NFL team under the lease or use agreement, the lease or use agreement must
provide the authority access to audited financial statements of the NFL team and other financial
information that the authority deems necessary to enforce the terms of any lease or use agreements.
Any financial information obtained by the authority under this subdivision is nonpublic data under
section 13.02, subdivision 9.
    Subd. 11. NFL team name retained. The lease or use agreement must provide that the NFL
team and NFL will transfer to the state of Minnesota the Minnesota Vikings' heritage and records,
including the name, logo, colors, history, playing records, trophies, and memorabilia in the event of
relocation of the NFL team in violation of the lease or use agreement.
   Subd. 12. Stadium design. (a) The authority and the NFL team will build a stadium that is
environmentally and energy efficient and will make an effort to build a stadium that is eligible
to receive the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification or the
Green Building Initiative Green Globes certification for environmental design, and to the extent
practicable, will strive to make the stadium design architecturally significant.
    (b) The stadium design must, to the extent feasible, follow sustainable building guidelines
established under section 16B.325.
    (c) The authority and the team must ensure that the stadium be constructed with steel made in
the USA.
    Subd. 13. Necessary approvals. The authority and the NFL team must secure any necessary
approvals to the terms of the lease and use agreement and the design and construction plans for the
stadium, including prior approval of the NFL.
   Subd. 14. Affordable access. The lease or use agreement must provide for an agreed-upon
number of affordable tickets to the professional sporting events held in the stadium.
    Subd. 15. Stadium builder's licenses. The authority shall own and retain the exclusive right to
sell stadium builder's licenses in the stadium. The authority will retain the NFL team to act as the
authority's agent in marketing and selling such licenses.
   Subd. 16. Major league soccer. (a) The authority shall, for five years after the first NFL team
home game is played in the stadium, grant the NFL team the exclusive right to establish major league
7174                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [117TH DAY

soccer at the stadium. The authority and the NFL team may enter into an agreement providing the
terms and conditions of such an arrangement, provided:
    (1) if any of the NFL team owners whose family owns at least three percent of the NFL team
purchases full or partial ownership in a major league soccer franchise, such franchise may play in the
stadium under a use agreement with similar terms as are applicable to the NFL team at no additional
rent for five years after the first NFL team home game is played in the stadium, but including a
provision of payment of game-day costs and reasonable marginal costs incurred by the authority as
a result of the major league soccer team; and
  (2) capital improvements required by a major league soccer franchise must be financed by the
owners of the major league soccer team, unless otherwise agreed to by the authority.
    (b) Five years after the first NFL team home game is played in the stadium, the authority and
the NFL team shall enter into an agreement providing for rental payments.
    Subd. 17. NFL team-related entities. Subject to the prior approval of the authority, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, any of the obligations by the NFL team may be performed by the NFL
team, a related entity, or a third party, and the NFL team, any entity related to the NFL team or third
party may receive any revenues to which the NFL team is entitled hereunder; provided, however,
the NFL team shall remain liable if any obligations are assigned to a related entity or third party.
   Sec. 18. [473J.17] MUNICIPAL ACTIVITIES.
    Subdivision 1. Property acquisition and disposition. The city may, to the extent legally
permissible, acquire land, air rights, and other property interests within the development area
for the stadium site and stadium infrastructure and convey it to the authority with or without
consideration, prepare a site for development as a stadium, and acquire and construct any related
stadium infrastructure. To the extent property parcels or interests acquired are more extensive than
the stadium infrastructure requirements, the city may sell or otherwise dispose of the excess.
    Subd. 2. Claims. Except as may be mutually agreed to by the city and the authority, the city has
no interest in or claim to any assets or revenues of the authority.
    Subd. 3. Environmental; planning and zoning. The authority is the responsible governmental
unit for an environmental impact statement for the stadium prepared under section 116D.04, if an
environmental impact statement is necessary. Notwithstanding section 116D.04, subdivision 2b,
and implementing rules: (1) the environmental impact statement shall not be required to consider
alternative stadium sites; and (2) the environmental impact statement must be determined to be
adequate before commencing work on the foundation of the stadium, but the stadium and stadium
infrastructure may otherwise be started and all preliminary and final government decisions and
actions may be made and taken including, but not limited to, acquiring land; obtaining financing;
granting permits or other land use approvals; entering into grant, lease, or use agreements; or
preparing the site or related stadium infrastructure prior to a determination of the adequacy of the
environmental impact statement.
    Subd. 4. Local government expenditure. The city may make expenditures or grants for other
costs incidental and necessary to further the purposes of this chapter and may, by agreement,
reimburse in whole or in part, any entity that has granted, loaned, or advanced funds to the city to
further the purposes of this chapter. The city may reimburse the authority or a local governmental
117TH DAY]                           TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2012                                        7175

entity or make a grant to the authority or such a governmental unit or be reimbursed by the authority
or local governmental entity for site acquisition, preparation of the site for stadium development,
and stadium infrastructure.
    Subd. 5. Municipal authority. The legislature intends that, except as expressly limited herein,
the city may acquire and develop stadium infrastructure, enter into contracts with the authority
and other governmental or nongovernmental entities, appropriate funds, and make employees,
consultants, and other revenues available for those purposes.
     Subd. 6. Stadium Implementation Committee; city review. In order to accomplish the
objectives of this act within the required time frame, it is necessary to establish an alternative
process for municipal land use and development review. It is hereby found and declared that
the construction of a stadium within the development area is consistent with the adopted area
plan, is the preferred stadium location, and is a permitted land use. This subdivision establishes a
procedure for all land use and development reviews and approvals by the city of Minneapolis for
the stadium and related stadium infrastructure and supersedes all land use and development rules
and restrictions and procedures imposed by other law, charter, or ordinance, including without
limitation section 15.99. No later than 30 days after timely compliance of the city as provided in
article 4, section 5, of this act, the city of Minneapolis shall establish a stadium implementation
committee to make recommendations on the design plans submitted for the stadium, and stadium
infrastructure, and related improvements. The implementation committee must take action to issue
its recommendations within the time frames established in the planning and construction timetable
issued by the authority which shall provide for no less than 60 days for the committee's review. The
recommendations of the implementation committee shall be forwarded to the city of Minneapolis
Planning Commission for an advisory recommendation and then to the city council for final action
in a single resolution, which final action must be taken within 45 days of the submission of the
recommendations to the planning commission. The city council shall not impose any unreasonable
conditions on the recommendations of the implementation committee, nor take any action or
impose any conditions that will result in delay from the time frames established in the planning
and construction timetable or in additional overall costs. Failure of the city council to act within
the 45-day period shall be deemed to be approval. The authority may seek de novo review in the
district court of any city council action. The district court or any appellate court shall expedite
review to the maximum extent possible and timely issue relief, orders, or opinions as necessary to
give effect to the provisions and objectives in this act.
   Sec. 19. [473J.19] PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION; SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
    Any real or personal property acquired, owned, leased, controlled, used, or occupied by the
authority for any of the purposes of this chapter, is acquired, owned, leased, controlled, used, and
occupied for public, governmental, and municipal purposes. The stadium and stadium infrastructure
are exempt from ad valorem taxation by the state or any political subdivision of the state provided
that the properties are subject to special assessments levied by a political subdivision for a local
improvement in amounts proportionate to and not exceeding the special benefit received by the
properties from the improvement. No possible use of any of the properties in any manner different
from their use under this chapter may be considered in determining the special benefit received by
the properties. Notwithstanding section 272.01, subdivision 2, or 273.19, real or personal property,
which is subject to a lease or use agreement between the authority and another person for uses related
to the purposes of this chapter, including the operation of the stadium and related parking facilities,
7176                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [117TH DAY

is exempt from taxation regardless of the length of the lease or use agreement or the characteristics
of the entity leasing or using the property. This section, insofar as it provides an exemption or special
treatment, does not apply to any real property that is leased for residential, business, or commercial
development or to a restaurant that is open for general business more than 200 days a year, or other
purposes different from those contemplated in this chapter.
   Sec. 20. [473J.25] METROPOLITAN SPORTS FACILITIES COMMISSION ASSETS;
LIABILITIES TO AUTHORITY.
    Subdivision 1. Authority expenses. The Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission shall pay
the operating expenses of the authority including salaries, compensation, and other personnel, office,
equipment, consultant and any other costs, until the commission is abolished pursuant to subdivision
3.
   Subd. 2. Transfer. Within 90 days of the enactment of this chapter, the Metropolitan Sports
Facilities Commission shall pay its outstanding obligations, settle its accounts, and transfer its
remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations to the authority, for its purposes.
    Subd. 3. Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission abolished; interim powers conferred
on authority. Upon transfer to the authority of all remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations of
the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, in subdivision 2, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities
Commission is abolished. When the remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations of the Metropolitan
Sports Facilities Commission have been transferred to the authority and the commission has been
abolished, the powers and duties of the commission under sections 473.551 to 473.599, and any
other law shall devolve upon the authority, in addition to the powers and duties of the authority
under this chapter, until the first NFL home game is played at the stadium.
    Subd. 4. Employees. Upon transfer of ownership all persons employed by the Metropolitan
Sports Facilities Commission shall be transferred to the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority
without loss of right or privilege. Nothing in this section shall be construed to give any such person
the right or privilege to continue in the same level or classification of employment previously held.
The Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority may assign any such person to an employment level and
classification which it deems appropriate and desirable in accordance with its personnel code.
    Subd. 5. Conforming changes. The Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission shall submit a
technical bill to the 2013 legislature making any cross-reference, grammatical, or other conforming
changes necessary as a result of this act. This bill shall be submitted by February 12, 2013.
   Sec. 21. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Except as otherwise provided, this article is effective the day following final enactment.

during a biennium from one or more of the following sources:

    (c) "Debt service" means the amount payable in any biennium of principal, premium, if any, and
interest on appropriation bonds.
    Subd. 2. Authorization to issue appropriation bonds. (a) Subject to the limitations of this
subdivision, the commissioner may sell and issue appropriation bonds of the state under this section
for public purposes as provided by law, including, in particular, the financing of all or a portion
of the acquisition, construction, improving, and equipping of the stadium project of the Minnesota
Sports Facilities Authority as provided by chapter 473J. Proceeds of the appropriation bonds must
be credited to a special appropriation stadium bond proceeds fund in the state treasury. Net income
from investment of the proceeds, as estimated by the commissioner, must be credited to the special
appropriation stadium bond proceeds fund.
    (b) Appropriation bonds may be sold and issued in amounts that, in the opinion of the
commissioner, are necessary to provide sufficient funds, not to exceed $548,000,000 net of costs of
issuance, deposits for debt service reserve funds, and costs of credit enhancement for achieving the
purposes authorized as provided under paragraph (a), and pay debt service, pay costs of issuance,
make deposits to reserve funds, pay the costs of credit enhancement, or make payments under other
agreements entered into under paragraph (d); provided, however, that appropriation bonds issued
and unpaid shall not exceed $650,000,000 in principal amount, excluding refunding bonds sold
and issued under subdivision 4.
    (c) Appropriation bonds may be issued from time to time in one or more series on the terms and
conditions the commissioner determines to be in the best interests of the state, but the term on any
series of appropriation bonds may not exceed 30 years. The appropriation bonds of each issue and
series thereof shall be dated and bear interest, and may be includable in or excludable from the gross
income of the owners for federal income tax purposes.
    (d) At the time of, or in anticipation of, issuing the appropriation bonds, and at any time
thereafter, so long as the appropriation bonds are outstanding, the commissioner may enter into
agreements and ancillary arrangements relating to the appropriation bonds, including, but not
limited to, trust indentures, grant agreements, lease or use agreements, operating agreements,
management agreements, liquidity facilities, remarketing or dealer agreements, letter of credit
agreements, insurance policies, guaranty agreements, reimbursement agreements, indexing
agreements, or interest exchange agreements. Any payments made or received according to the
agreement or ancillary arrangement shall be made from or deposited as provided in the agreement
or ancillary arrangement. The determination of the commissioner included in an interest exchange
agreement that the agreement relates to an appropriation bond shall be conclusive.
7178                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [117TH DAY

    (e) The commissioner may enter into written agreements or contracts relating to the continuing
disclosure of information necessary to comply with, or facilitate the issuance of appropriation bonds
in accordance with federal securities laws, rules, and regulations, including Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and regulations in Code of Federal Regulations, title 17, section 240.15c 2-12.
An agreement may be in the form of covenants with purchasers and holders of appropriation bonds
set forth in the order or resolution authorizing the issuance of the appropriation bonds, or a separate
document authorized by the order or resolution.
   (f) The appropriation bonds are not subject to chapter 16C.
    Subd. 3. Form; procedure. (a) Appropriation bonds may be issued in the form of bonds, notes,
or other similar instruments, and in the manner provided in section 16A.672. In the event that any
provision of section 16A.672 conflicts with this section, this section shall control.
    (b) Every appropriation bond shall include a conspicuous statement of the limitation established
in subdivision 6.
   (c) Appropriation bonds may be sold at either public or private sale upon such terms as the
commissioner shall determine are not inconsistent with this section and may be sold at any price or
percentage of par value. Any bid received may be rejected.
   (d) Appropriation bonds must bear interest at a fixed or variable rate.
   (e) Notwithstanding any other law, appropriation bonds issued under this section shall be fully
negotiable.
    Subd. 4. Refunding bonds. The commissioner from time to time may issue appropriation bonds
for the purpose of refunding any appropriation bonds then outstanding, including the payment of
any redemption premiums on the bonds, any interest accrued or to accrue to the redemption date,
and costs related to the issuance and sale of the refunding bonds. The proceeds of any refunding
bonds may, in the discretion of the commissioner, be applied to the purchase or payment at maturity
of the appropriation bonds to be refunded, to the redemption of the outstanding appropriation bonds
on any redemption date, or to pay interest on the refunding bonds and may, pending application, be
placed in escrow to be applied to the purchase, payment, retirement, or redemption. Any escrowed
proceeds, pending such use, may be invested and reinvested in obligations that are authorized
investments under section 11A.24. The income earned or realized on the investment may also be
applied to the payment of the appropriation bonds to be refunded or interest or premiums on the
refunded appropriation bonds, or to pay interest on the refunding bonds. After the terms of the
escrow have been fully satisfied, any balance of the proceeds and any investment income may be
returned to the general fund or, if applicable, the special appropriation stadium bond proceeds fund
for use in any lawful manner. All refunding bonds issued under this subdivision must be prepared,
executed, delivered, and secured by appropriations in the same manner as the appropriation bonds
to be refunded.
   Subd. 5. Appropriation bonds as legal investments. Any of the following entities may legally
invest any sinking funds, money, or other funds belonging to them or under their control in any
appropriation bonds issued under this section:
   (1) the state, the investment board, public officers, municipal corporations, political subdivisions,
and public bodies;
117TH DAY]                           TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2012                                        7179

   (2) banks and bankers, savings and loan associations, credit unions, trust companies, savings
banks and institutions, investment companies, insurance companies, insurance associations, and
other persons carrying on a banking or insurance business; and
   (3) personal representatives, guardians, trustees, and other fiduciaries.
    Subd. 6. No full faith and credit; state not required to make appropriations. The
appropriation bonds are not public debt of the state, and the full faith, credit, and taxing powers of
the state are not pledged to the payment of the appropriation bonds or to any payment that the state
agrees to make under this section. Appropriation bonds shall not be obligations paid directly, in
whole or in part, from a tax of statewide application on any class of property, income, transaction,
or privilege. Appropriation bonds shall be payable in each fiscal year only from amounts that the
legislature may appropriate for debt service for any fiscal year, provided that nothing in this section
shall be construed to require the state to appropriate funds sufficient to make debt service payments
with respect to the appropriation bonds in any fiscal year. Appropriation bonds shall be canceled
and shall no longer be outstanding on the earlier of (1) the first day of a fiscal year for which the
legislature shall not have appropriated amounts sufficient for debt service, or (2) the date of final
payment of the principal of and interest on the appropriation bonds.
    Subd. 7. Appropriation of proceeds. The proceeds of appropriation bonds and interest credited
to the special appropriation stadium bond proceeds fund are appropriated to the commissioner for
payment of capital expenses, including capitalized interest, debt service on outstanding indebtedness
of the state, operating and capital reserves of the authority, each as permitted by state and federal
law, and nonsalary expenses incurred in conjunction with the sale of the appropriation bonds, and
such proceeds may be granted, loaned, or otherwise provided to the authority for the public purpose

   Subd. 4. General fund allocations. The commissioner must retain and deposit to the general
fund the following amounts, as required by subdivision 3, clause (3):
    (1) for state bond debt service support beginning in calendar year 2021, and for each calendar
year thereafter through calendar year 2046, periodic amounts so that not later than December
31, 2046, an aggregate amount equal to a present value of $150,000,000 has been deposited in
the general fund. To determine aggregate present value, the commissioner must consult with the
commissioner of management and budget regarding the present value dates, discount rate or rates,
and schedules of annual amounts. The present value date or dates must be based on the date or dates
bonds are sold under section 16A.965, or the date or dates other state funds, if any, are deposited
into the construction fund. The discount rate or rates must be based on the true interest cost of the
bonds issued under section 16A.965, or an equivalent 30-year bond index, as determined by the
commissioner of management and budget. The schedule of annual amounts must be certified to the
commissioner by the commissioner of management and budget and the finance officer of the city;
    (2) for the capital improvement reserve appropriation to the stadium authority beginning in
calendar year 2021, and for each calendar year thereafter through calendar year 2056, an aggregate
annual amount equal to the amount paid by the state for this purpose in that calendar year under
section 473J.13, subdivision 4;
   (3) for the operating expense appropriation to stadium authority beginning in calendar year
2021, and for each calendar year thereafter through calendar year 2056, an aggregate annual amount
equal to the amount paid by the state for this purpose in that calendar year under section 473J.13,
subdivision 2;
    (4) for recapture of state advances for the city share of capital improvements and operating
expenses for calendar years 2016 through 2020 beginning in calendar year 2021, and for each
calendar year thereafter until all amounts under this clause have been paid, proportionate amounts
periodically until an aggregate amount equal to the present value of all amounts paid by the state
have been deposited in the general fund. To determine the present value of the amounts paid by
the state to the authority and the present value of amounts deposited to the general fund under this
clause, the commissioner shall consult with the commissioner of management and budget regarding
the present value dates, discount rate or rates, and schedule of annual amounts. The present value
dates must be based on the dates state funds are paid to the authority, or the dates the commissioner
of revenue deposits taxes for purposes of this clause to the general fund. The discount rates must
be based on the reasonably equivalent cost of state funds as determined by the commissioner of
management and budget. The schedule of annual amounts must be revised to reflect amounts paid
under section 473J.13, subdivision 2, paragraph (b), and subdivision 4, paragraph (c), and taxes
deposited to the general fund from time to time under this clause, and the schedule and revised
schedules must be certified to the commissioner by the commissioner of management and budget
and the finance officer of the city, and are transferred as accrued from the general fund for repayment
of advances made by the state to the authority; and
   (5) to capture increases in taxes imposed under the special law, for the benefit of the stadium
authority, beginning in calendar year 2013 and for each calendar year thereafter through 2046, there
shall be deposited to the general fund in proportionate periodic payments in the following year, an
amount equal to the following:

    (ii) 25 percent of the difference, if any, by which the amount of the net annual taxes for the
preceding year exceeds the sum of the net actual taxes in calendar year 2011 plus $3,000,000, inflated
at two percent per year since 2011.
    Sec. 2. Laws 1986, chapter 396, section 4, as amended by Laws 1987, chapter 55, sections 5 and

Statutes, chapter 297A that occur within the city, and may also by ordinance impose an additional

    (c) The tax must be assessed by the commissioner. An assessment must be considered a jeopardy
assessment or jeopardy collection as provided in section 270C.36. The commissioner shall assess the
tax based on personal knowledge or information available to the commissioner. The commissioner
shall mail to the taxpayer at the taxpayer's last known address, or serve in person, a written notice
of the amount of tax, demand its immediate payment, and, if payment is not immediately made,
collect the tax by any method described in chapter 270C, except that the commissioner need not
await the expiration of the times specified in chapter 270C. The tax assessed by the commissioner
is presumed to be valid and correctly determined and assessed. The burden is upon the taxpayer
to show its incorrectness or invalidity. The tax imposed under this subdivision does not apply to
gambling that is exempt from taxation under subdivision 2.

   Sec. 11. [297E.021] SPECIAL ALLOCATION OF REVENUES.
   Subdivision 1. Application; revenues not pledged. The provisions of this subdivision apply
only after the issuance of appropriation bonds under section 16A.965, subdivision 2, but do not
constitute a pledge of available revenues as security for payment of principal and interest on
appropriation bonds issued under section 16A.965.
    Subd. 2. Determination of revenue increase. By March 15 of each fiscal year, the commissioner
of management and budget, in consultation with the commissioner, shall determine the estimated
increase in revenues received from taxes imposed under this chapter over the estimated revenues
under the February 2012 state budget forecast for that fiscal year. For fiscal years after fiscal year
2015, the commissioner of management and budget shall use the February 2012 state budget forecast
for fiscal year 2015 as the baseline. All calculations under this subdivision must be made net of
estimated refunds of the taxes required to be paid.
   Subd. 3. Definition of available revenues. For purposes of this section, "available revenues"
equals the amount determined under subdivision 2:
   (1) reduced by the following amounts paid for the fiscal year under:
   (i) the appropriation to principal and interest on appropriation bonds under section 16A.965,
subdivision 8;
   (ii) the appropriation from the general fund to make operating expense payments under section
473J.13, subdivision 2, paragraph (b);
   (iii) the appropriation for contributions to the capital reserve fund under section 473J.13,
subdivision 4, paragraph (c);
   (iv) the appropriations under this article for administration and any successor appropriation;
   (v) the reduction in revenues resulting from the property tax exemptions under section 473J.19;
   (vi) the reduction in revenues resulting from the sales tax exemptions under section 297A.71,
subdivisions 43 and 44; and
    (vii) the compulsive gambling appropriations under section 297E.02, subdivision 3, paragraph
(c), and any successor appropriation;
    (2) increased by the revenue deposited in the general fund under section 297A.994, subdivision
4, paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (3), for the fiscal year; and
   (3) increased by the revenue deposited in the special revenue fund through revenue generated
under section 473J.14.
    Subd. 4. Appropriation; general reserve account. To the extent the commissioner determines
that revenues are available under subdivision 4, clause (2), for the fiscal year, those amounts are
appropriated from the general fund for deposit in a general reserve account established by order
7190                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [117TH DAY

of the commissioner of management and budget. Amounts in this reserve are appropriated as
necessary for application against any shortfall in the amounts deposited to the general fund under
section 297A.994 or chapter 297E, relative to the February 2012 forecast. After consultation with
the legislative commission on planning and fiscal policy, amounts in this reserve are appropriated
to the commissioner of management and budget for other uses related to the stadium authorized
under section 473J.03, subdivision 7, that the commissioner deems financially prudent including
reimbursements for capital and operating costs relating to the stadium, refundings, and prepayment
of debt. In no event, shall available revenues be pledged, nor shall the appropriations of available
revenues made by this section constitute a pledge of available revenues as security for the
prepayment of principal and interest on the appropriation bonds under section 16A.965.
    Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 297E.13, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Untaxed gambling equipment. It is a gross misdemeanor for a person to possess
gambling equipment for resale in this state that has not been stamped or bar-coded in accordance
with this chapter and chapter 349 and upon which the taxes imposed by chapter 297A or section

   Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.163, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Paper pull-tab and tipboard flares. (a) A manufacturer may not ship or cause to be
shipped into this state or sell for use or resale in this state any deal of paper pull-tabs or tipboards
that does not have its own individual flare as required for that deal by this subdivision and rule of the
board. A person other than a manufacturer may not manufacture, alter, modify, or otherwise change
a flare for a deal of paper pull-tabs or tipboards except as allowed by this chapter or board rules.
    (b) The flare of each paper pull-tab and tipboard game must have affixed to or imprinted at the
bottom a bar code that provides all information required by the commissioner of revenue under
section 297E.04, subdivision 2.
    The serial number included in the bar code must be the same as the serial number of the tickets
included in the deal. A manufacturer who manufactures a deal of paper pull-tabs must affix to the
outside of the box containing that game the same bar code that is affixed to or imprinted at the
bottom of a flare for that deal.
7204                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [117TH DAY

    (c) No person may alter the bar code that appears on the outside of a box containing a deal of
paper pull-tabs and tipboards. Possession of a box containing a deal of paper pull-tabs and tipboards
that has a bar code different from the bar code of the deal inside the box is prima facie evidence that
the possessor has altered the bar code on the box.
    (d) The flare of each deal of paper pull-tabs and tipboards sold by a manufacturer for use or resale
in Minnesota must have imprinted on it a symbol that is at least one inch high and one inch wide
consisting of an outline of the geographic boundaries of Minnesota with the letters "MN" inside the
outline. The flare must be placed inside the wrapping of the deal which the flare describes.
    (e) Each paper pull-tab and tipboard flare must bear the following statement printed in letters
large enough to be clearly legible:
   "Pull-tab (or tipboard) purchasers ­ This pull-tab (or tipboard) game is not legal in Minnesota
unless:
   ­ an outline of Minnesota with letters "MN" inside it is imprinted on this sheet, and
   ­ the serial number imprinted on the bar code at the bottom of this sheet is the same as the serial
number on the pull-tab (or tipboard) ticket you have purchased."
   (f) The flare of each paper pull-tab and tipboard game must have the serial number of the game
imprinted on the bar code at the bottom of the flare in numerals at least one-half inch high.

subdivision, a manufacturer is also required to submit the applicable version of any software
necessary to operate electronic devices and related systems.
    (b) The board shall inspect and test all the equipment, including software and software upgrades,
it deems necessary to determine the equipment's compliance with law and board rules. Samples
required under this subdivision must be approved by the board before the equipment being sampled
is shipped into or sold for use or resale in this state. The board shall impose a fee of $25 for each item
of gambling equipment that the manufacturer submits for approval or for which the manufacturer
requests approval. The board shall impose a fee of $100 for each sample of gambling equipment
that it tests.
    (c) The board may require samples of gambling equipment to be tested by an independent testing
laboratory prior to submission to the board for approval. All costs of testing by an independent
testing laboratory must be borne by the manufacturer. An independent testing laboratory used by
a manufacturer to test samples of gambling equipment must be approved by the board before the
equipment is submitted to the laboratory for testing.
    (d) The board may request the assistance of the commissioner of public safety and the director
of the State Lottery in performing the tests.

to distributors for services provided under subdivision 5; and
   (3) any other information required by the board by rule.
   Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.1635, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Linked bingo game services requirements. (a) A linked bingo game provider must

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2012.
     Sec. 54. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.19, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Pull-tab records. (a) The board shall by rule require a licensed organization to require
each winner of a paper pull-tab prize of $50 or more to present identification in the form of a driver's
license, Minnesota identification card, or other identification the board deems sufficient to allow the
identification and tracking of the winner. The rule must require the organization to retain winning
paper pull-tabs of $50 or more, and the identification of the winner of the pull-tab, for 3-1/2 years.
    (b) An organization must maintain separate cash banks for each deal of paper pull-tabs unless
(1) the licensed organization uses a pull-tab dispensing device, or (2) the organization uses a cash
register, of a type approved by the board, which records all sales of paper pull-tabs by separate deals.
     (c) The board shall:
    (1) by rule adopt minimum technical standards for cash registers that may be used by
organizations, and shall approve for use by organizations any cash register that meets the standards;
and
    (2) before allowing an organization to use a cash register that commingles receipts from several
different paper pull-tab games in play, adopt rules that define how cash registers may be used and
that establish a procedure for organizations to reconcile all pull-tab games in play at the end of each
month.

The legislature finds that continuous legislative review of the financial management of the
authority is necessary to promote fiscal responsibility and good management, and strengthen the
accountability of the authority. The commission is charged with:
   (1) providing financial oversight of the authority as described in subdivision 8;

facilities and entertainment venues under the jurisdiction of the authority. The authority membership

by this section.
    Subd. 4. Chair. The commission must meet as soon as practicable after members are appointed
in each odd-numbered year to elect its chair and other officers as it may determine necessary. A
chair serves a two-year term, expiring in the odd-numbered year after a successor is elected. The
chair must alternate biennially between the senate and the house of representatives.
    Subd. 5. Compensation. Members serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for their
reasonable expenses as members of the legislature.
   Subd. 6. Staff. Legislative staff must provide administrative and research assistance to the
commission.
   Subd. 7. Meetings; procedures. The commission meets at least semiannually. If there is a
quorum, the commission may take action by a simple majority vote of commission members
present.
    Subd. 8. Powers; duties; Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority, budget oversight. The
commission must monitor, review, and make recommendations to the authority and to the
legislature for the following calendar year on:
   (1) any proposed increases in the rate or dollar amount of tax;
   (2) any proposed increases in the debt of the authority;
   (3) the overall work and role of the authority;
   (4) the authority's proposed operating and capital budgets;
   (5) the authority's implementation of the operating and capital budgets; and

   Sec. 5. [473J.01] PURPOSE.
    The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the construction, financing, and long-term use of
a stadium and related stadium infrastructure as a venue for professional football and a broad range
of other civic, community, athletic, educational, cultural, and commercial activities. The legislature
finds and declares that the expenditure of public money for this purpose is necessary and serves
a public purpose, and that property acquired by the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority for the
construction of the stadium and related stadium infrastructure is acquired for a public use or public
purpose under chapter 117. The legislature further finds and declares that any provision in a lease
or use agreement with a professional football team that requires the team to play all of its home
games in a publicly funded stadium for the duration of the lease or use agreement, serves a unique
public purpose for which the remedies of specific performance and injunctive relief are essential to

its enforcement. The legislature further finds and declares that government assistance to facilitate
the presence of professional football provides to the state of Minnesota and its citizens highly valued
intangible benefits that are virtually impossible to quantify and, therefore, not recoverable even if
the government receives monetary damages in the event of a team's breach of contract. Minnesota
courts are, therefore, charged with protecting those benefits through the use of specific performance
and injunctive relief as provided in this chapter and in the lease and use agreements.

team will be reimbursed by the authority for the incremental, out-of-pocket expenses to operate the
stadium during such events and uses.
    Subd. 4. Capital improvements. (a) The NFL team shall be responsible for making, or for
causing others to make, all capital repairs, replacements, and improvements for the stadium and
stadium infrastructure and shall establish a capital reserve fund for such purposes. The NFL team
shall maintain, or cause others to maintain, the stadium and stadium infrastructure in a safe, clean,
attractive, and first class manner so as to cause them to remain in a condition comparable to that of
other comparable NFL facilities of similar design and age. The NFL team shall maintain, or cause
others to maintain, the stadium and parking facilities in a manner that is consistent with all applicable
requirements imposed by the NFL, and with the original design and construction program of the
stadium and parking facilities. The NFL team shall make, or cause others to make, all necessary
or appropriate repairs, renewals, and replacements, whether structural or nonstructural, interior or
exterior, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen, in a prompt and timely manner. The
authority, with approval of the NFL team, may enter into an agreement with a program manager to
perform some or all of the responsibilities of the NFL team in this subdivision and to assume and
accept financial liability for the cost of performing the responsibilities.
   (b) The NFL team must contribute $1,500,000 each year for the term of the lease or use
agreement to the capital reserve fund, increased by a three percent annual inflation rate.
    (c) The NFL team, with input from the authority, shall develop short-term and long-term
capital funding plans and shall use those plans to guide the future capital needs of the stadium and
stadium infrastructure. The NFL team, after consultation with the authority, shall make the final
determination with respect to funding capital needs. Any capital improvement proposed by the
authority, except those intended primarily to provide revenue enhancements to the NFL team shall

be paid for by the authority, unless otherwise agreed to by the NFL team.
    Subd. 5. Cooperation with financing. The authority will cooperate with the NFL team to
facilitate the financing of the NFL team's contribution. Such agreement to cooperate shall not
require the authority to incur any additional costs or provide conduit financing. The lease, license,
and other transaction documents shall include provisions customarily required by lenders in
stadium financings.
   Sec. 15. [473J.15] CRITERIA AND CONDITIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Binding and enforceable. In developing the stadium and entering into related
contracts, the authority must follow and enforce the criteria and conditions in this section, provided
that a determination by the authority that those criteria or conditions have been met under any
agreement or otherwise shall be conclusive.
    Subd. 2. NFL team/private contribution; timing of expenditures. (a) The NFL team/private
contribution, including stadium builder license proceeds, for stadium costs must be made in cash in
the amount of at least $427,000,000.
    (b) Prior to the initial deposit of funds under this section, the team must provide security or
other credit worthiness in the amount of $50,000,000, subject to the satisfaction of the authority.
Prior to the first issuance of bonds under section 16A.965, the first portion of the NFL team/private
contribution in the amount of $50,000,000 must be deposited as costs are incurred to the construction
fund to pay for the initial stadium costs.
    (c) After the first $50,000,000 of stadium costs have been paid from the initial NFL team/private
contribution, state funds shall be deposited as costs are incurred to the construction fund to pay
for the next $50,000,000 of costs of the project. Prior to any state funds being deposited in the
construction fund, the NFL team must provide security or a financing commitment reasonably
satisfactory to the authority for the balance of the required NFL team/private contribution and for
payment of cost overruns if the NFL team assumes responsibility for stadium construction under
section 473J.11. Thereafter, budgeted project costs shall be borne by the authority and the NFL
team/private contributions in amounts proportionate to their remaining funding commitments.
   (d) In the event the project terminates before the initial $100,000,000 in contributions are
expended by the parties under this subdivision, the parties shall be reimbursed in the amounts
they have deposited to the construction fund proportionate to project funding percentages, in the
amounts of 56 percent by the authority and 44 percent by the NFL team/private contributions.
    Subd. 3. Lease or use agreements; 40-year term. The authority must enter into a long-term
lease or use agreement with the NFL team for the NFL team's use of the stadium. The NFL team must
agree to play all preseason, regular season, and postseason home games at the stadium. Training
facilities must remain in Minnesota during the term of the lease or use agreement. The lease or
use agreement must be for a term of at least 40 years from the date of substantial completion of
the stadium for professional football games. The lease or use agreement may provide options for
the NFL team to extend the term for up to four additional periods of five years. The lease or use
agreement must include terms for default, termination, and breach of the agreement. Recognizing
that the presence of professional football provides to the state of Minnesota and its citizens highly
valued, intangible benefits that are virtually impossible to quantify and, therefore, not recoverable
in the event of the NFL team owner's breach of contract, the lease and use agreements must provide
7240                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [117TH DAY

for specific performance and injunctive relief to enforce provisions relating to use of the stadium for
professional football and must not include escape clauses or buyout provisions. The NFL team must
not enter into or accept any agreement or requirement with or from any entity that is inconsistent
with the NFL team's binding commitment to the 40-year term of the lease or use agreement or that
would in any manner dilute, interfere with, or negate the provisions of the lease or use agreement,
providing for specific performance or injunctive relief. The legislature conclusively determines, as a
matter of public policy, that the lease or use agreement, and any grant agreement under this chapter
that includes a specific performance clause:
   (1) explicitly authorizes specific performance as a remedy for breach;
   (2) is made for adequate consideration and upon terms which are otherwise fair and reasonable;
   (3) has not been included through sharp practice, misrepresentation, or mistake;
    (4) if specifically enforced, does not cause unreasonable or disproportionate hardship or loss to
the NFL team or to third parties; and
    (5) involves performance in a manner and the rendering of services of a nature and under
circumstances that the beneficiary cannot be adequately compensated in damages.
    Subd. 4. Lease or use agreements; revenues, payments. A lease or use agreement shall include
rent and other fees and expenses to be paid by the NFL team. The authority shall agree to provide
in the lease or use agreement for the NFL team to receive all NFL and team event related revenues,
including, but not limited to, suite revenues, advertising, concessions, signage, broadcast and media,
and club seat revenue. The agreement shall also provide that all naming rights to the stadium are
retained by the NFL team, subject to the approval of the name or names by the authority consistent
with those criteria set out in the lease or use agreement. The agreement shall provide for the authority
to receive all general ticket revenues and other event revenues other than from NFL team games,
NFL team-owned major league soccer games, and other NFL team events agreed to by the authority.
    Subd. 5. Notice of breach or default. Until 40 years from the date of stadium completion, the
NFL team must provide written notice to the authority not less than 180 days prior to any action,
including any action imposed upon the NFL team by the NFL, which would result in a breach or
default of provisions of the lease or use agreements required to be included under subdivision 3. If
this notice provision is violated and the NFL team has already breached or been in default under the
required provisions, the authority or the state of Minnesota may specifically enforce the lease or use
agreement and Minnesota courts shall fashion equitable remedies so that the NFL team fulfills the
conditions of the lease and use agreements.
    Subd. 6. Enforceable financial commitments. The authority must determine before stadium
construction begins that all public and private funding sources for construction, operating expenses,
and capital improvements and repairs of the stadium are included in written agreements. The
committed funds must be adequate to design, construct, furnish, and equip the stadium, and pay
projected operating expenses and the costs of capital improvements and repairs during the term
of the lease or use agreement with the NFL team. The NFL team must provide the authority
access to NFL team financial or other information, which the authority deems necessary for
such determination. Any financial information obtained by the authority under this subdivision is
nonpublic data under section 13.02, subdivision 9.
117TH DAY]                           TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2012                                         7241

   Subd. 7. Environmental requirements. The authority must comply with all environmental
requirements imposed by regulatory agencies for the stadium, site, and structure, except as provided
by section 473J.09, subdivision 11, or by section 473J.17.
    Subd. 8. Public share on sale of NFL team. The lease or use agreement must provide that, if
the NFL team is sold or an interest in the NFL team is sold after the effective date of this chapter,
a portion of the sale price must be used to pay down the remaining debt service. If any portion
remains after debt service is paid, that amount is paid to the authority and deposited in a reserve fund
for improvements to the stadium or expended as the authority may otherwise direct. The portion
required to be so paid to the authority is 25 percent of the amount in excess of the purchase price of
the NFL team by the selling owner or owners for the first ten years declining to zero 15 years after
commencement of stadium construction, declining to 15 percent for the next ten years, and further
declining to ten percent for the next ten years. The agreement must provide exceptions for sales to
members of the owners' family and entities and trusts beneficially owned by family members, sales
to employees of equity interests aggregating up to ten percent, sales related to capital infusions
not distributed to the owners, and sales amongst existing owners not exceeding 20 percent equity
interest in the NFL team.
    Subd. 9. Authority's access to NFL team financial information. A notice provision for a
material breach shall be agreed to between the authority and the NFL team. In the event there is a
material breach by the NFL team under the lease or use agreement, the lease or use agreement must
provide the authority access to audited financial statements of the NFL team and other financial
information that the authority deems necessary to enforce the terms of any lease or use agreements.
Any financial information obtained by the authority under this subdivision is nonpublic data under
section 13.02, subdivision 9.
    Subd. 10. NFL team name retained. The lease or use agreement must provide that the NFL
team and NFL will transfer to the state of Minnesota the Minnesota Vikings' heritage and records,
including the name, logo, colors, history, playing records, trophies, and memorabilia in the event of
relocation of the NFL team in violation of the lease or use agreement.
   Subd. 11. Stadium design. (a) The authority and the NFL team will build a stadium that is
environmentally and energy efficient and will make an effort to build a stadium that is eligible
to receive the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification or the
Green Building Initiative Green Globes certification for environmental design, and to the extent
practicable, will strive to make the stadium design architecturally significant.
    (b) The stadium design must, to the extent feasible, follow sustainable building guidelines
established under section 16B.325.
    (c) The authority and the team must ensure that the stadium be constructed with steel made in
the USA.
    Subd. 12. Necessary approvals. The authority and the NFL team must secure any necessary
approvals to the terms of the lease and use agreement and the design and construction plans for the
stadium, including prior approval of the NFL.
   Subd. 13. Affordable access. The lease or use agreement must provide for an agreed-upon
number of affordable tickets to the professional sporting events held in the stadium.
7242                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [117TH DAY

    Subd. 14. Stadium builder's licenses. The authority shall own and retain the exclusive right to
sell stadium builder's licenses in the stadium. The authority will retain the NFL team to act as the
authority's agent in marketing and selling such licenses.
    Subd. 15. Major league soccer. The authority shall, for five years after the first NFL team home
game is played in the stadium, grant the NFL team the exclusive right to establish major league
soccer at the stadium. The authority and the NFL team may enter into an agreement providing the
terms and conditions of such an arrangement, provided:
    (1) if any of the NFL team owners whose family owns at least three percent of the NFL team
purchases full or partial ownership in a major league soccer franchise, such franchise may play
in the stadium under a use agreement with similar terms as are applicable to the NFL team at no
additional rent, but including a provision of payment of game-day costs and reasonable marginal
costs incurred by the authority as a result of the major league soccer team; and
  (2) capital improvements required by a major league soccer franchise must be financed by the
owners of the major league soccer team, unless otherwise agreed to by the authority.
    Subd. 16. NFL team-related entities. Subject to the prior approval of the authority, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, any of the obligations by the NFL team may be performed by the NFL
team, a related entity, or a third party, and the NFL team, any entity related to the NFL team or third
party may receive any revenues to which the NFL team is entitled hereunder; provided, however,
the NFL team shall remain liable if any obligations are assigned to a related entity or third party.
   Sec. 16. [473J.17] COUNTY ACTIVITIES.
    Subdivision 1. Property acquisition and disposition. The county may, to the extent legally
permissible, acquire land, air rights, and other property interests within the stadium area and convey
them to the authority without consideration, prepare a site for development as a stadium, and
acquire and construct any related stadium infrastructure, if any, as provided in the county/authority
agreement. To the extent property parcels or interests acquired are more extensive than the stadium
infrastructure requirements, the county may sell or otherwise dispose of the excess. The legislature
intends that, except as expressly limited herein, the county may acquire, remediate, and dispose
of the development area within the site.
   Subd. 2. Claims. Except as may be mutually agreed to by the county and the authority, the county
has no interest in or claim to any assets or revenues of the authority.
    Subd. 3. Environmental; planning and zoning. The county is the responsible governmental
unit for an environmental impact statement for the stadium project prepared under section 116D.04,
if an environmental impact statement is necessary. Notwithstanding section 116D.04, subdivision
2b, and implementing rules:
    (1) the environmental impact statement shall not be required to consider alternative stadium
sites; and
    (2) the environmental impact statement must be determined to be adequate before commencing
work on the foundation of the stadium, but the stadium and stadium infrastructure may otherwise
be started and all preliminary and final government decisions and actions may be made and taken
including, but not limited to, acquiring land; obtaining financing; granting permits or other land
use approvals; entering into grant, lease, or use agreements; or preparing the site or related stadium
117TH DAY]                           TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2012                                         7243

infrastructure prior to a determination of the adequacy of the environmental impact statement.
    Subd. 4. County expenditure. The county may make expenditures or grants for other costs
incidental and necessary to further the purposes of this chapter and may, by agreement, reimburse
in whole or in part, any entity that has granted, loaned, or advanced funds to the county to further the
purposes of this chapter. Notwithstanding any law, ordinance, or charter provision to the contrary,
exercise by the county of its powers under this section does not affect the amount that the county
may otherwise spend, borrow, tax, or receive.
    Subd. 5. County authority. The legislature intends that, except as expressly limited herein,
the county may enter into contracts with the authority, the NFL team and other governmental or
nongovernmental entities, appropriate funds, and make employees, consultants, and other revenues
available for those purposes.
    Subd. 6. Stadium implementation committee; city review. In order to accomplish the
objectives of this act within the required time frame, it is necessary to establish an alternative
process for municipal land use and development review. It is hereby found and declared that
the construction of a stadium within the stadium area is consistent with the city's adopted
comprehensive plan, is the preferred stadium location, and is a permitted land use. This subdivision
establishes a procedure for all land and water use and development reviews and approvals by the
city and watershed district for the stadium and related stadium infrastructure and supersedes all
land use and development rules and restrictions and procedures imposed by other law, charter,
or ordinance including, without limitation, section 15.99 and chapters 103A to 103G. No later
than 30 days after enactment, the city shall establish a stadium implementation committee with
representation from the city, county, and watershed district to make recommendations on the
design plans submitted for the stadium, stadium infrastructure, and related improvements. The
implementation committee must take action to issue its recommendations within the time frames
established in the planning and construction timetable issued by the authority, which shall provide
for no less than 60 days for the committee's review. The recommendations of the implementation
committee shall be forwarded to the city's planning commission for an advisory recommendation
and then to the city council for final action in a single resolution. Final action must be taken
within 45 days of the submission of the recommendations to the planning commission. The
watershed district must act within 45 days of the implementation committee's recommendations.
The city council and watershed district shall not impose any unreasonable conditions on the
recommendations of the implementation committee, nor take any action or impose any conditions
that will result in delay from the time frames established in the planning and construction timetable
or in additional overall costs. Failure of the city council or watershed district to act within the
45-day period shall be deemed to be approval by that entity of the implementation committee's
recommendations. The authority or county may seek de novo review in the district court of any
city council or watershed district action. The district court or any appellate court shall expedite
review to the maximum extent possible and timely issue relief, orders, or opinions necessary to
give effect to the provisions and objectives in this act.
    Subd. 7. Suburban Ramsey County referendum and tax. Subject to approval by a referendum
in all municipalities within Ramsey County, with the exception of a city of the first class, and
notwithstanding section 477A.016, the county is authorized to impose a sales tax of two percent
on the sale of fermented malt beverages, retail on-sale liquor, and food purchased at restaurants
and other commercial establishments located in Ramsey County except for those sales within a city
7244                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [117TH DAY

of the first class. The referendum shall be conducted as part of the 2012 general election. If the
referendum receives the approval of a majority voting on the issue, the county shall impose the
taxes approved and the revenue raised shall be remitted to the commissioner of revenue for deposit
in the general fund. The commissioner shall allocate the revenues deposited toward payment of
the costs associated with the off-site roadway and transportation infrastructure improvements along
marked Interstate Highway 694 including the marked Interstate Highway 35/694 interchange as
identified by the Ramsey County Department of Public Works. The ballot question shall state that
the proposed tax revenues are legally required to be used for the specified roadway and transportation
infrastructure improvements.
   Sec. 17. [473J.25] METROPOLITAN SPORTS FACILITIES COMMISSION ASSETS;
LIABILITIES TO AUTHORITY.
    Subdivision 1. Authority expenses. The Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission shall pay
the operating expenses of the authority including salaries, compensation, and other personnel, office,
equipment, consultant and any other costs, until the commission is abolished pursuant to subdivision
3.
   Subd. 2. Transfer. Within 90 days of the enactment of this chapter, the Metropolitan Sports
Facilities Commission shall pay its outstanding obligations, settle its accounts, and transfer its
remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations to the authority, for its purposes.
    Subd. 3. Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission abolished; interim powers conferred
on authority. Upon transfer to the authority of all remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations of
the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, in subdivision 2, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities
Commission is abolished. When the remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations of the Metropolitan
Sports Facilities Commission have been transferred to the authority and the commission has been
abolished, the powers and duties of the commission under sections 473.551 to 473.599, and any
other law shall devolve upon the authority, in addition to the powers and duties of the authority
under this chapter, until the first NFL home game is played at the stadium.
    Subd. 4. Employees. Upon transfer of ownership all persons employed by the Metropolitan
Sports Facilities Commission shall be transferred to the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority
without loss of right or privilege. Nothing in this section shall be construed to give any such person
the right or privilege to continue in the same level or classification of employment previously held.
The Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority may assign any such person to an employment level and
classification which it deems appropriate and desirable in accordance with its personnel code.
   Sec. 18. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Except as otherwise provided, this article is effective the day following final enactment.

from licensing.
   Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.162, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Sales from facilities. (a) All gambling equipment purchased or possessed by a licensed
distributor for resale or lease to any person for use in Minnesota must, prior to the equipment's
resale or lease, be unloaded into a storage facility located in Minnesota which the distributor owns
or leases; and which has been registered, in advance and in writing, with the Division of Alcohol and
Gambling Enforcement as a storage facility of the distributor. All unregistered gambling equipment
and all unaffixed registration stamps owned by, or in the possession of, a licensed distributor in the
state of Minnesota shall be stored at a storage facility which has been registered with the Division of
Alcohol and Gambling Enforcement. No gambling equipment may be moved from the facility unless
the gambling equipment has been first registered with the board or the Department of Revenue. A
distributor must notify the board of the method that it will use to sell and transfer electronic pull-tab
games to licensed organizations, and must receive approval of the board before implementing or
making changes to the approved method.
    (b) Notwithstanding section 349.163, subdivisions 5, 6, and 8, a licensed manufacturer may
ship into Minnesota approved or unapproved gambling equipment if the licensed manufacturer
ships the gambling equipment to a Minnesota storage facility that is: (1) owned or leased by the
licensed manufacturer; and (2) registered, in advance and in writing, with the Division of Alcohol
and Gambling Enforcement as a manufacturer's storage facility. No gambling equipment may be
shipped into Minnesota to the manufacturer's registered storage facility unless the shipment of
the gambling equipment is reported to the Department of Revenue in a manner prescribed by the
department. No gambling equipment may be moved from the storage facility unless the gambling
equipment is sold to a licensed distributor and is otherwise in conformity with this chapter, is
shipped to an out-of-state site and the shipment is reported to the Department of Revenue in a
manner prescribed by the department, or is otherwise sold and shipped as permitted by board
rule. A manufacturer must notify the board of the method that it will use to sell and transfer

electronic pull-tab games to licensed distributors, and must receive approval of the board before
implementing or making changes to the approved method.
    (c) All storage facilities owned, leased, used, or operated by a licensed distributor or
manufacturer may be entered upon and inspected by the employees of the Division of Alcohol and
Gambling Enforcement, the Division of Alcohol and Gambling Enforcement director's authorized
representatives, employees of the Gambling Control Board or its authorized representatives,
employees of the Department of Revenue, or authorized representatives of the director of the
Division of Special Taxes of the Department of Revenue during reasonable and regular business
hours. Obstruction of, or failure to permit, entry and inspection is cause for revocation or suspension
of a manufacturer's or distributor's licenses and permits issued under this chapter.
    (d) Unregistered gambling equipment found at any location in Minnesota other than the
manufacturing plant of a licensed manufacturer or a registered storage facility are contraband under
section 349.2125. This paragraph does not apply:
    (1) to unregistered gambling equipment being transported in interstate commerce between
locations outside this state, if the interstate shipment is verified by a bill of lading or other valid
shipping document; and
    (2) to gambling equipment registered with the Department of Revenue for distribution to the
tribal casinos.
   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.163, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. License required. No manufacturer of gambling equipment may sell any
gambling equipment to any person for use or resale within the state, unless the manufacturer has
a current and valid license issued by the board under this section and has satisfied other criteria
prescribed by the board by rule. A manufacturer licensed under this section may also be licensed
as a linked bingo game provider under section 349.1635.
    A manufacturer licensed under this section may not also be directly or indirectly licensed as a
distributor under section 349.161.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.163, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Paper pull-tab and tipboard flares. (a) A manufacturer may not ship or cause to be
shipped into this state or sell for use or resale in this state any deal of paper pull-tabs or tipboards
that does not have its own individual flare as required for that deal by this subdivision and rule of the
board. A person other than a manufacturer may not manufacture, alter, modify, or otherwise change
a flare for a deal of paper pull-tabs or tipboards except as allowed by this chapter or board rules.
    (b) The flare of each paper pull-tab and tipboard game must have affixed to or imprinted at the
bottom a bar code that provides all information required by the commissioner of revenue under
section 297E.04, subdivision 2.
    The serial number included in the bar code must be the same as the serial number of the tickets
included in the deal. A manufacturer who manufactures a deal of paper pull-tabs must affix to the
outside of the box containing that game the same bar code that is affixed to or imprinted at the
bottom of a flare for that deal.
7262                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [117TH DAY

    (c) No person may alter the bar code that appears on the outside of a box containing a deal of
paper pull-tabs and tipboards. Possession of a box containing a deal of paper pull-tabs and tipboards
that has a bar code different from the bar code of the deal inside the box is prima facie evidence that
the possessor has altered the bar code on the box.
    (d) The flare of each deal of paper pull-tabs and tipboards sold by a manufacturer for use or resale
in Minnesota must have imprinted on it a symbol that is at least one inch high and one inch wide
consisting of an outline of the geographic boundaries of Minnesota with the letters "MN" inside the
outline. The flare must be placed inside the wrapping of the deal which the flare describes.
    (e) Each paper pull-tab and tipboard flare must bear the following statement printed in letters
large enough to be clearly legible:
   "Pull-tab (or tipboard) purchasers ­ This pull-tab (or tipboard) game is not legal in Minnesota
unless:
   ­ an outline of Minnesota with letters "MN" inside it is imprinted on this sheet, and
   ­ the serial number imprinted on the bar code at the bottom of this sheet is the same as the serial
number on the pull-tab (or tipboard) ticket you have purchased."
   (f) The flare of each paper pull-tab and tipboard game must have the serial number of the game
imprinted on the bar code at the bottom of the flare in numerals at least one-half inch high.
   Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.163, subdivision 6, is amended to read:

subdivision, a manufacturer is also required to submit the applicable version of any software
necessary to operate electronic devices and related systems.
    (b) The board shall inspect and test all the equipment, including software and software upgrades,
it deems necessary to determine the equipment's compliance with law and board rules. Samples
required under this subdivision must be approved by the board before the equipment being sampled
is shipped into or sold for use or resale in this state. The board shall impose a fee of $25 for each item
of gambling equipment that the manufacturer submits for approval or for which the manufacturer
requests approval. The board shall impose a fee of $100 for each sample of gambling equipment
that it tests.
    (c) The board may require samples of gambling equipment to be tested by an independent testing
laboratory prior to submission to the board for approval. All costs of testing by an independent
testing laboratory must be borne by the manufacturer. An independent testing laboratory used by
a manufacturer to test samples of gambling equipment must be approved by the board before the
equipment is submitted to the laboratory for testing.
    (d) The board may request the assistance of the commissioner of public safety and the director
of the State Lottery in performing the tests.

    (1) evidence of a bond in the principal amount of $100,000 payable to the state of Minnesota
conditioned on the payment of all linked bingo prizes and any other money due and payable under
this chapter;
    (2) detailed plans and specifications for the operation of the linked bingo game and the linked
bingo system, along with a proposed fee schedule for the cost of providing services and equipment to
licensed organizations which may not exceed 15 percent of gross profits, unless a higher percentage,
not to exceed 20 percent, is authorized by the board. The fee schedule must incorporate costs paid
to distributors for services provided under subdivision 5; and
   (3) any other information required by the board by rule.
   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.1635, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Linked bingo game services requirements. (a) A linked bingo game provider must
contract with licensed distributors for linked bingo game services including, but not limited to, the
solicitation of agreements with licensed organizations, and installation, repair, or maintenance of
the linked bingo game system.
   (b) A distributor may not charge a fee to licensed organizations for services authorized and
rendered under paragraph (a).
   (c) A linked bingo game provider may not contract with any distributor on an exclusive basis.

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2012.
     Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.19, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Pull-tab records. (a) The board shall by rule require a licensed organization to require
each winner of a paper pull-tab prize of $50 or more to present identification in the form of a driver's
license, Minnesota identification card, or other identification the board deems sufficient to allow the
identification and tracking of the winner. The rule must require the organization to retain winning
paper pull-tabs of $50 or more, and the identification of the winner of the pull-tab, for 3-1/2 years.
    (b) An organization must maintain separate cash banks for each deal of paper pull-tabs unless
(1) the licensed organization uses a pull-tab dispensing device, or (2) the organization uses a cash
register, of a type approved by the board, which records all sales of paper pull-tabs by separate deals.
     (c) The board shall:
    (1) by rule adopt minimum technical standards for cash registers that may be used by
organizations, and shall approve for use by organizations any cash register that meets the standards;
and
    (2) before allowing an organization to use a cash register that commingles receipts from several
different paper pull-tab games in play, adopt rules that define how cash registers may be used and
that establish a procedure for organizations to reconcile all pull-tab games in play at the end of each
month.

is presumed to be valid and correctly determined and assessed. The burden is upon the taxpayer
to show its incorrectness or invalidity. The tax imposed under this subdivision does not apply to
gambling that is exempt from taxation under subdivision 2.

the state of Minnesota, to be remitted in a timely manner upon completion of the agreement and
certification by the state that a White Earth tribal casino is allowed to operate per the negotiated
agreement;
   (2) a requirement that the State Lottery lease the slot machines to the casino and that the
Department of Public Safety provide inspections, licensing, and oversight of casino operations to
ensure the public trust;

   Sec. 5. [473J.01] PURPOSE.
    The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the construction, financing, and long-term use of
a stadium and related stadium infrastructure as a venue for professional football and a broad range
of other civic, community, athletic, educational, cultural, and commercial activities. The legislature
finds and declares that the expenditure of public money for this purpose is necessary and serves
a public purpose, and that property acquired by the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority for the
construction of the stadium and related stadium infrastructure is acquired for a public use or public
purpose under chapter 117. The legislature further finds and declares that any provision in a lease
or use agreement with a professional football team that requires the team to play all of its home
games in a publicly funded stadium for the duration of the lease or use agreement, serves a unique
public purpose for which the remedies of specific performance and injunctive relief are essential to
its enforcement. The legislature further finds and declares that government assistance to facilitate
the presence of professional football provides to the state of Minnesota and its citizens highly valued
intangible benefits that are virtually impossible to quantify and, therefore, not recoverable even if
the government receives monetary damages in the event of a team's breach of contract. Minnesota
courts are, therefore, charged with protecting those benefits through the use of specific performance
and injunctive relief as provided in this chapter and in the lease and use agreements.

   Sec. 11. [473J.11] STADIUM DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION.
    Subdivision 1. Contracts. (a) The design, development, and construction of the stadium shall

   (b) Unless the authority and the NFL team agree otherwise:
    (1) the authority shall create a stadium design and construction group, including representatives

    (d) The authority and the NFL team shall prepare a request for proposals for one or more of the
functions described in paragraph (c). The request must be published in the State Register and shall
include, at a minimum, such requirements that are agreed to by the authority and the NFL team.
The authority and the NFL team may prequalify offerors by issuing a request for qualifications, in
advance of the request for proposals, and select a short list of responsible offerors prior to discussions
and evaluations.
    (e) As provided in the request for proposals, the authority, and the NFL team, may conduct
discussions and negotiations with responsible offerors in order to determine which proposal is most
advantageous to the authority and the NFL team and to negotiate the terms of an agreement. In
conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals
submitted by competing offerors and the content of all proposals is nonpublic data under chapter
13 until such time as a notice to award a contract is given by the authority. The agreement shall be
subject to the approval of the NFL team.
    (f) Prior to the time the authority enters into a construction contract with a construction manager
or program manager certifying a maximum price and a completion date as provided in paragraph
(h), at the request of the NFL team, the authority may authorize, such authorization not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, the NFL team to provide for management of the construction of
the stadium and related stadium infrastructure, in which event the NFL team must assume the role
and responsibilities of the authority for completion of construction in a manner consistent with the
agreed minimum design standards and design documents, subject to the terms of this act, including
responsibility for cost overruns.
    (g) The construction manager or program manager may enter into contracts with contractors for
labor, materials, supplies, and equipment for the construction of the stadium and related stadium
infrastructure through the process of public bidding, except that the construction manager or
program manager may, with the consent of the authority or the NFL team if the NFL team has
assumed responsibility for construction:
  (1) narrow the listing of eligible bidders to those which the construction manager or program
manager determines to possess sufficient expertise to perform the intended functions;
    (2) award contracts to the contractors that the construction manager or program manager
determines provide the best value under a request for proposals as described in section 16C.28,
subdivision 1, paragraphs (a), clause (2), and (c), which are not required to be the lowest responsible
bidder; and
     (3) for work the construction manager or program manager determines to be critical to the
completion schedule, award contracts on the basis of competitive proposals, or perform work with
its own forces without soliciting competitive bids if the construction manager or program manager
provides evidence of competitive pricing.
    (h) The authority and the NFL team shall require that the construction manager or program
manager certify, before the contract is signed, a fixed and stipulated construction price and
completion date to the authority and post a performance bond in an amount at least equal to 100
percent of the certified price or such other security satisfactory to the authority, to cover any costs
which may be incurred in excess of the certified price including, but not limited to, costs incurred
by the authority or loss of revenues resulting from incomplete construction on the completion
date. The authority may secure surety bonds as provided in section 574.26, securing payment of

just claims in connection with all public work undertaken by the authority. Persons entitled to the
protection of the bonds may enforce them as provided in sections 574.28 to 574.32 and are not
entitled to a lien on any property of the authority under the provisions of sections 514.01 to 514.16.
The construction of the stadium is a project as that term is defined in section 177.42, subdivision 2,
and is subject to the prevailing wage law under sections 177.41 to 177.43.
    Subd. 2. Changes. Unless otherwise agreed to by the authority and the NFL team, if either party
requests an agreed upon change in minimum design standards, and this change is responsible for
requiring the project to exceed the stated budget, the requesting party is liable for any cost overruns
or associated liabilities.
   Subd. 3. Stadium design. The stadium and stadium infrastructure shall be designed and
constructed incorporating the following general program and design elements:

   (6) elements sufficient to provide community and civic uses as determined by the authority; and
   (7) a roof that is retractable.
   Subd. 4. Cost overruns, savings. The NFL team shall pay any cost overruns. Cost savings or

   Sec. 12. [473J.112] COMMEMORATIVE BRICKS.
   The authority shall sell commemorative bricks to be displayed at a prominent location in the
new stadium, for an amount to be determined by the authority. The authority shall work with the
commissioner to ensure that purchase of a brick is a tax deductible donation on the part of the
donating person or organization. Funds raised through this section shall be appropriated to the
commissioner of management and budget for a grant to the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority.
   Sec. 13. [473J.12] EMPLOYMENT.
7290                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [117TH DAY

    Subdivision 1. Hiring and recruitment. In the design, development, construction, management,
operation, maintenance and capital repair, replacement and improvement of the stadium and
stadium infrastructure, the authority shall make every effort to employ, and cause the NFL team,
the construction manager and other subcontractors, vendors, and concessionaires to employ women
and members of minority communities when hiring. In addition, the authority shall contract with
an employment assistance firm, preferably minority-owned, to create an employment program to
recruit, hire, and retain minorities for the stadium facility. The authority shall hold a job fair and
recruit and advertise at Minneapolis Urban League, Sabathani, American Indian OIC, Youthbuild
organizations, and other such organizations. Further, goals for construction contracts to be awarded
to women- and minority-owned businesses will be in a percentage at least equal to the minimum
used for city of Minneapolis development projects, and the other construction workforce will
establish workforce utilization goals at least equal to current city goals and include workers from
city zip codes that have high rates of poverty and unemployment.
    Subd. 2. Other required agreements. The NFL team or the authority shall give food, beverage,
retail, and concession workers presently employed by the NFL team or the Metropolitan Sports

under a collective bargaining agreement may seek to continue such representation in the facility
and designate such, or another collective bargaining unit, as their representative.
   Subd. 3. Volunteer workers. Volunteer workers for high school league events shall not be
required to be members of employment unions.
   Sec. 14. [473J.13] STADIUM OPERATIONS; CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Stadium operation. The stadium shall be operated in a first-class manner, similar
to and consistent with other comparable NFL stadiums, such as the stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana,
currently known as Lucas Oil Field. The authority and the team will mutually agree on a third-party
management company or individual to manage the stadium and on certain major vendors to the
stadium. The authority, with the approval of the NFL team, may enter into an agreement with a
program manager for management of the stadium, for a maximum of 40 years.
   Subd. 2. Operating expenses. (a) The authority must pay or cause to be paid all operating
expenses of the stadium. The authority must require in the lease or use agreement with the NFL

2016 is a payment by the state, which shall be repaid to the state, using funds as provided under
section 297A.994, subdivision 4, paragraph (a), clause (4). After 2020, the state shall assume this
payment, using funds generated in accordance with the city of Minneapolis as specified under
section 297A.994.
    (c) The authority may establish an operating reserve to cover operating expense shortfalls and
may accept funds from any source for deposit in the operating reserve. The establishment or funding
of an authority operating reserve must not decrease the amounts required to be paid to the authority
117TH DAY]                           TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2012                                       7291

toward operating costs under this subdivision unless agreed to by the authority.
   (d) The authority will be responsible for operating cost overruns.
    (e) After the joint selection of the third-party manager or program manager, the authority
may agree with a program manager or other third-party manager of the stadium on a fixed cost
operating, management, or employment agreement with operating cost protections under which
the program manager or third-party manager assumes responsibility for stadium operating costs
and shortfalls. The agreement with the manager must require the manager to prepare an initial and
ongoing operating plan and operating budgets for approval by the authority in consultation with
the NFL team. The manager must agree to operate the stadium in accordance with the approved
operating plan and operating budget.
   Subd. 3. Public access. The authority will work to maximize access for public and amateur
sports, community, and civic events, and other public events in type and on terms consistent with
those currently held at the existing football stadium, as defined in section 473.551, subdivision 9.

replacements, and improvements for the stadium and stadium infrastructure. The authority shall
maintain, or cause others to maintain, the stadium and stadium infrastructure in a safe, clean,
attractive, and first-class manner so as to cause them to remain in a condition comparable to that
of other comparable NFL facilities of similar design and age. The authority shall make, or cause
others to make, all necessary or appropriate repairs, renewals, and replacements, whether structural
or nonstructural, interior or exterior, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen, in a prompt
and timely manner. In addition, the authority, with approval of the NFL team, may enter into an
agreement with a program manager to perform some or all of the responsibilities of the authority
in this subdivision and to assume and accept financial liability for the cost of performing the
responsibilities.
    (b) The NFL team must contribute $1,500,000 each year, beginning in 2016 or as otherwise
determined for the term of the lease or use agreement to the operating reserve fund, increased by a
three percent annual inflation rate.
    (c) The state shall contribute $1,500,000 each year, beginning in 2016 or as otherwise determined
for the term of the lease to the operating reserve fund. The contributions of the state are subject to
increase by an annual adjustment factor. The contribution under this paragraph shall be assumed by
the state from 2016 through 2020, and repaid to the state by the state using funds in accordance with
section 297A.994, subdivision 4, paragraph (a), clause (4).
    (d) The authority, with input from the NFL team, shall develop short-term and long-term capital
funding plans and shall use those plans to guide the future capital needs of the stadium and stadium
infrastructure. The authority shall make the final determination with respect to funding capital
needs. Any capital improvement proposed by the NFL team intended primarily to provide revenue
enhancements to the NFL team shall be paid for by the NFL team, unless otherwise agreed to with
the authority.
   Subd. 5. Game-day payments. In addition to operating expense contributions of the NFL
7292                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [117TH DAY

team under subdivision 2, the NFL team shall pay all NFL game day, NFL team-owned major
league soccer, as provided in section 473J.15, subdivision 15, and other NFL team-sponsored event
expenses within the stadium and stadium plaza areas.
    Subd. 6. Cooperation with financing. The authority will cooperate with the NFL team to
facilitate the financing of the NFL team's contribution. Such agreement to cooperate shall not
require the authority to incur any additional costs or provide conduit financing. The lease, license,
and other transaction documents shall include provisions customarily required by lenders in
stadium financings.
   Sec. 15. [473J.15] CRITERIA AND CONDITIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Binding and enforceable. In developing the stadium and entering into related
contracts, the authority must follow and enforce the criteria and conditions in this section, provided
that a determination by the authority that those criteria or conditions have been met under any
agreement or otherwise shall be conclusive.
    Subd. 2. NFL team/private contribution; timing of expenditures. (a) The NFL team/private
contribution, including stadium builder license proceeds, for stadium costs must be made in cash in
the amount of at least $427,000,000.
    (b) Prior to the initial deposit of funds under this section, the team must provide security or
other credit worthiness in the amount of $50,000,000, subject to the satisfaction of the authority.
Prior to the first issuance of bonds under section 16A.965, the first portion of the NFL team/private
contribution in the amount of $50,000,000 must be deposited as costs are incurred to the construction
fund to pay for the initial stadium costs.
    (c) After the first $50,000,000 of stadium costs have been paid from the initial NFL team/private
contribution, state funds shall be deposited as costs are incurred to the construction fund to pay
for the next $50,000,000 of costs of the project. Prior to any state funds being deposited in the
construction fund, the NFL team must provide security or a financing commitment reasonably
satisfactory to the authority for the balance of the required NFL team/private contribution and for
payment of cost overruns if the NFL team assumes responsibility for stadium construction under
section 473J.11. Thereafter, budgeted project costs shall be borne by the authority and the NFL
team/private contributions in amounts proportionate to their remaining funding commitments.
   (d) In the event the project terminates before the initial $100,000,000 in contributions are
expended by the parties under this subdivision, the parties shall be reimbursed in the amounts
they have deposited to the construction fund proportionate to project funding percentages, in the
amounts of 56 percent by the authority and 44 percent by the NFL team/private contributions.
    Subd. 3. Lease or use agreements; 40-year term. The authority must enter into a long-term
lease or use agreement with the NFL team for the NFL team's use of the stadium. The NFL team must
agree to play all preseason, regular season, and postseason home games at the stadium. Training
facilities must remain in Minnesota during the term of the lease or use agreement. The lease or
use agreement must be for a term of at least 40 years from the date of substantial completion of
the stadium for professional football games. The lease or use agreement may provide options for
the NFL team to extend the term for up to four additional periods of five years. The lease or use
agreement must include terms for default, termination, and breach of the agreement. Recognizing
that the presence of professional football provides to the state of Minnesota and its citizens highly
117TH DAY]                           TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2012                                         7293

valued, intangible benefits that are virtually impossible to quantify and, therefore, not recoverable
in the event of the NFL team owner's breach of contract, the lease and use agreements must provide
for specific performance and injunctive relief to enforce provisions relating to use of the stadium for
professional football and must not include escape clauses or buyout provisions. The NFL team must
not enter into or accept any agreement or requirement with or from any entity that is inconsistent
with the NFL team's binding commitment to the 40-year term of the lease or use agreement or that
would in any manner dilute, interfere with, or negate the provisions of the lease or use agreement,
providing for specific performance or injunctive relief. The legislature conclusively determines, as a
matter of public policy, that the lease or use agreement, and any grant agreement under this chapter
that includes a specific performance clause:
   (1) explicitly authorizes specific performance as a remedy for breach;
   (2) is made for adequate consideration and upon terms which are otherwise fair and reasonable;
   (3) has not been included through sharp practice, misrepresentation, or mistake;
    (4) if specifically enforced, does not cause unreasonable or disproportionate hardship or loss to
the NFL team or to third parties; and
    (5) involves performance in a manner and the rendering of services of a nature and under
circumstances that the beneficiary cannot be adequately compensated in damages.
    Subd. 4. Lease or use agreements; revenues, payments. A lease or use agreement shall include
rent and other fees and expenses to be paid by the NFL team. The authority shall agree to provide
in the lease or use agreement for the NFL team to receive all NFL and team event related revenues,
including, but not limited to, suite revenues, advertising, concessions, signage, broadcast and media,
and club seat revenue. The agreement shall also provide that all naming rights to the stadium are
retained by the NFL team, subject to the approval of the name or names by the authority consistent
with those criteria set out in the lease or use agreement. The agreement shall provide for the authority
to receive all general ticket revenues and other event revenues other than from NFL team games,
NFL team-owned major league soccer games, and other NFL team events agreed to by the authority.
    Subd. 5. Notice of breach or default. Until 40 years from the date of stadium completion, the
NFL team must provide written notice to the authority not less than 180 days prior to any action,
including any action imposed upon the NFL team by the NFL, which would result in a breach or
default of provisions of the lease or use agreements required to be included under subdivision 3. If
this notice provision is violated and the NFL team has already breached or been in default under the
required provisions, the authority or the state of Minnesota may specifically enforce the lease or use
agreement and Minnesota courts shall fashion equitable remedies so that the NFL team fulfills the
conditions of the lease and use agreements.
    Subd. 6. Enforceable financial commitments. The authority must determine before stadium
construction begins that all public and private funding sources for construction, operating expenses,
and capital improvements and repairs of the stadium are included in written agreements. The
committed funds must be adequate to design, construct, furnish, and equip the stadium, and pay
projected operating expenses and the costs of capital improvements and repairs during the term
of the lease or use agreement with the NFL team. The NFL team must provide the authority
access to NFL team financial or other information, which the authority deems necessary for
such determination. Any financial information obtained by the authority under this subdivision is
7294                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [117TH DAY

nonpublic data under section 13.02, subdivision 9.
   Subd. 7. Environmental requirements. The authority must comply with all environmental
requirements imposed by regulatory agencies for the stadium, site, and structure, except as provided
by section 473J.09, subdivision 11, or by section 473J.17.
    Subd. 8. Public share on sale of NFL team. The lease or use agreement must provide that, if
the NFL team is sold or an interest in the NFL team is sold after the effective date of this chapter,
a portion of the sale price must be used to pay down the remaining debt service. If any portion
remains after debt service is paid, that amount is paid to the authority and deposited in a reserve fund
for improvements to the stadium or expended as the authority may otherwise direct. The portion
required to be so paid to the authority is 25 percent of the amount in excess of the purchase price of
the NFL team by the selling owner or owners for the first ten years after commencement of stadium
construction, declining to 15 percent for the next ten years, and further declining to ten percent for
the next ten years. The agreement must provide exceptions for sales to members of the owners'
family and entities and trusts beneficially owned by family members, sales to employees of equity
interests aggregating up to ten percent, sales related to capital infusions not distributed to the owners,
and sales amongst existing owners not exceeding 20 percent equity interest in the NFL team.
    Subd. 9. Authority's access to NFL team financial information. A notice provision for a
material breach shall be agreed to between the authority and the NFL team. In the event there is a
material breach by the NFL team under the lease or use agreement, the lease or use agreement must
provide the authority access to audited financial statements of the NFL team and other financial
information that the authority deems necessary to enforce the terms of any lease or use agreements.
Any financial information obtained by the authority under this subdivision is nonpublic data under
section 13.02, subdivision 9.
    Subd. 10. NFL team name retained. The lease or use agreement must provide that the NFL
team and NFL will transfer to the state of Minnesota the Minnesota Vikings' heritage and records,
including the name, logo, colors, history, playing records, trophies, and memorabilia in the event of
relocation of the NFL team in violation of the lease or use agreement.
   Subd. 11. Stadium design. (a) The authority and the NFL team will build a stadium that is
environmentally and energy efficient and will make an effort to build a stadium that is eligible
to receive the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification or the
Green Building Initiative Green Globes certification for environmental design, and to the extent
practicable, will strive to make the stadium design architecturally significant.
    (b) The stadium design must, to the extent feasible, follow sustainable building guidelines
established under section 16B.325.
    (c) The authority and the team must ensure that the stadium be constructed with steel made in
the USA.
    Subd. 12. Necessary approvals. The authority and the NFL team must secure any necessary
approvals to the terms of the lease and use agreement and the design and construction plans for the
stadium, including prior approval of the NFL.
   Subd. 13. Affordable access. The lease or use agreement must provide for an agreed-upon
number of affordable tickets to the professional sporting events held in the stadium.
117TH DAY]                           TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2012                                        7295

    Subd. 14. Stadium builder's licenses. The authority shall own and retain the exclusive right to
sell stadium builder's licenses in the stadium. The authority will retain the NFL team to act as the
authority's agent in marketing and selling such licenses.
    Subd. 15. Major league soccer. The authority shall, for five years after the first NFL team home
game is played in the stadium, grant the NFL team the exclusive right to establish major league
soccer at the stadium. The authority and the NFL team may enter into an agreement providing the
terms and conditions of such an arrangement, provided:
    (1) if any of the NFL team owners whose family owns at least three percent of the NFL team
purchases full or partial ownership in a major league soccer franchise, such franchise may play
in the stadium under a use agreement with similar terms as are applicable to the NFL team at no
additional rent for a term of five years, but including a provision of payment of game-day costs and
reasonable marginal costs incurred by the authority as a result of the major league soccer team. The
soccer franchise shall have use of the stadium rent-free for five years only for league-sanctioned
matches; use of the facility for any other days or functions shall be under terms and conditions to be
negotiated by the authority and the NFL team. After the initial five-year term of the use agreement,
the NFL team and the authority shall negotiate a use agreement consistent with market rates; and
  (2) capital improvements required by a major league soccer franchise must be financed by the
owners of the major league soccer team, unless otherwise agreed to by the authority.
    Subd. 16. NFL team-related entities. Subject to the prior approval of the authority, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, any of the obligations by the NFL team may be performed by the NFL
team, a related entity, or a third party, and the NFL team, any entity related to the NFL team or third
party may receive any revenues to which the NFL team is entitled hereunder; provided, however,
the NFL team shall remain liable if any obligations are assigned to a related entity or third party.
   Sec. 16. [473J.17] MUNICIPAL ACTIVITIES.
    Subdivision 1. Property acquisition and disposition. The city may, to the extent legally
permissible, acquire land, air rights, and other property interests within the development area
for the stadium site and stadium infrastructure and convey it to the authority with or without
consideration, prepare a site for development as a stadium, and acquire and construct any related
stadium infrastructure. To the extent property parcels or interests acquired are more extensive than
the stadium infrastructure requirements, the city may sell or otherwise dispose of the excess.
    Subd. 2. Claims. Except as may be mutually agreed to by the city and the authority, the city has
no interest in or claim to any assets or revenues of the authority.
    Subd. 3. Environmental; planning and zoning. The authority is the responsible governmental
unit for an environmental impact statement for the stadium prepared under section 116D.04, if an
environmental impact statement is necessary. Notwithstanding section 116D.04, subdivision 2b,
and implementing rules: (1) the environmental impact statement shall not be required to consider
alternative stadium sites; and (2) the environmental impact statement must be determined to be
adequate before commencing work on the foundation of the stadium, but the stadium and stadium
infrastructure may otherwise be started and all preliminary and final government decisions and
actions may be made and taken including, but not limited to, acquiring land; obtaining financing;
granting permits or other land use approvals; entering into grant, lease, or use agreements; or
preparing the site or related stadium infrastructure prior to a determination of the adequacy of the

    Subd. 4. Local government expenditure. The city may make expenditures or grants for other
costs incidental and necessary to further the purposes of this chapter and may, by agreement,
reimburse in whole or in part, any entity that has granted, loaned, or advanced funds to the city to
further the purposes of this chapter. The city may reimburse the authority or a local governmental
entity or make a grant to the authority or such a governmental unit or be reimbursed by the authority
or local governmental entity for site acquisition, preparation of the site for stadium development,
and stadium infrastructure.
    Subd. 5. Municipal authority. The legislature intends that, except as expressly limited herein,
the city may acquire and develop stadium infrastructure, enter into contracts with the authority
and other governmental or nongovernmental entities, appropriate funds, and make employees,
consultants, and other revenues available for those purposes.
     Subd. 6. Stadium Implementation Committee; city review. In order to accomplish the
objectives of this act within the required time frame, it is necessary to establish an alternative
process for municipal land use and development review. It is hereby found and declared that
the construction of a stadium within the development area is consistent with the adopted area
plan, is the preferred stadium location, and is a permitted land use. This subdivision establishes a
procedure for all land use and development reviews and approvals by the city of Minneapolis for
the stadium and related stadium infrastructure and supersedes all land use and development rules
and restrictions and procedures imposed by other law, charter, or ordinance, including without
limitation section 15.99. No later than 30 days after timely compliance of the city as provided in
article 4, section 5, of this act, the city of Minneapolis shall establish a stadium implementation
committee to make recommendations on the design plans submitted for the stadium, and stadium
infrastructure, and related improvements. The implementation committee must take action to issue
its recommendations within the time frames established in the planning and construction timetable
issued by the authority which shall provide for no less than 60 days for the committee's review. The
recommendations of the implementation committee shall be forwarded to the city of Minneapolis
Planning Commission for an advisory recommendation and then to the city council for final action
in a single resolution, which final action must be taken within 45 days of the submission of the
recommendations to the planning commission. The city council shall not impose any unreasonable
conditions on the recommendations of the implementation committee, nor take any action or
impose any conditions that will result in delay from the time frames established in the planning
and construction timetable or in additional overall costs. Failure of the city council to act within
the 45-day period shall be deemed to be approval. The authority may seek de novo review in the
district court of any city council action. The district court or any appellate court shall expedite
review to the maximum extent possible and timely issue relief, orders, or opinions as necessary to
give effect to the provisions and objectives in this act.
   Sec. 17. [473J.19] PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION; SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
    Any real or personal property acquired, owned, leased, controlled, used, or occupied by the
authority for any of the purposes of this chapter, is acquired, owned, leased, controlled, used, and
occupied for public, governmental, and municipal purposes. The stadium and stadium infrastructure
are exempt from ad valorem taxation by the state or any political subdivision of the state provided
that the properties are subject to special assessments levied by a political subdivision for a local
improvement in amounts proportionate to and not exceeding the special benefit received by the

properties from the improvement. No possible use of any of the properties in any manner different
from their use under this chapter may be considered in determining the special benefit received by
the properties. Notwithstanding section 272.01, subdivision 2, or 273.19, real or personal property,
which is subject to a lease or use agreement between the authority and another person for uses related
to the purposes of this chapter, including the operation of the stadium and related parking facilities,
is exempt from taxation regardless of the length of the lease or use agreement or the characteristics
of the entity leasing or using the property. This section, insofar as it provides an exemption or special
treatment, does not apply to any real property that is leased for residential, business, or commercial
development or to a restaurant that is open for general business more than 200 days a year, or other
purposes different from those contemplated in this chapter.
   Sec. 18. [473J.23] LOCAL TAXES.
    No new or additional local sales or use tax shall be imposed on sales at the stadium site unless the
tax is applicable throughout the taxing jurisdiction. No new or additional local tax shall be imposed
on sales of tickets and admissions to NFL team, NFL team-owned major league soccer, or other
team related events at the stadium, notwithstanding any law or ordinance, unless the tax is applicable
throughout the taxing jurisdiction. The admissions and amusements tax currently imposed by the
city of Minneapolis pursuant to Laws 1969, chapter 1092, may apply to admissions for football and
NFL team related events, including NFL team-owned major league soccer, as provided in section
473J.15, subdivision 15, at the stadium.
   Sec. 19. [473J.25] METROPOLITAN SPORTS FACILITIES COMMISSION ASSETS;
LIABILITIES TO AUTHORITY.

on authority. Upon transfer to the authority of all remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations of
the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, in subdivision 2, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities
Commission is abolished. When the remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations of the Metropolitan
Sports Facilities Commission have been transferred to the authority and the commission has been
abolished, the powers and duties of the commission under sections 473.551 to 473.599, and any
other law shall devolve upon the authority, in addition to the powers and duties of the authority
under this chapter, until the first NFL home game is played at the stadium.
    Subd. 4. Employees. Upon transfer of ownership all persons employed by the Metropolitan
Sports Facilities Commission shall be transferred to the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority
without loss of right or privilege. Nothing in this section shall be construed to give any such person
the right or privilege to continue in the same level or classification of employment previously held.
The Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority may assign any such person to an employment level and
classification which it deems appropriate and desirable in accordance with its personnel code.

deposits for debt service reserve funds, and costs of credit enhancement for achieving the purposes
authorized as provided under paragraph (a), and pay debt service, pay costs of issuance, make

agreements entered into under paragraph (d); provided, however, that revenue bonds issued and
unpaid shall not exceed $725,000,000 in principal amount, excluding refunding bonds sold and
issued under subdivision 4.
    (c) Revenue bonds may be issued from time to time in one or more series on the terms and
conditions the commissioner determines to be in the best interests of the state, but the term on any
series of revenue bonds may not exceed 30 years. The revenue bonds of each issue and series thereof
shall be dated and bear interest, and may be includable in or excludable from the gross income of
the owners for federal income tax purposes.
    (d) At the time of, or in anticipation of, issuing the revenue bonds, and at any time thereafter,

Commission rules and regulations in Code of Federal Regulations, title 17, section 240.15c 2-12.

   (e) Notwithstanding any other law, revenue bonds issued under this section shall be fully
negotiable.

for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds then outstanding, including the payment of any
redemption premiums on the bonds, any interest accrued or to accrue to the redemption date, and
costs related to the issuance and sale of the refunding bonds. The proceeds of any refunding bonds
may, in the discretion of the commissioner, be applied to the purchase or payment at maturity of the
revenue bonds to be refunded, to the redemption of the outstanding revenue bonds on any redemption
date, or to pay interest on the refunding bonds and may, pending application, be placed in escrow to
be applied to the purchase, payment, retirement, or redemption. Any escrowed proceeds, pending
such use, may be invested and reinvested in obligations that are authorized investments under section
11A.24. The income earned or realized on the investment may also be applied to the payment of
the revenue bonds to be refunded or interest or premiums on the refunded revenue bonds, or to pay
interest on the refunding bonds. After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied, any balance
of the proceeds and any investment income may be returned to the general fund or, if applicable,
the special revenue stadium bond proceeds fund for use in any lawful manner. All refunding bonds
issued under this subdivision must be prepared, executed, delivered, and secured by appropriations

   (e) The terms defined under section 473J.03 apply for purposes of this section.
    Subd. 3. General allocation of revenues. The commissioner shall remit the revenues from the
taxes, less the deductions listed in this subdivision, to the city at least quarterly. The commissioner
shall make the following deductions in the order listed before distribution to the city:
   (1) refunds of any of these taxes due to taxpayers, if any;
   (2) the costs of collecting and administering the taxes, according to the applicable law and
agreements between the commissioner and the city. For revenues from the general sales tax, the
commissioner must deduct a proportionate share of the cost of collection, as described in section
297A.99, subdivision 11; and
   (3) notwithstanding the provisions of any agreement between the commissioner and the city
providing for collection and remittance of these taxes, the commissioner must deposit to the general
fund the amounts specified in subdivision 4.
   Subd. 4. General fund allocations. The commissioner must retain and deposit to the general
fund the following amounts, as required by subdivision 3, clause (3):
    (1) for the capital improvement reserve appropriation to the stadium authority beginning in
calendar year 2021, and for each calendar year thereafter through calendar year 2056, an aggregate
annual amount equal to the amount paid by the state for this purpose in that calendar year under
section 473J.13, subdivision 4;
   (2) for the operating expense appropriation to stadium authority beginning in calendar year
2021, and for each calendar year thereafter through calendar year 2056, an aggregate annual amount
equal to the amount paid by the state for this purpose in that calendar year under section 473J.13,
subdivision 2;
    (3) for recapture of state advances for the city share of capital improvements and operating
expenses for calendar years 2016 through 2020 beginning in calendar year 2021, and for each
calendar year thereafter until all amounts under this clause have been paid, proportionate amounts
periodically until an aggregate amount equal to the present value of all amounts paid by the state
have been deposited in the general fund. To determine the present value of the amounts paid by
the state to the authority and the present value of amounts deposited to the general fund under this
clause, the commissioner shall consult with the commissioner of management and budget regarding
the present value dates, discount rate or rates, and schedule of annual amounts. The present value
dates must be based on the dates state funds are paid to the authority, or the dates the commissioner
of revenue deposits taxes for purposes of this clause to the general fund. The discount rates must
be based on the reasonably equivalent cost of state funds as determined by the commissioner of
management and budget. The schedule of annual amounts must be revised to reflect amounts paid
under section 473J.13, subdivision 2, paragraph (b), and subdivision 4, paragraph (c), and taxes
deposited to the general fund from time to time under this clause, and the schedule and revised
schedules must be certified to the commissioner by the commissioner of management and budget
and the finance officer of the city, and are transferred as accrued from the general fund for repayment
of advances made by the state to the authority; and

authority, beginning in calendar year 2013 and for each calendar year thereafter through 2046, there

    (10) to impose fees on the racing and card playing industries sufficient to recover the operating
costs of the commission with the approval of the legislature according to section 16A.1283.
Notwithstanding section 16A.1283, when the legislature is not in session, the commissioner of
management and budget may grant interim approval for any new fees or adjustments to existing
fees that are not statutorily specified, until such time as the legislature reconvenes and acts upon
the new fees or adjustments. As part of its biennial budget request, the commission must propose
changes to its fees that will be sufficient to recover the operating costs of the commission.
                                                                                            ­; and
    (11) to take all necessary steps to ensure the security of all activities in a class A licensed
racetrack. The duties and responsibilities of the commission include but are not limited to licensing
employees of a class A licensee and vendors to the class A licensee involved in the conduct of
gaming machines authorized by a location contract with the director of the State Lottery under
section 349A.17 and overall surveillance and security of all conduct on all facilities of a licensed
racetrack. The commission shall require that a class A licensed racetrack reimburse it for the
commission's actual costs, including personnel costs, for conducting activities provided in this
clause and amounts received must be deposited as provided in section 240.155, subdivision 1. The
commission shall review procedures of the class A licensee to ensure compliance with section
240.13, subdivision 5a.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 240.13, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5a. Equine industry improvement fund. (a) To compensate the horse racing industry for
the presence of lottery gaming machines at class A racing facilities, the commission shall establish
and maintain an equine industry improvement fund. Each licensee holding a location contract with
the lottery director shall, as directed by the commission, transmit an amount equal to 12 percent of
the location contract compensation received from the lottery director to the commission for deposit
into the equine industry improvement fund. Seventy-five percent of the funds shall be allocated
for purse supplements. The commission shall routinely transfer 80 percent of the fund allocated
for purse supplements to a licensee conducting live racing for more than one breed of horse and
20 percent to a licensee conducting live racing for only one breed of horse and direct the licensee
to use the funds to supplement purses offered for live races. Purse supplements required under this
subdivision are in addition to purse payments otherwise established by law or contract. The location
contract holder and the organization representing the majority of horsepersons racing at the location
contract holder's racetrack may, by written contract, agree to use a portion of the transferred funds
for racing-related purposes other than purse supplementation.
    (b) The commission shall allocate 20 percent of the fund for breeder's fund purposes and shall
transmit that amount to the breeder's fund for the benefit of each breed racing at a class A licensed
facility hosting lottery gaming machines. Amounts transferred shall be in the same proportions
established, under this subdivision, for purse supplements. Amounts transferred to a breeder's fund
shall be used for the purposes of section 240.18, subdivisions 2, paragraph (d), and 3, paragraph (b),
subject to the proportionality requirement in section 240.18, subdivision 1.
    (c) Five percent of the fund shall be placed in an equine industry enhancement fund established
by the commission. The commission shall award grants from this account designed to support and
improve the nonracing equine industry including, but not limited to, construction of facilities and

trails, production of shows, and issues related to retired horses.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 240.14, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Lottery contract holder; minimum racing days. Licensees holding location contracts
with the director of the lottery, who are authorized to conduct live racing for more than one breed
of horse, shall conduct thoroughbred and quarter horse racing. In any year the licensee shall offer
the equivalent of at least two quarter horse races for each racing day granted to the licensee by the
commission, however, the licensee and the organization representing the majority of quarter horses
owners licensed to race in the state may agree to a different number of live races to be offered.
Scheduling of quarter horse races shall be as approved by the commission pursuant to section 240.03,
clause (8). Willful failure to offer the races required by this subdivision shall subject the licensee to
disciplinary action as deemed appropriate by the commission.
   Sec. 5. [297A.651] LOTTERY GAMING MACHINES; IN-LIEU FEE.
    Adjusted gross revenue from the operation of gaming machines authorized under chapter
349A is exempt from the tax imposed under section 297A.62 and chapter 297E and any other
tax, license, permit, or assessment for conducting a gambling activity that is not imposed by
this section. The State Lottery must, on or before the 20th day of each month, transmit to the
commissioner of revenue an amount equal to the adjusted gross gaming machine revenue from the
operation of gaming machines, as defined in section 349A.01, for the previous month multiplied
by: (1) 25 percent of annual adjusted gross gaming machine revenue generated by each person
that has a location contract under section 349A.17, subdivision 1, up to $150,000,000; (2) 30
percent of annual adjusted gross gaming machine revenue generated by each person that has a
location contract under section 349A.17, subdivision 1, between $150,000,000 and $200,000,000;
and (3) 40 percent of annual adjusted gross gaming machine revenue generated by each person
that has a location contract under section 349A.17, subdivision 1, in excess of $200,000,000. The
commissioner shall deposit the money transmitted under this section in a special revenue account
dedicated to amounts transmitted under this section.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 299L.07, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Exclusions. Notwithstanding subdivision 1, a gambling device:
    (1) may be sold by a person who is not licensed under this section, if the person (i) is not engaged
in the trade or business of selling gambling devices, and (ii) does not sell more than one gambling

    (e) For the purposes of regulating the conditions of use for aerial and audible devices, display
fireworks, sparkling devices, and novelties, a county has the same authority and power granted to

On a retail unitary transaction in which the gross retail income received by the retail merchant is $1
or more, the fireworks user fee is five percent of that gross retail income.
   (e) If the fireworks user fee computed under paragraph (d) results in a fraction of one-half cent
or more, the amount of the fireworks user fee shall be rounded to the next additional cent.
   (f) A retailer liable for collecting the fireworks user fee from a purchaser shall file a return for
each calendar month and pay the fireworks user fees that the retailer has collected during that month.
A retailer shall file the retailer's return for a particular month with the Department of Revenue and
make the retailer's payment of the fireworks user fees collected for that month to the Department of
Revenue not more than 30 days after the end of that month.
    (g) An individual retailer, or an employee, officer, or member of a corporate or partnership
retailer, who has a duty to remit the fireworks user fee under this subdivision to the Department
of Revenue holds the fireworks user fees collected in trust for the state and is personally liable for
the payment of the fireworks user fee money to the state.

   Sec. 5. [473J.01] PURPOSE.
    The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the construction, financing, and long-term use of
a stadium and related stadium infrastructure as a venue for professional football and a broad range
of other civic, community, athletic, educational, cultural, and commercial activities. The legislature
finds and declares that the expenditure of public money for this purpose is necessary and serves
a public purpose, and that property acquired by the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority for the
construction of the stadium and related stadium infrastructure is acquired for a public use or public
purpose under chapter 117. The legislature further finds and declares that any provision in a lease
or use agreement with a professional football team that requires the team to play all of its home
games in a publicly funded stadium for the duration of the lease or use agreement, serves a unique
public purpose for which the remedies of specific performance and injunctive relief are essential to
its enforcement. The legislature further finds and declares that government assistance to facilitate
7332                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [117TH DAY

the presence of professional football provides to the state of Minnesota and its citizens highly valued
intangible benefits that are virtually impossible to quantify and, therefore, not recoverable even if
the government receives monetary damages in the event of a team's breach of contract. Minnesota
courts are, therefore, charged with protecting those benefits through the use of specific performance
and injunctive relief as provided in this chapter and in the lease and use agreements.

to women- and minority-owned businesses will be in a percentage at least equal to the minimum
used for city of Minneapolis development projects, and the other construction workforce will
establish workforce utilization goals at least equal to current city goals and include workers from
city zip codes that have high rates of poverty and unemployment.
    Subd. 2. Other required agreements. The NFL team or the authority shall give food, beverage,
retail, and concession workers presently employed by the NFL team or the Metropolitan Sports
Facilities Commission or its vendors at the existing football stadium the opportunity to continue their
employment in comparable positions at the new stadium. Workers who are presently represented
under a collective bargaining agreement may seek to continue such representation in the facility
and designate such, or another collective bargaining unit, as their representative.
   Subd. 3. Volunteer workers. Volunteer workers for high school league events shall not be
required to be members of employment unions.
   Sec. 14. [473J.13] STADIUM OPERATIONS; CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Stadium operation. The stadium shall be operated in a first-class manner, similar
to and consistent with other comparable NFL stadiums, such as the stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana,
7340                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [117TH DAY

currently known as Lucas Oil Field. The authority and the team will mutually agree on a third-party
management company or individual to manage the stadium and on certain major vendors to the
stadium. The authority, with the approval of the NFL team, may enter into an agreement with a
program manager for management of the stadium, for a maximum of 40 years.
   Subd. 2. Operating expenses. (a) The authority must pay or cause to be paid all operating
expenses of the stadium. The authority must require in the lease or use agreement with the NFL
team that the NFL team pay the authority, beginning January 1, 2016, or other date as mutually
agreed upon by the parties, toward operating costs of the stadium, $8,500,000 each year, increased
by a three percent annual inflation rate.
   (b) Beginning January 1, 2016, or other date as mutually agreed upon by the parties, and
continuing through 2056, the state shall pay the authority operating expenses, $6,000,000 each
year, increased by an annual adjustment factor.
    (c) The authority may establish an operating reserve to cover operating expense shortfalls and
may accept funds from any source for deposit in the operating reserve. The establishment or funding
of an authority operating reserve must not decrease the amounts required to be paid to the authority
toward operating costs under this subdivision unless agreed to by the authority.
   (d) The authority will be responsible for operating cost overruns.
    (e) After the joint selection of the third-party manager or program manager, the authority
may agree with a program manager or other third-party manager of the stadium on a fixed cost
operating, management, or employment agreement with operating cost protections under which
the program manager or third-party manager assumes responsibility for stadium operating costs
and shortfalls. The agreement with the manager must require the manager to prepare an initial and
ongoing operating plan and operating budgets for approval by the authority in consultation with
the NFL team. The manager must agree to operate the stadium in accordance with the approved
operating plan and operating budget.
   Subd. 3. Public access. The authority will work to maximize access for public and amateur
sports, community, and civic events, and other public events in type and on terms consistent with
those currently held at the existing football stadium, as defined in section 473.551, subdivision 9.
The authority may provide that these events have exclusive use of the premises at agreed-upon times
subject to the scheduling rights of the NFL team under the lease or use agreement.
    Subd. 4. Capital improvements. (a) The authority shall establish a capital reserve fund.
The authority shall be responsible for making, or for causing others to make, all capital repairs,
replacements, and improvements for the stadium and stadium infrastructure. The authority shall
maintain, or cause others to maintain, the stadium and stadium infrastructure in a safe, clean,
attractive, and first-class manner so as to cause them to remain in a condition comparable to that
of other comparable NFL facilities of similar design and age. The authority shall make, or cause
others to make, all necessary or appropriate repairs, renewals, and replacements, whether structural
or nonstructural, interior or exterior, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen, in a prompt
and timely manner. In addition, the authority, with approval of the NFL team, may enter into an
agreement with a program manager to perform some or all of the responsibilities of the authority
in this subdivision and to assume and accept financial liability for the cost of performing the
responsibilities.
117TH DAY]                           TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2012                                       7341

    (b) The NFL team must contribute $1,500,000 each year, beginning in 2016 or as otherwise
determined for the term of the lease or use agreement to the operating reserve fund, increased by a
three percent annual inflation rate.
    (c) The state shall contribute $1,500,000 each year, beginning in 2016 or as otherwise determined
for the term of the lease to the operating reserve fund. The contributions of the state are subject to
increase by an annual adjustment factor. The contribution under this paragraph shall be assumed by
the state from 2016 through 2056.
    (d) The authority, with input from the NFL team, shall develop short-term and long-term capital
funding plans and shall use those plans to guide the future capital needs of the stadium and stadium
infrastructure. The authority shall make the final determination with respect to funding capital
needs. Any capital improvement proposed by the NFL team intended primarily to provide revenue
enhancements to the NFL team shall be paid for by the NFL team, unless otherwise agreed to with
the authority.
    Subd. 5. Game-day payments. In addition to operating expense contributions of the NFL
team under subdivision 2, the NFL team shall pay all NFL game day, NFL team-owned major
league soccer, as provided in section 473J.15, subdivision 15, and other NFL team-sponsored event
expenses within the stadium and stadium plaza areas.
    Subd. 6. Cooperation with financing. The authority will cooperate with the NFL team to
facilitate the financing of the NFL team's contribution. Such agreement to cooperate shall not
require the authority to incur any additional costs or provide conduit financing. The lease, license,
and other transaction documents shall include provisions customarily required by lenders in
stadium financings.
   Sec. 15. [473J.15] CRITERIA AND CONDITIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Binding and enforceable. In developing the stadium and entering into related
contracts, the authority must follow and enforce the criteria and conditions in this section, provided
that a determination by the authority that those criteria or conditions have been met under any
agreement or otherwise shall be conclusive.
    Subd. 2. NFL team/private contribution; timing of expenditures. (a) The NFL team/private
contribution, including stadium builder license proceeds, for stadium costs must be made in cash in
the amount of at least $578,000,000.
    (b) Prior to the initial deposit of funds under this section, the team must provide security or
other credit worthiness in the amount of $50,000,000, subject to the satisfaction of the authority.
Prior to the first issuance of bonds under section 16A.965, the first portion of the NFL team/private
contribution in the amount of $50,000,000 must be deposited as costs are incurred to the construction
fund to pay for the initial stadium costs.
    (c) After the first $50,000,000 of stadium costs have been paid from the initial NFL team/private
contribution, state funds shall be deposited as costs are incurred to the construction fund to pay
for the next $50,000,000 of costs of the project. Prior to any state funds being deposited in the
construction fund, the NFL team must provide security or a financing commitment reasonably
satisfactory to the authority for the balance of the required NFL team/private contribution and for
payment of cost overruns if the NFL team assumes responsibility for stadium construction under
7342                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [117TH DAY

section 473J.11. Thereafter, budgeted project costs shall be borne by the authority and the NFL
team/private contributions in amounts proportionate to their remaining funding commitments.
   (d) In the event the project terminates before the initial $100,000,000 in contributions are
expended by the parties under this subdivision, the parties shall be reimbursed in the amounts
they have deposited to the construction fund proportionate to project funding percentages, in the
amounts of 56 percent by the authority and 44 percent by the NFL team/private contributions.
    Subd. 3. Lease or use agreements; 40-year term. The authority must enter into a long-term
lease or use agreement with the NFL team for the NFL team's use of the stadium. The NFL team must
agree to play all preseason, regular season, and postseason home games at the stadium. Training
facilities must remain in Minnesota during the term of the lease or use agreement. The lease or
use agreement must be for a term of at least 40 years from the date of substantial completion of
the stadium for professional football games. The lease or use agreement may provide options for
the NFL team to extend the term for up to four additional periods of five years. The lease or use
agreement must include terms for default, termination, and breach of the agreement. Recognizing
that the presence of professional football provides to the state of Minnesota and its citizens highly
valued, intangible benefits that are virtually impossible to quantify and, therefore, not recoverable
in the event of the NFL team owner's breach of contract, the lease and use agreements must provide
for specific performance and injunctive relief to enforce provisions relating to use of the stadium for
professional football and must not include escape clauses or buyout provisions. The NFL team must
not enter into or accept any agreement or requirement with or from any entity that is inconsistent
with the NFL team's binding commitment to the 40-year term of the lease or use agreement or that
would in any manner dilute, interfere with, or negate the provisions of the lease or use agreement,
providing for specific performance or injunctive relief. The legislature conclusively determines, as a
matter of public policy, that the lease or use agreement, and any grant agreement under this chapter
that includes a specific performance clause:
   (1) explicitly authorizes specific performance as a remedy for breach;
   (2) is made for adequate consideration and upon terms which are otherwise fair and reasonable;
   (3) has not been included through sharp practice, misrepresentation, or mistake;
    (4) if specifically enforced, does not cause unreasonable or disproportionate hardship or loss to
the NFL team or to third parties; and
    (5) involves performance in a manner and the rendering of services of a nature and under
circumstances that the beneficiary cannot be adequately compensated in damages.
    Subd. 4. Lease or use agreements; revenues, payments. A lease or use agreement shall include
rent and other fees and expenses to be paid by the NFL team. The authority shall agree to provide
in the lease or use agreement for the NFL team to receive all NFL and team event related revenues,
including, but not limited to, suite revenues, advertising, concessions, signage, broadcast and media,
and club seat revenue. The agreement shall also provide that all naming rights to the stadium are
retained by the NFL team, subject to the approval of the name or names by the authority consistent
with those criteria set out in the lease or use agreement. The agreement shall provide for the authority
to receive all general ticket revenues and other event revenues other than from NFL team games,
NFL team-owned major league soccer games, and other NFL team events agreed to by the authority.
117TH DAY]                            TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2012                                          7343

    Subd. 5. Notice of breach or default. Until 40 years from the date of stadium completion, the
NFL team must provide written notice to the authority not less than 180 days prior to any action,
including any action imposed upon the NFL team by the NFL, which would result in a breach or
default of provisions of the lease or use agreements required to be included under subdivision 3. If
this notice provision is violated and the NFL team has already breached or been in default under the
required provisions, the authority or the state of Minnesota may specifically enforce the lease or use
agreement and Minnesota courts shall fashion equitable remedies so that the NFL team fulfills the
conditions of the lease and use agreements.
    Subd. 6. Enforceable financial commitments. The authority must determine before stadium
construction begins that all public and private funding sources for construction, operating expenses,
and capital improvements and repairs of the stadium are included in written agreements. The
committed funds must be adequate to design, construct, furnish, and equip the stadium, and pay
projected operating expenses and the costs of capital improvements and repairs during the term
of the lease or use agreement with the NFL team. The NFL team must provide the authority
access to NFL team financial or other information, which the authority deems necessary for
such determination. Any financial information obtained by the authority under this subdivision is
nonpublic data under section 13.02, subdivision 9.
   Subd. 7. Environmental requirements. The authority must comply with all environmental
requirements imposed by regulatory agencies for the stadium, site, and structure, except as provided
by section 473J.09, subdivision 11, or by section 473J.17.
    Subd. 8. Public share on sale of NFL team. The lease or use agreement must provide that, if
the NFL team is sold or an interest in the NFL team is sold after the effective date of this chapter,
a portion of the sale price must be used to pay down the remaining debt service. If any portion
remains after debt service is paid, that amount is paid to the authority and deposited in a reserve fund
for improvements to the stadium or expended as the authority may otherwise direct. The portion
required to be so paid to the authority is 25 percent of the amount in excess of the purchase price of
the NFL team by the selling owner or owners for the first ten years after commencement of stadium
construction, declining to 15 percent for the next ten years, and further declining to ten percent for
the next ten years. The agreement must provide exceptions for sales to members of the owners'
family and entities and trusts beneficially owned by family members, sales to employees of equity
interests aggregating up to ten percent, sales related to capital infusions not distributed to the owners,
and sales amongst existing owners not exceeding 20 percent equity interest in the NFL team.
    Subd. 9. Authority's access to NFL team financial information. A notice provision for a
material breach shall be agreed to between the authority and the NFL team. In the event there is a
material breach by the NFL team under the lease or use agreement, the lease or use agreement must
provide the authority access to audited financial statements of the NFL team and other financial
information that the authority deems necessary to enforce the terms of any lease or use agreements.
Any financial information obtained by the authority under this subdivision is nonpublic data under
section 13.02, subdivision 9.
    Subd. 10. NFL team name retained. The lease or use agreement must provide that the NFL
team and NFL will transfer to the state of Minnesota the Minnesota Vikings' heritage and records,
including the name, logo, colors, history, playing records, trophies, and memorabilia in the event of
relocation of the NFL team in violation of the lease or use agreement.
7344                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [117TH DAY

   Subd. 11. Stadium design. (a) The authority and the NFL team will build a stadium that is
environmentally and energy efficient and will make an effort to build a stadium that is eligible
to receive the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification or the
Green Building Initiative Green Globes certification for environmental design, and to the extent
practicable, will strive to make the stadium design architecturally significant.
    (b) The stadium design must, to the extent feasible, follow sustainable building guidelines
established under section 16B.325.
    (c) The authority and the team must ensure that the stadium be constructed with steel made in
the USA.
    Subd. 12. Necessary approvals. The authority and the NFL team must secure any necessary
approvals to the terms of the lease and use agreement and the design and construction plans for the
stadium, including prior approval of the NFL.
   Subd. 13. Affordable access. The lease or use agreement must provide for an agreed-upon
number of affordable tickets to the professional sporting events held in the stadium.
    Subd. 14. Stadium builder's licenses. The authority shall own and retain the exclusive right to
sell stadium builder's licenses in the stadium. The authority will retain the NFL team to act as the
authority's agent in marketing and selling such licenses.
    Subd. 15. Major league soccer. The authority shall, for five years after the first NFL team home
game is played in the stadium, grant the NFL team the exclusive right to establish major league
soccer at the stadium. The authority and the NFL team may enter into an agreement providing the
terms and conditions of such an arrangement, provided:
    (1) if any of the NFL team owners whose family owns at least three percent of the NFL team
purchases full or partial ownership in a major league soccer franchise, such franchise may play
in the stadium under a use agreement with similar terms as are applicable to the NFL team at no
additional rent for a term of five years, but including a provision of payment of game-day costs and
reasonable marginal costs incurred by the authority as a result of the major league soccer team. The
soccer franchise shall have use of the stadium rent-free for five years only for league-sanctioned
matches; use of the facility for any other days or functions shall be under terms and conditions to be
negotiated by the authority and the NFL team. After the initial five-year term of the use agreement,
the NFL team and the authority shall negotiate a use agreement consistent with market rates; and
  (2) capital improvements required by a major league soccer franchise must be financed by the
owners of the major league soccer team, unless otherwise agreed to by the authority.
    Subd. 16. NFL team-related entities. Subject to the prior approval of the authority, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, any of the obligations by the NFL team may be performed by the NFL
team, a related entity, or a third party, and the NFL team, any entity related to the NFL team or third
party may receive any revenues to which the NFL team is entitled hereunder; provided, however,
the NFL team shall remain liable if any obligations are assigned to a related entity or third party.
   Sec. 16. [473J.17] MUNICIPAL ACTIVITIES.
   Subdivision 1. Property acquisition and disposition. The city may, to the extent legally
permissible, acquire land, air rights, and other property interests within the development area
117TH DAY]                          TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2012                                       7345

for the stadium site and stadium infrastructure and convey it to the authority with or without
consideration, prepare a site for development as a stadium, and acquire and construct any related
stadium infrastructure. To the extent property parcels or interests acquired are more extensive than
the stadium infrastructure requirements, the city may sell or otherwise dispose of the excess.
    Subd. 2. Claims. Except as may be mutually agreed to by the city and the authority, the city has
no interest in or claim to any assets or revenues of the authority.
    Subd. 3. Environmental; planning and zoning. The authority is the responsible governmental
unit for an environmental impact statement for the stadium prepared under section 116D.04, if an
environmental impact statement is necessary. Notwithstanding section 116D.04, subdivision 2b,
and implementing rules: (1) the environmental impact statement shall not be required to consider
alternative stadium sites; and (2) the environmental impact statement must be determined to be
adequate before commencing work on the foundation of the stadium, but the stadium and stadium
infrastructure may otherwise be started and all preliminary and final government decisions and
actions may be made and taken including, but not limited to, acquiring land; obtaining financing;
granting permits or other land use approvals; entering into grant, lease, or use agreements; or
preparing the site or related stadium infrastructure prior to a determination of the adequacy of the
environmental impact statement.
    Subd. 4. Local government expenditure. The city may make expenditures or grants for other
costs incidental and necessary to further the purposes of this chapter and may, by agreement,
reimburse in whole or in part, any entity that has granted, loaned, or advanced funds to the city to
further the purposes of this chapter. The city may reimburse the authority or a local governmental
entity or make a grant to the authority or such a governmental unit or be reimbursed by the authority
or local governmental entity for site acquisition, preparation of the site for stadium development,
and stadium infrastructure.
    Subd. 5. Municipal authority. The legislature intends that, except as expressly limited herein,
the city may acquire and develop stadium infrastructure, enter into contracts with the authority
and other governmental or nongovernmental entities, appropriate funds, and make employees,
consultants, and other revenues available for those purposes.
     Subd. 6. Stadium Implementation Committee; city review. In order to accomplish the
objectives of this act within the required time frame, it is necessary to establish an alternative
process for municipal land use and development review. It is hereby found and declared that
the construction of a stadium within the development area is consistent with the adopted area
plan, is the preferred stadium location, and is a permitted land use. This subdivision establishes a
procedure for all land use and development reviews and approvals by the city of Minneapolis for
the stadium and related stadium infrastructure and supersedes all land use and development rules
and restrictions and procedures imposed by other law, charter, or ordinance, including without
limitation section 15.99. No later than 30 days after timely compliance of the city as provided in
article 4, section 5, of this act, the city of Minneapolis shall establish a stadium implementation
committee to make recommendations on the design plans submitted for the stadium, and stadium
infrastructure, and related improvements. The implementation committee must take action to issue
its recommendations within the time frames established in the planning and construction timetable
issued by the authority which shall provide for no less than 60 days for the committee's review. The
recommendations of the implementation committee shall be forwarded to the city of Minneapolis
Planning Commission for an advisory recommendation and then to the city council for final action
7346                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [117TH DAY

in a single resolution, which final action must be taken within 45 days of the submission of the
recommendations to the planning commission. The city council shall not impose any unreasonable
conditions on the recommendations of the implementation committee, nor take any action or
impose any conditions that will result in delay from the time frames established in the planning
and construction timetable or in additional overall costs. Failure of the city council to act within
the 45-day period shall be deemed to be approval. The authority may seek de novo review in the
district court of any city council action. The district court or any appellate court shall expedite
review to the maximum extent possible and timely issue relief, orders, or opinions as necessary to
give effect to the provisions and objectives in this act.
   Sec. 17. [473J.19] PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION; SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
    Any real or personal property acquired, owned, leased, controlled, used, or occupied by the
authority for any of the purposes of this chapter, is acquired, owned, leased, controlled, used, and
occupied for public, governmental, and municipal purposes. The stadium and stadium infrastructure
are exempt from ad valorem taxation by the state or any political subdivision of the state provided
that the properties are subject to special assessments levied by a political subdivision for a local
improvement in amounts proportionate to and not exceeding the special benefit received by the
properties from the improvement. No possible use of any of the properties in any manner different
from their use under this chapter may be considered in determining the special benefit received by
the properties. Notwithstanding section 272.01, subdivision 2, or 273.19, real or personal property,
which is subject to a lease or use agreement between the authority and another person for uses related
to the purposes of this chapter, including the operation of the stadium and related parking facilities,
is exempt from taxation regardless of the length of the lease or use agreement or the characteristics
of the entity leasing or using the property. This section, insofar as it provides an exemption or special
treatment, does not apply to any real property that is leased for residential, business, or commercial
development or to a restaurant that is open for general business more than 200 days a year, or other
purposes different from those contemplated in this chapter.
   Sec. 18. [473J.23] LOCAL TAXES.
    No new or additional local sales or use tax shall be imposed on sales at the stadium site unless the
tax is applicable throughout the taxing jurisdiction. No new or additional local tax shall be imposed
on sales of tickets and admissions to NFL team, NFL team-owned major league soccer, or other
team related events at the stadium, notwithstanding any law or ordinance, unless the tax is applicable
throughout the taxing jurisdiction. The admissions and amusements tax currently imposed by the
city of Minneapolis pursuant to Laws 1969, chapter 1092, may apply to admissions for football and
NFL team related events, including NFL team-owned major league soccer, as provided in section
473J.15, subdivision 15, at the stadium.
   Sec. 19. [473J.25] METROPOLITAN SPORTS FACILITIES COMMISSION ASSETS;
LIABILITIES TO AUTHORITY.
    Subdivision 1. Authority expenses. The Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission shall pay
the operating expenses of the authority including salaries, compensation, and other personnel, office,
equipment, consultant and any other costs, until the commission is abolished pursuant to subdivision
3.
   Subd. 2. Transfer. Within 90 days of the enactment of this chapter, the Metropolitan Sports
Facilities Commission shall pay its outstanding obligations, settle its accounts, and transfer its
117TH DAY]                            TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2012                                      7347

remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations to the authority, for its purposes.
    Subd. 3. Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission abolished; interim powers conferred
on authority. Upon transfer to the authority of all remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations of
the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, in subdivision 2, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities
Commission is abolished. When the remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations of the Metropolitan
Sports Facilities Commission have been transferred to the authority and the commission has been
abolished, the powers and duties of the commission under sections 473.551 to 473.599, and any
other law shall devolve upon the authority, in addition to the powers and duties of the authority
under this chapter, until the first NFL home game is played at the stadium.
    Subd. 4. Employees. Upon transfer of ownership all persons employed by the Metropolitan
Sports Facilities Commission shall be transferred to the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority
without loss of right or privilege. Nothing in this section shall be construed to give any such person
the right or privilege to continue in the same level or classification of employment previously held.
The Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority may assign any such person to an employment level and
classification which it deems appropriate and desirable in accordance with its personnel code.
   Sec. 20. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Except as otherwise provided, this article is effective the day following final enactment.
                                             ARTICLE 2
                                   STATE STADIUM FUNDING

interest on revenue bonds.
    Subd. 2. Authorization to issue revenue bonds. (a) Subject to the limitations of this
subdivision, the commissioner may sell and issue revenue bonds of the state under this section for
public purposes as provided by law, including, in particular, the financing of all or a portion of the
acquisition, construction, improving, and equipping of the stadium project of the Minnesota Sports
Facilities Authority as provided by chapter 473J. Proceeds of the revenue bonds must be credited
to a special revenue stadium bond proceeds fund in the state treasury. Net income from investment
of the proceeds, as estimated by the commissioner, must be credited to the special revenue stadium
bond proceeds fund.
    (b) Revenue bonds may be sold and issued in amounts that, in the opinion of the commissioner,
are necessary to provide sufficient funds, not to exceed $598,000,000 net of costs of issuance,
deposits for debt service reserve funds, and costs of credit enhancement for achieving the purposes
authorized as provided under paragraph (a), and pay debt service, pay costs of issuance, make
deposits to reserve funds, pay the costs of credit enhancement, or make payments under other
agreements entered into under paragraph (d); provided, however, that revenue bonds issued and
unpaid shall not exceed $725,000,000 in principal amount, excluding refunding bonds sold and
issued under subdivision 4.
7348                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [117TH DAY

    (c) Revenue bonds may be issued from time to time in one or more series on the terms and
conditions the commissioner determines to be in the best interests of the state, but the term on any
series of revenue bonds may not exceed 30 years. The revenue bonds of each issue and series thereof
shall be dated and bear interest, and may be includable in or excludable from the gross income of
the owners for federal income tax purposes.
    (d) At the time of, or in anticipation of, issuing the revenue bonds, and at any time thereafter,

liquidity facilities, remarketing or dealer agreements, letter of credit agreements, insurance policies,
guaranty agreements, reimbursement agreements, indexing agreements, or interest exchange
agreements. Any payments made or received according to the agreement or ancillary arrangement
shall be made from or deposited as provided in the agreement or ancillary arrangement. The
determination of the commissioner included in an interest exchange agreement that the agreement
relates to an revenue bond shall be conclusive.
    (e) The commissioner may enter into written agreements or contracts relating to the continuing

    Subd. 5a. Equine industry improvement fund. (a) To compensate the horse racing industry for
the presence of lottery gaming machines at class A racing facilities, the commission shall establish
and maintain an equine industry improvement fund. Each licensee holding a location contract with
the lottery director shall, as directed by the commission, transmit an amount equal to 12 percent of
the location contract compensation received from the lottery director to the commission for deposit
into the equine industry improvement fund. Seventy-five percent of the funds shall be allocated

to use the funds to supplement purses offered for live races. Purse supplements required under this
subdivision are in addition to purse payments otherwise established by law or contract. The location
contract holder and the organization representing the majority of horsepersons racing at the location
contract holder's racetrack may, by written contract, agree to use a portion of the transferred funds
for racing-related purposes other than purse supplementation.

transmit that amount to the breeder's fund for the benefit of each breed racing at a class A licensed
facility hosting lottery gaming machines. Amounts transferred shall be in the same proportions
established, under this subdivision, for purse supplements. Amounts transferred to a breeder's fund
shall be used for the purposes of section 240.18, subdivisions 2, paragraph (d), and 3, paragraph (b),

commission, however, the licensee and the organization representing the majority of quarter horses
owners licensed to race in the state may agree to a different number of live races to be offered.
Scheduling of quarter horse races shall be as approved by the commission pursuant to section 240.03,

   (1) the city's 2010 population is less than 100 and its population growth between 2000 and 2010
was more than 55 percent; and
    (2) its commercial industrial percentage as defined in subdivision 32, based on assessments for
calendar year 2010, payable in 2011, is greater than 15 percent.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for aids payable in calendar year 2013 and
thereafter.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 477A.013, subdivision 9, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 9. City aid distribution. (a) In calendar year 2  ­0
                                                             ­­09

receive an aid distribution equal to the sum of (1) the city formula aid under subdivision 8, and (2)
its city aid base.
    (b) For aids payable in 2013 and 2014 only, the total aid in the previous year for any city shall
mean the amount of aid it was certified to receive for aids payable in 2012 under this section. For
aids payable in 2­0
                  ­­14
                     ­ 2015 and thereafter, the total aid in the previous year for any city means the

    (c) For aids payable in 2010 and thereafter, the total aid for any city shall not exceed the sum of
(1) ten percent of the city's net levy for the year prior to the aid distribution plus (2) its total aid in
the previous year. For aids payable in 2009 and thereafter, the total aid for any city with a population
of 2,500 or more may not be less than its total aid under this section in the previous year minus the
lesser of $10 multiplied by its population, or ten percent of its net levy in the year prior to the aid
distribution.

payable in 2009 only, the total aid for a city with a population less than 2,500 must not be less than
what it received under this section in the previous year unless its total aid in calendar year 2008 was
aid under section 477A.011, subdivision 36, paragraph (s), in which case its minimum aid is zero.
    (e) A city's aid loss under this section may not exceed $300,000 in any year in which the total city
aid appropriation under section 477A.03, subdivision 2a, is equal or greater than the appropriation
under that subdivision in the previous year, unless the city has an adjustment in its city net tax
capacity under the process described in section 469.174, subdivision 28.
    (f) If a city's net tax capacity used in calculating aid under this section has decreased in any year
by more than 25 percent from its net tax capacity in the previous year due to property becoming
tax-exempt Indian land, the city's maximum allowed aid increase under paragraph (c) shall be
increased by an amount equal to (1) the city's tax rate in the year of the aid calculation, multiplied
by (2) the amount of its net tax capacity decrease resulting from the property becoming tax exempt.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for aids payable in calendar year 2013 and
thereafter.
