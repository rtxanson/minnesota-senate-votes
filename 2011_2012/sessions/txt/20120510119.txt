   Sec. 9. [473J.01] PURPOSE.
    The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the construction, financing, and long-term use of
a stadium and related stadium infrastructure as a venue for professional football and a broad range
of other civic, community, athletic, educational, cultural, and commercial activities. The legislature
finds and declares that the expenditure of public money for this purpose is necessary and serves
a public purpose, and that property acquired by the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority for the
construction of the stadium and related stadium infrastructure is acquired for a public use or public
purpose under chapter 117. The legislature further finds and declares that any provision in a lease
or use agreement with a professional football team that requires the team to play all of its home
games in a publicly funded stadium for the duration of the lease or use agreement, serves a unique
public purpose for which the remedies of specific performance and injunctive relief are essential to
its enforcement. The legislature further finds and declares that government assistance to facilitate
the presence of professional football provides to the state of Minnesota and its citizens highly valued
intangible benefits that are virtually impossible to quantify and, therefore, not recoverable even if
the government receives monetary damages in the event of a team's breach of contract. Minnesota
courts are, therefore, charged with protecting those benefits through the use of specific performance
and injunctive relief as provided in this chapter and in the lease and use agreements.

manager certify, before the contract is signed, a guaranteed maximum construction price and
completion date to the authority and post a performance bond in an amount at least equal to 100

and members of minority communities when hiring. In addition, the authority shall contract with
an employment assistance firm, preferably minority-owned, or owned by a disabled individual or
a woman, to create an employment program to recruit, hire, and retain minorities for the stadium
facility. The authority shall hold a job fair and recruit and advertise at Minneapolis Urban League,
Sabathani, American Indian OIC, Youthbuild organizations, and other such organizations. Further,
goals for construction contracts to be awarded to women- and minority-owned businesses will be
in a percentage at least equal to the minimum used for city of Minneapolis development projects,
and the other construction workforce will establish workforce utilization goals at least equal to
current city goals and include workers from city zip codes that have high rates of poverty and
unemployment.
    Subd. 2. Other required agreements. The NFL team or the authority shall give food, beverage,
retail, and concession workers presently employed by the NFL team or the Metropolitan Sports
Facilities Commission or its vendors at the existing football stadium the opportunity to continue their
employment in comparable positions at the new stadium. Workers who are presently represented
under a collective bargaining agreement may seek to continue such representation in the facility
and designate such, or another collective bargaining unit, as their representative.
   Sec. 18. [473J.13] STADIUM OPERATIONS; CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Stadium operation. The stadium shall be operated in a first-class manner, similar
to and consistent with other comparable NFL stadiums. The authority and the team will mutually
agree on a third-party management company or individual to manage the stadium and on certain
major vendors to the stadium. The authority, with the approval of the NFL team, may enter into an
agreement with a program manager for management of the stadium, for a maximum of 30 years.
   Subd. 2. Operating expenses. (a) The authority must pay or cause to be paid all operating
expenses of the stadium. The authority must require in the lease or use agreement with the NFL
team that the NFL team pay the authority, beginning January 1, 2016, or other date as mutually
agreed upon by the parties, toward operating costs of the stadium, $8,500,000 each year, increased
by a three percent annual inflation rate.
    (b) Beginning January 1, 2016, or other date as mutually agreed upon by the parties, and
continuing through 2020, the state shall pay the authority operating expenses, $6,000,000 each
year, increased by an annual adjustment factor. The payment of $6,000,000 per year beginning in
2016 is a payment by the state, which shall be repaid to the state, using funds as provided under
section 297A.994, subdivision 4, clause (4). After 2020, the state shall assume this payment, using
funds generated in accordance with the city of Minneapolis as specified under section 297A.994,
subdivision 4, clause (3).
    (c) The authority may establish an operating reserve to cover operating expense shortfalls and
may accept funds from any source for deposit in the operating reserve. The establishment or funding
of an authority operating reserve must not decrease the amounts required to be paid to the authority
toward operating costs under this subdivision unless agreed to by the authority.
   (d) The authority will be responsible for operating cost overruns.
7610                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [119TH DAY

    (e) After the joint selection of the third-party manager or program manager, the authority
may agree with a program manager or other third-party manager of the stadium on a fixed cost
operating, management, or employment agreement with operating cost protections under which
the program manager or third-party manager assumes responsibility for stadium operating costs
and shortfalls. The agreement with the manager must require the manager to prepare an initial and
ongoing operating plan and operating budgets for approval by the authority in consultation with
the NFL team. The manager must agree to operate the stadium in accordance with the approved
operating plan and operating budget.
   Subd. 3. Public access. The authority will work to maximize access for public and amateur
sports, community, and civic events, and other public events in type and on terms consistent with
those currently held at the existing football stadium, as defined in section 473.551, subdivision 9.
The authority may provide that these events have exclusive use of the premises at agreed-upon times
subject to the scheduling rights of the NFL team under the lease or use agreement.
    Subd. 4. Capital improvements. (a) The authority shall establish a capital reserve fund.
The authority shall be responsible for making, or for causing others to make, all capital repairs,
replacements, and improvements for the stadium and stadium infrastructure. The authority shall
maintain, or cause others to maintain, the stadium and stadium infrastructure in a safe, clean,
attractive, and first-class manner so as to cause them to remain in a condition comparable to that
of other comparable NFL facilities of similar design and age. The authority shall make, or cause
others to make, all necessary or appropriate repairs, renewals, and replacements, whether structural
or nonstructural, interior or exterior, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen, in a prompt
and timely manner. In addition, the authority, with approval of the NFL team, may enter into an
agreement with a program manager to perform some or all of the responsibilities of the authority
in this subdivision and to assume and accept financial liability for the cost of performing the
responsibilities.
    (b) The NFL team must contribute $1,500,000 each year, beginning in 2016 or as otherwise
determined for the term of the lease or use agreement to the capital reserve fund, increased by a
three percent annual inflation rate.
    (c) The state shall contribute $1,500,000 each year, beginning in 2016 or as otherwise determined
for the term of the lease to the capital reserve fund. The contributions of the state are subject to
increase by an annual adjustment factor. The contribution under this paragraph by the state from
2016 through 2020 shall be repaid to the state using funds in accordance with section 297A.994,
subdivision 4, clause (4).
    (d) The authority with input from the NFL team shall develop short-term and long-term capital
funding plans and shall use those plans to guide the future capital needs of the stadium and stadium
infrastructure. The authority shall make the final determination with respect to funding capital
needs. Any capital improvement proposed by the NFL team intended primarily to provide revenue
enhancements to the NFL team shall be paid for by the NFL team, unless otherwise agreed to with
the authority.
    (e) The NFL team has authority to determine the design of a retractable roof feature for the
stadium. The NFL team must cooperate with the authority in designing the feature to minimize any
additional operating cost. The design must not result in a material marginal increase in the operating
or capital costs of the stadium, considering current collections and reserves.
119TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MAY 10, 2012                                       7611

    Subd. 5. Game-day payments. In addition to operating expense contributions of the NFL
team under subdivision 2, the NFL team shall pay all NFL game day, NFL team-owned major
league soccer, as provided in section 473J.15, subdivision 15, and other NFL team-sponsored event
expenses within the stadium and stadium plaza areas.
    Subd. 6. Cooperation with financing. The authority shall cooperate with the NFL team to
facilitate the financing of the NFL team's contribution. Such agreement to cooperate shall not require
the authority to incur any additional costs or provide conduit financing. The lease, license, and
other transaction documents shall include provisions customarily required by lenders in stadium
financings.
   Sec. 19. [473J.15] CRITERIA AND CONDITIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Binding and enforceable. In developing the stadium and entering into related
contracts, the authority must follow and enforce the criteria and conditions in this section, provided
that a determination by the authority that those criteria or conditions have been met under any
agreement or otherwise shall be conclusive.
    Subd. 2. NFL team/private contribution; timing of expenditures. (a) The NFL team/private
contribution, including stadium builder license proceeds, for stadium costs must be made in cash in
the amount of at least $477,000,000.
    (b) Prior to the initial deposit of funds under this section, the team must provide security or
other credit worthiness in the amount of $50,000,000, subject to the satisfaction of the authority.
Prior to the first issuance of bonds under section 16A.965, the first portion of the NFL team/private
contribution in the amount of $50,000,000 must be deposited as costs are incurred to the construction
fund to pay for the initial stadium costs.
    (c) After the first $50,000,000 of stadium costs have been paid from the initial NFL team/private
contribution, state funds shall be deposited as costs are incurred to the construction fund to pay
for the next $50,000,000 of costs of the project. Prior to any state funds being deposited in the
construction fund, the NFL team must provide security or a financing commitment reasonably
satisfactory to the authority for the balance of the required NFL team/private contribution and for
payment of cost overruns if the NFL team assumes responsibility for stadium construction under
section 473J.11. Thereafter, budgeted project costs shall be borne by the authority and the NFL
team/private contributions in amounts proportionate to their remaining funding commitments.
   (d) In the event the project terminates before the initial $100,000,000 in contributions are
expended by the parties under this subdivision, the parties shall be reimbursed in the amounts
they have deposited to the construction fund proportionate to project funding percentages, in the
amounts of 51 percent by the authority and 49 percent by the NFL team/private contributions.
    Subd. 3. Lease or use agreements; 30-year term. The authority must enter into a long-term
lease or use agreement with the NFL team for the NFL team's use of the stadium. The NFL team must
agree to play all preseason, regular season, and postseason home games at the stadium. However,
the team may play up to three home games outside of the United States during the first 15 years of
the lease or use agreement and up to three home games outside of the United States in the next 15
years of the lease or use agreement. Training facilities must remain in Minnesota during the term of
the lease or use agreement. The lease or use agreement must be for a term of at least 30 years from
the date of substantial completion of the stadium for professional football games. The lease or use
7612                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [119TH DAY

agreement may provide options for the NFL team to extend the term for up to four additional periods
of five years. The lease or use agreement must include terms for default, termination, and breach
of the agreement. Recognizing that the presence of professional football provides to the state of
Minnesota and its citizens highly valued, intangible benefits that are virtually impossible to quantify
and, therefore, not recoverable in the event of the NFL team owner's breach of contract, the lease
and use agreements must provide for specific performance and injunctive relief to enforce provisions
relating to use of the stadium for professional football and must not include escape clauses or buyout
provisions. The NFL team must not enter into or accept any agreement or requirement with or from
any entity that is inconsistent with the NFL team's binding commitment to the 30-year term of the
lease or use agreement or that would in any manner dilute, interfere with, or negate the provisions of
the lease or use agreement, providing for specific performance or injunctive relief. The legislature
conclusively determines, as a matter of public policy, that the lease or use agreement, and any grant
agreement under this chapter that includes a specific performance clause:
   (1) explicitly authorizes specific performance as a remedy for breach;
   (2) is made for adequate consideration and upon terms which are otherwise fair and reasonable;
   (3) has not been included through sharp practice, misrepresentation, or mistake;
    (4) if specifically enforced, does not cause unreasonable or disproportionate hardship or loss to
the NFL team or to third parties; and
    (5) involves performance in a manner and the rendering of services of a nature and under
circumstances that the beneficiary cannot be adequately compensated in damages.
    Subd. 4. Lease or use agreements; revenues, payments. A lease or use agreement shall include
rent and other fees and expenses to be paid by the NFL team. The authority shall agree to provide
in the lease or use agreement for the NFL team to receive all NFL and team event related revenues,
including but not limited to, suite revenues, advertising, concessions, signage, broadcast and media,
and club seat revenue. The agreement shall also provide that all naming rights to the stadium are
retained by the NFL team, subject to the approval of the name or names by the authority consistent
with those criteria set out in the lease or use agreement. The agreement shall provide for the authority
to receive all general ticket revenues and other event revenues other than from NFL team games,
NFL team-owned major league soccer games, and other NFL team events agreed to by the authority.
    Subd. 5. Notice of breach or default. Until 30 years from the date of stadium completion, the
NFL team must provide written notice to the authority not less than 180 days prior to any action,
including any action imposed upon the NFL team by the NFL, which would result in a breach or
default of provisions of the lease or use agreements required to be included under subdivision 3. If
this notice provision is violated and the NFL team has already breached or been in default under the
required provisions, the authority or the state of Minnesota may specifically enforce the lease or use
agreement and Minnesota courts shall fashion equitable remedies so that the NFL team fulfills the
conditions of the lease and use agreements.
   Subd. 6. Enforceable financial commitments. The authority must determine before stadium
construction begins that all public and private funding sources for construction, operating expenses,
and capital improvements and repairs of the stadium are included in written agreements. The
committed funds must be adequate to design, construct, furnish, and equip the stadium, and pay
projected operating expenses and the costs of capital improvements and repairs during the term
119TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MAY 10, 2012                                        7613

of the lease or use agreement with the NFL team. The NFL team must provide the authority
access to NFL team financial or other information, which the authority deems necessary for
such determination. Any financial information obtained by the authority under this subdivision is
nonpublic data under section 13.02, subdivision 9.
   Subd. 7. Environmental requirements. The authority must comply with all environmental
requirements imposed by regulatory agencies for the stadium, site, and structure, except as provided
by section 473J.09, subdivision 11, or by section 473J.17.
    Subd. 8. Public share on sale of NFL team. (a) The lease or use agreement must provide that if
the NFL team is sold, or an interest in the NFL team is sold after the effective date of this section, a
portion of the sale price, determined according to the schedule in paragraph (b), is the public share
and must be paid to the state and the city, in amounts proportionate to the expenditures made by the
state and from city taxes, respectively, for the purposes of this chapter. If any portion of the public
share of the sale price remains after the state and city have been paid, that amount must be deposited
in the general fund.
   (b) The portion of the sale price required to be paid under paragraph (a) is:
  (1) 25 percent of the amount in excess of the purchase price of the NFL team by the selling
owner or owners for ten years, beginning on the effective date of this section;
   (2) 15 percent during years 11 to 15 after the effective date of this section; and
   (3) ten percent during years 16 to 20 after the effective date of this section.
   Thereafter, no portion of the sale price is required to be paid under paragraph (a).
    (c) The agreement must provide exceptions for sales to members of the owners' families and
entities and trusts beneficially owned by family members, sales to employees of equity interests
aggregating up to ten percent, sales related to capital infusions not distributed to the owners, and
sales among existing owners not exceeding 20 percent equity interest in the NFL team.
    Subd. 9. Authority's access to NFL team financial information. A notice provision for a
material breach shall be agreed to between the authority and the NFL team. In the event there is a
material breach by the NFL team under the lease or use agreement, the lease or use agreement must
provide the authority access to audited financial statements of the NFL team and other financial
information that the authority deems necessary to enforce the terms of any lease or use agreements.
Any financial information obtained by the authority under this subdivision is nonpublic data under
section 13.02, subdivision 9.
    Subd. 10. NFL team name retained. The lease or use agreement must provide that the NFL
shall retain the Minnesota Vikings' heritage and records, including the name, logo, colors, history,
playing records, trophies, and memorabilia in the event of relocation of the NFL team in violation
of the lease or use agreement, and shall not permit use of these rights except for a team located in
the state of Minnesota.
    Subd. 11. Stadium design. (a) To the extent practicable, the authority and the NFL team will
build a stadium that is environmentally and energy efficient and will make an effort to build a stadium
that is eligible to receive the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification
or the Green Building Initiative Green Globes certification for environmental design, and to the
7614                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [119TH DAY

extent practicable, will strive to make the stadium design architecturally significant.
    (b) To the extent practicable, the stadium design must, to the extent that the costs of following
the guidelines have a payback in energy savings in 30 years or less, follow sustainable building
guidelines established under section 16B.325. The authority and NFL team must work with local
utility companies to establish a base utility cost under the state energy codes and calculate energy
cost savings resulting from complying with the guidelines. The authority and NFL team must fully
utilize conservation improvement assistance under section 216B.241 and other energy savings
programs available to them.
   (c) To the extent practicable, the authority and the team must ensure that the stadium be built
with American-made steel that is made from Minnesota iron ore.
    Subd. 12. Necessary approvals. The authority and the NFL team must secure any necessary
approvals to the terms of the lease and use agreement and the design and construction plans for the
stadium, including prior approval of the NFL.
   Subd. 13. Affordable access. The lease or use agreement must provide for an agreed-upon
number of affordable tickets to the professional sporting events held in the stadium.
    Subd. 14. Stadium builder's licenses. The authority shall own and retain the exclusive right to
sell stadium builder's licenses in the stadium. The authority will retain the NFL team to act as the
authority's agent in marketing and selling such licenses.
    Subd. 15. Major league soccer. The authority shall, for five years after the first NFL team home
game is played in the stadium, grant the NFL team the exclusive right to establish major league
soccer at the stadium. The authority and the NFL team may enter into an agreement providing the
terms and conditions of such an arrangement, provided:
    (1) if any of the NFL team owners whose family owns at least three percent of the NFL team
purchases full or partial ownership in a major league soccer franchise, such franchise may play in
the stadium under a use agreement with similar terms as are applicable to the NFL team which shall
include rent based on market conditions but not less than a provision of payment of game-day costs
and reasonable marginal costs incurred by the authority as a result of the major league soccer team;
and
  (2) capital improvements required by a major league soccer franchise must be financed by the
owners of the major league soccer team, unless otherwise agreed to by the authority.
    Subd. 16. NFL team-related entities. Subject to the prior approval of the authority, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, any of the obligations by the NFL team may be performed by the NFL
team, a related entity, or a third party, and the NFL team, any entity related to the NFL team or third
party may receive any revenues to which the NFL team is entitled hereunder; provided, however,
the NFL team shall remain liable if any obligations are assigned to a related entity or third party.
   Sec. 20. [473J.17] MUNICIPAL ACTIVITIES.
    Subdivision 1. Property acquisition and disposition. The city may, to the extent legally
permissible, acquire land, air rights, and other property interests within the development area
for the stadium site and stadium infrastructure and convey it to the authority with or without
consideration, prepare a site for development as a stadium, and acquire and construct any related
119TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MAY 10, 2012                                      7615

stadium infrastructure. To the extent property parcels or interests acquired are more extensive than
the stadium infrastructure requirements, the city may sell or otherwise dispose of the excess.
    Subd. 2. Claims. Except as may be mutually agreed to by the city and the authority, the city has
no interest in or claim to any assets or revenues of the authority.
    Subd. 3. Environmental; planning and zoning. The authority is the responsible governmental
unit for an environmental impact statement for the stadium prepared under section 116D.04, if an
environmental impact statement is necessary. Notwithstanding section 116D.04, subdivision 2b,
and implementing rules: (1) the environmental impact statement shall not be required to consider
alternative stadium sites; and (2) the environmental impact statement must be determined to be
adequate before commencing work on the foundation of the stadium, but the stadium and stadium
infrastructure may otherwise be started and all preliminary and final government decisions and
actions may be made and taken including, but not limited to, acquiring land; obtaining financing;
granting permits or other land use approvals; entering into grant, lease, or use agreements; or
preparing the site or related stadium infrastructure prior to a determination of the adequacy of the
environmental impact statement.
    Subd. 4. Local government expenditure. The city may make expenditures or grants for other
costs incidental and necessary to further the purposes of this chapter and may, by agreement,
reimburse in whole or in part, any entity that has granted, loaned, or advanced funds to the city to
further the purposes of this chapter. The city may reimburse the authority or a local governmental
entity or make a grant to the authority or such a governmental unit or be reimbursed by the authority
or local governmental entity for site acquisition, preparation of the site for stadium development,
and stadium infrastructure.
    Subd. 5. Municipal authority. The legislature intends that, except as expressly limited herein,
the city may acquire and develop stadium infrastructure, enter into contracts with the authority
and other governmental or nongovernmental entities, appropriate funds, and make employees,
consultants, and other revenues available for those purposes.
     Subd. 6. Stadium Implementation Committee; city review. In order to accomplish the
objectives of this act within the required time frame, it is necessary to establish an alternative
process for municipal land use and development review. It is hereby found and declared that
the construction of a stadium within the development area is consistent with the adopted area
plan, is the preferred stadium location, and is a permitted land use. This subdivision establishes a
procedure for all land use and development reviews and approvals by the city of Minneapolis for
the stadium and related stadium infrastructure and supersedes all land use and development rules
and restrictions and procedures imposed by other law, charter, or ordinance, including without
limitation section 15.99. No later than 30 days after timely compliance of the city as provided in
article 3, section 7, of this act, the city of Minneapolis shall establish a stadium implementation
committee to make recommendations on the design plans submitted for the stadium, and stadium
infrastructure, and related improvements. The implementation committee must take action to issue
its recommendations within the time frames established in the planning and construction timetable
issued by the authority which shall provide for no less than 60 days for the committee's review. The
recommendations of the implementation committee shall be forwarded to the city of Minneapolis
Planning Commission for an advisory recommendation and then to the city council for final action
in a single resolution, which final action must be taken within 45 days of the submission of the
recommendations to the planning commission. The city council shall not impose any unreasonable
7616                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [119TH DAY

conditions on the recommendations of the implementation committee, nor take any action or
impose any conditions that will result in delay from the time frames established in the planning
and construction timetable or in additional overall costs. Failure of the city council to act within
the 45-day period shall be deemed to be approval. The authority may seek de novo review in the
district court of any city council action. The district court or any appellate court shall expedite
review to the maximum extent possible and timely issue relief, orders, or opinions as necessary to
give effect to the provisions and objectives in this act.
   Sec. 21. [473J.19] PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION; SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
    Any real or personal property acquired, owned, leased, controlled, used, or occupied by the
authority for any of the purposes of this chapter, is acquired, owned, leased, controlled, used, and
occupied for public, governmental, and municipal purposes. The stadium and stadium infrastructure
are exempt from ad valorem taxation by the state or any political subdivision of the state provided
that the properties are subject to special assessments levied by a political subdivision for a local
improvement in amounts proportionate to and not exceeding the special benefit received by the
properties from the improvement. No possible use of any of the properties in any manner different
from their use under this chapter may be considered in determining the special benefit received by
the properties. Notwithstanding section 272.01, subdivision 2, or 273.19, real or personal property
which is subject to a lease or use agreement between the authority and another person for uses related
to the purposes of this chapter, including the operation of the stadium and related parking facilities,
is exempt from taxation regardless of the length of the lease or use agreement or the characteristics
of the entity leasing or using the property. This section, insofar as it provides an exemption or special
treatment, does not apply to any real property that is leased for residential, business, or commercial
development or to a restaurant that is open for general business more than 200 days a year, or other
purposes different from those contemplated in this chapter.
   Sec. 22. [473J.21] LIQUOR LICENSES.
   At the request of the authority, the city may issue intoxicating liquor licenses that are reasonably
required for the premises of the stadium site. These licenses are in addition to the number authorized
by law. All provisions of chapter 340A not inconsistent with this section apply to the licenses
authorized under this section.
   Sec. 23. [473J.23] LOCAL TAXES.
    No new or additional local sales or use tax shall be imposed on sales at the stadium site
unless the tax is applicable throughout the taxing jurisdiction. Except for a tax imposed under
section 16A.1524, no new or additional local tax shall be imposed on sales of tickets and
admissions to NFL team, NFL team-owned major league soccer, or other team related events at the
stadium, notwithstanding any law or ordinance, unless the tax is applicable throughout the taxing
jurisdiction. The admissions and amusements tax currently imposed by the city of Minneapolis
pursuant to Laws 1969, chapter 1092, may apply to admissions for football and NFL team
related events, including NFL team-owned major league soccer, as provided in section 473J.15,
subdivision 15, at the stadium.
   Sec. 24. [473J.25] METROPOLITAN SPORTS FACILITIES COMMISSION ASSETS;
LIABILITIES TO AUTHORITY.
   Subdivision 1. Authority expenses. The Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission shall pay
119TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MAY 10, 2012                                       7617

the operating expenses of the authority including salaries, compensation, and other personnel, office,
equipment, consultant and any other costs, until the commission is abolished pursuant to subdivision
3.

    Subd. 3. Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission abolished; interim powers conferred
on authority. Upon transfer to the authority of all remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations of
the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, in subdivision 2, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities
Commission is abolished. When the remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations of the Metropolitan
Sports Facilities Commission have been transferred to the authority and the commission has been
abolished, the powers and duties of the commission under sections 473.551 to 473.599, and any
other law shall devolve upon the authority, in addition to the powers and duties of the authority
under chapter 473J, until the first NFL home game is played at the stadium.
    Subd. 4. Employees. Upon transfer of ownership all persons employed by the Metropolitan
Sports Facilities Commission shall be transferred to the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority
without loss of right or privilege. Nothing in this section shall be construed to give any such person
the right or privilege to continue in the same level or classification of employment previously held.
The Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority may assign any such person to an employment level and
classification which it deems appropriate and desirable in accordance with its personnel code.
    Subd. 5. Conforming changes. The Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission shall submit a
technical bill to the 2013 legislature making any cross-reference, grammatical, or other conforming
changes necessary as a result of this act. This bill shall be submitted by February 12, 2013.

    (c) Appropriation bonds may be issued from time to time in one or more series on the terms and

or other similar instruments, and in the manner provided in section 16A.672. In the event that any
provision of section 16A.672 conflicts with this section, this section shall control.
    (b) Every appropriation bond shall include a conspicuous statement of the limitation established

   (e) Notwithstanding any other law, appropriation bonds issued under this section shall be fully

    Subd. 4. Refunding bonds. The commissioner from time to time may issue appropriation bonds
for the purpose of refunding any appropriation bonds then outstanding, including the payment of
any redemption premiums on the bonds, any interest accrued or to accrue to the redemption date,
and costs related to the issuance and sale of the refunding bonds. The proceeds of any refunding
bonds may, in the discretion of the commissioner, be applied to the purchase or payment at maturity
of the appropriation bonds to be refunded, to the redemption of the outstanding appropriation bonds
on any redemption date, or to pay interest on the refunding bonds and may, pending application, be
placed in escrow to be applied to the purchase, payment, retirement, or redemption. Any escrowed
proceeds, pending such use, may be invested and reinvested in obligations that are authorized
investments under section 11A.24. The income earned or realized on the investment may also be
applied to the payment of the appropriation bonds to be refunded or interest or premiums on the
refunded appropriation bonds, or to pay interest on the refunding bonds. After the terms of the
escrow have been fully satisfied, any balance of the proceeds and any investment income may be
returned to the general fund or, if applicable, the special appropriation stadium bond proceeds fund
for use in any lawful manner. All refunding bonds issued under this subdivision must be prepared,
executed, delivered, and secured by appropriations in the same manner as the appropriation bonds
to be refunded.

invest any sinking funds, money, or other funds belonging to them or under their control in any
appropriation bonds issued under this section:

and public bodies;

banks and institutions, investment companies, insurance companies, insurance associations, and
other persons carrying on a banking or insurance business; and
   (3) personal representatives, guardians, trustees, and other fiduciaries.
    Subd. 6. No full faith and credit; state not required to make appropriations. The
appropriation bonds are not public debt of the state, and the full faith, credit, and taxing powers of
the state are not pledged to the payment of the appropriation bonds or to any payment that the state
agrees to make under this section. Appropriation bonds shall not be obligations paid directly, in
7620                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [119TH DAY

whole or in part, from a tax of statewide application on any class of property, income, transaction,
or privilege. Appropriation bonds shall be payable in each fiscal year only from amounts that the
legislature may appropriate for debt service for any fiscal year, provided that nothing in this section
shall be construed to require the state to appropriate funds sufficient to make debt service payments
with respect to the appropriation bonds in any fiscal year. Appropriation bonds shall be canceled
and shall no longer be outstanding on the earlier of (1) the first day of a fiscal year for which the
legislature shall not have appropriated amounts sufficient for debt service, or (2) the date of final

of the state, and for the operating and capital reserves of the authority, each as permitted by state

bonds, and such proceeds may be granted, loaned, or otherwise provided to the authority for the
public purpose provided by subdivision 2, paragraph (a).
    Subd. 8. Appropriation for debt service and other purposes. The amount needed to pay
principal and interest on appropriation bonds issued under this section is appropriated each fiscal
year from the general fund to the commissioner, subject to repeal, unallotment under section
16A.152, or cancellation, otherwise pursuant to subdivision 6, for deposit into the bond payments
account established for such purpose in the special appropriation stadium bond proceeds fund.
   Subd. 9. Waiver of immunity. The waiver of immunity by the state provided for by section
3.751, subdivision 1, shall be applicable to the appropriation bonds and any ancillary contracts to
which the commissioner is a party.
    Subd. 10. Validation. (a) Appropriation bonds issued under this section may be validated in the
manner provided by this subdivision. If comparable appropriation bonds are judicially determined
to be valid, nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to prevent the sale or delivery of any
appropriation bonds or notes without entry of a judgment of validation by the Minnesota Supreme
Court pursuant to this subdivision with respect to the appropriation bonds authorized under this
section.
  (b) Any appropriation bonds issued under this section that are validated shall be validated in the
manner provided by this subdivision.

proceeding authorizing the issue and its adoption, all other essential proceedings had or taken in
connection with issuing bonds, the amount of the appropriation bonds to be issued and the maximum
interest they are to bear, and all other pertinent matters.
    (g) The Minnesota Supreme Court shall issue an order directed against the state and taxpayers,
citizens, and others having or claiming any right, title, or interest affected by the issuance of
appropriation bonds, or to be affected by the bonds, allowing all persons, in general terms and
without naming them, and the state through its attorney general, to appear before the Minnesota
Supreme Court at a designated time and place and show why the complaint should not be granted
and the proceedings and appropriation bonds validated. A copy of the complaint and order shall
be served on the attorney general at least 20 days before the time fixed for hearing. The attorney
general shall examine the complaint, and, if it appears or there is reason to believe that it is
defective, insufficient, or untrue, or if in the opinion of the attorney general the issuance of the
appropriation bonds in question has not been duly authorized, defense shall be made by the attorney
general as the attorney general deems appropriate.
    (h) Before the date set for hearing, as directed by the Minnesota Supreme Court, either the clerk
of the Minnesota appellate courts or the commissioner shall publish a copy of the order in a legal
newspaper of general circulation in Ramsey County and the state, at least once each week for two
consecutive weeks, commencing with the first publication, which shall not be less than 20 days
before the date set for hearing. By this publication, all taxpayers, citizens, and others having or
claiming any right, title, or interest in the state, are made parties defendant to the action and the
Minnesota Supreme Court has jurisdiction of them to the same extent as if named as defendants in
the complaint and personally served with process.
    (i) Any taxpayer, citizen, or person interested may become a party to the action by moving
against or pleading to the complaint at or before the time set for hearing. The Minnesota Supreme
Court shall determine all questions of law and fact and make orders that will enable it to properly
try and determine the action and render a final judgment within 30 days of the hearing with the least
possible delay.
     (j) If the judgment validates appropriation bonds, the judgment is forever conclusive as to all
matters adjudicated and as against all parties affected and all others having or claiming any right,
title, or interest affected by the issuance of appropriation bonds, or to be affected in any way by
issuing the bonds, and the validity of appropriation bonds or of any revenues pledged for the payment
of the bonds, or of the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds, including any remedies
provided for their collection, shall never be called in question in any court by any person or party.
    (k)(1) Appropriation bonds, when validated under this section, shall have stamped or written on
the bonds, by the proper officers of the state issuing them, a statement in substantially the following
form: "This appropriation bond is one of a series of appropriation bonds which were validated by
judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota, rendered on ....... , ....... (year)".
    (2) A certified copy of the judgment or decree shall be received as evidence in any court in this
state.
    (l) The costs shall be paid by the state, except when a taxpayer, citizen, or other person contests
the action or intervenes, the court may tax the whole or any part of the costs against the person that
is equitable.

    (m) A justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court is not disqualified in any validation action because
the justice is a landowner or taxpayer of the state.

  Section 1. [297A.994] CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS SALES TAX; ALLOCATION OF
REVENUES.
   Subdivision 1. Scope. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 297A.99, subdivision 11, the
provisions of this section govern the remittance of the proceeds of taxes imposed by the city of
Minneapolis under the special law.
   Subd. 2. Definitions. (a) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply.
   (b) "City" means the city of Minneapolis.
   (c) "Special law" means Laws 1986, chapter 396, sections 4 and 5, as amended.
   (d) "Tax" means the sales taxes imposed by the city under the special law.
   (e) The terms defined under section 473J.03 apply for purposes of this section.
    Subd. 3. General allocation of revenues. The commissioner shall remit the revenues from the
taxes, less the deductions listed in this subdivision, to the city at least quarterly. The commissioner
shall make the following deductions in the order listed before distribution to the city:
   (1) refunds of any of these taxes due to taxpayers, if any;
   (2) the direct and indirect costs of the department to administer, audit, and collect the tax,
according to the applicable law and agreements between the commissioner and the city. For
revenues from the general local sales and use tax, the commissioner must deduct a proportionate
share of costs described in section 297A.99, subdivision 11; and
   (3) notwithstanding the provisions of any agreement between the commissioner and the city
providing for collection and remittance of these taxes, the commissioner must deposit to the general
fund the amounts specified in subdivision 4.
   Subd. 4. General fund allocations. The commissioner must retain and deposit to the general
fund the following amounts, as required by subdivision 3, clause (3):
    (1) for state bond debt service support beginning in calendar year 2021, and for each calendar
year thereafter through calendar year 2046, periodic amounts so that not later than December
31, 2046, an aggregate amount equal to a present value of $150,000,000 has been deposited in
the general fund. To determine aggregate present value, the commissioner must consult with the

rates, and schedule of annual amounts. The present value dates must be based on the dates state funds
are paid to the authority, or the dates the commissioner of revenue deposits taxes for purposes of this
clause to the general fund. The discount rates must be based on the reasonably equivalent cost of
state funds as determined by the commissioner of management and budget. The schedule of annual
amounts must be revised to reflect amounts paid under section 473J.13, subdivision 2, paragraph
(b) for 2016 to 2020, and subdivision 4, paragraph (c) for 2016 to 2020, and taxes deposited to
the general fund from time to time under this clause, and the schedule and revised schedules must

previous year exceeds the sum of the net actual taxes in calendar year 2011 plus $1,000,000, inflated
at two percent per year since 2011, minus
    (ii) 25 percent of the difference, if any, by which the amount of the net annual taxes for the

Statutes, chapter 297A that occur within the city, and may also by ordinance impose an additional

   Sec. 11. [297E.021] SPECIAL ALLOCATION OF REVENUES.
   Subdivision 1. Application; revenues not pledged. The provisions of this subdivision apply
only after the issuance of appropriation bonds under section 16A.965, subdivision 2, but do not
constitute a pledge of available revenues as security for payment of principal and interest on
appropriation bonds issued under section 16A.965.
    Subd. 2. Determination of revenue increase. By March 15 of each fiscal year, the commissioner
of management and budget, in consultation with the commissioner, shall determine the estimated
increase in revenues received from taxes imposed under this chapter over the estimated revenues
under the February 2012 state budget forecast for that fiscal year. For fiscal years after fiscal year
2015, the commissioner of management and budget shall use the February 2012 state budget forecast
for fiscal year 2015 as the baseline. All calculations under this subdivision must be made net of
estimated refunds of the taxes required to be paid.
  Subd. 3. Available revenues. For purposes of this section, "available revenues" equals the
amount determined under subdivision 2:
   (1) reduced by the following amounts paid for the fiscal year under:
   (i) the appropriation to principal and interest on appropriation bonds under section 16A.965,
subdivision 8;
   (ii) the appropriation from the general fund to make operating expense payments under section
473J.13, subdivision 2, paragraph (b);
   (iii) the appropriation for contributions to the capital reserve fund under section 473J.13,
subdivision 4, paragraph (c);

   (v) the reduction in revenues resulting from the sales tax exemptions under section 297A.71,

(c), and any successor appropriation; and

    (2) increased by the revenue deposited in the general fund under section 297A.994, subdivision
4, clauses (1) to (3), for the fiscal year.
    Subd. 4. Appropriation; general reserve account. To the extent the commissioner determines
that revenues are available under subdivision 3 for the fiscal year, those amounts are appropriated
from the general fund for deposit in a general reserve account established by order of the
commissioner of management and budget. Amounts in this reserve are appropriated as necessary
for application against any shortfall in the amounts deposited to the general fund under section
297A.994 or, after consultation with the legislative commission on planning and fiscal policy,
amounts in this reserve are appropriated to the commissioner of management and budget for other
uses related to the stadium authorized under section 473J.03, subdivision 7, that the commissioner
deems financially prudent including but not limited to reimbursements for capital and operating
costs relating to the stadium, refundings, and prepayment of debt. In no event, shall available
revenues be pledged, nor shall the appropriations of available revenues made by this section
constitute a pledge of available revenues as security for the prepayment of principal and interest on
the appropriation bonds under section 16A.965.

   Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.162, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Sales from facilities. (a) All gambling equipment purchased or possessed by a licensed

resale or lease, be unloaded into a storage facility located in Minnesota which the distributor owns
or leases; and which has been registered, in advance and in writing, with the Division of Alcohol and
Gambling Enforcement as a storage facility of the distributor. All unregistered gambling equipment
and all unaffixed registration stamps owned by, or in the possession of, a licensed distributor in the
state of Minnesota shall be stored at a storage facility which has been registered with the Division of
Alcohol and Gambling Enforcement. No gambling equipment may be moved from the facility unless
the gambling equipment has been first registered with the board or the Department of Revenue. A
distributor must notify the board of the method that it will use to sell and transfer electronic pull-tab
games to licensed organizations, and must receive approval of the board before implementing or
making changes to the approved method.
    (b) Notwithstanding section 349.163, subdivisions 5, 6, and 8, a licensed manufacturer may
ship into Minnesota approved or unapproved gambling equipment if the licensed manufacturer
ships the gambling equipment to a Minnesota storage facility that is: (1) owned or leased by the
licensed manufacturer; and (2) registered, in advance and in writing, with the Division of Alcohol
and Gambling Enforcement as a manufacturer's storage facility. No gambling equipment may be
shipped into Minnesota to the manufacturer's registered storage facility unless the shipment of

department. No gambling equipment may be moved from the storage facility unless the gambling
equipment is sold to a licensed distributor and is otherwise in conformity with this chapter, is
shipped to an out-of-state site and the shipment is reported to the Department of Revenue in a
manner prescribed by the department, or is otherwise sold and shipped as permitted by board
rule. A manufacturer must notify the board of the method that it will use to sell and transfer
7646                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [119TH DAY

electronic pull-tab games to licensed distributors, and must receive approval of the board before
implementing or making changes to the approved method.
    (c) All storage facilities owned, leased, used, or operated by a licensed distributor or
manufacturer may be entered upon and inspected by the employees of the Division of Alcohol and
Gambling Enforcement, the Division of Alcohol and Gambling Enforcement director's authorized
representatives, employees of the Gambling Control Board or its authorized representatives,
employees of the Department of Revenue, or authorized representatives of the director of the
Division of Special Taxes of the Department of Revenue during reasonable and regular business
hours. Obstruction of, or failure to permit, entry and inspection is cause for revocation or suspension

manufacturing plant of a licensed manufacturer or a registered storage facility are contraband under

shipping document; and
    (2) to gambling equipment registered with the Department of Revenue for distribution to the
tribal casinos.
   Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.163, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. License required. No manufacturer of gambling equipment may sell any
gambling equipment to any person for use or resale within the state, unless the manufacturer has
a current and valid license issued by the board under this section and has satisfied other criteria
prescribed by the board by rule. A manufacturer licensed under this section may also be licensed
as a linked bingo game provider under section 349.1635.
    A manufacturer licensed under this section may not also be directly or indirectly licensed as a
distributor under section 349.161.
   Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.163, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Paper pull-tab and tipboard flares. (a) A manufacturer may not ship or cause to be
shipped into this state or sell for use or resale in this state any deal of paper pull-tabs or tipboards
that does not have its own individual flare as required for that deal by this subdivision and rule of the
board. A person other than a manufacturer may not manufacture, alter, modify, or otherwise change
a flare for a deal of paper pull-tabs or tipboards except as allowed by this chapter or board rules.
    (b) The flare of each paper pull-tab and tipboard game must have affixed to or imprinted at the
bottom a bar code that provides all information required by the commissioner of revenue under
section 297E.04, subdivision 2.
    The serial number included in the bar code must be the same as the serial number of the tickets
included in the deal. A manufacturer who manufactures a deal of paper pull-tabs must affix to the
outside of the box containing that game the same bar code that is affixed to or imprinted at the
bottom of a flare for that deal.
119TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MAY 10, 2012                                          7647

    (c) No person may alter the bar code that appears on the outside of a box containing a deal of
paper pull-tabs and tipboards. Possession of a box containing a deal of paper pull-tabs and tipboards
that has a bar code different from the bar code of the deal inside the box is prima facie evidence that
the possessor has altered the bar code on the box.
    (d) The flare of each deal of paper pull-tabs and tipboards sold by a manufacturer for use or resale
in Minnesota must have imprinted on it a symbol that is at least one inch high and one inch wide
consisting of an outline of the geographic boundaries of Minnesota with the letters "MN" inside the
outline. The flare must be placed inside the wrapping of the deal which the flare describes.
    (e) Each paper pull-tab and tipboard flare must bear the following statement printed in letters
large enough to be clearly legible:
   "Pull-tab (or tipboard) purchasers ญ This pull-tab (or tipboard) game is not legal in Minnesota
unless:
   ญ an outline of Minnesota with letters "MN" inside it is imprinted on this sheet, and
   ญ the serial number imprinted on the bar code at the bottom of this sheet is the same as the serial
number on the pull-tab (or tipboard) ticket you have purchased."
   (f) The flare of each paper pull-tab and tipboard game must have the serial number of the game
imprinted on the bar code at the bottom of the flare in numerals at least one-half inch high.
   Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.163, subdivision 6, is amended to read:

subdivision, a manufacturer is also required to submit the applicable version of any software
necessary to operate electronic devices and related systems.
    (b) The board shall inspect and test all the equipment, including software and software upgrades,
it deems necessary to determine the equipment's compliance with law and board rules. Samples
required under this subdivision must be approved by the board before the equipment being sampled
is shipped into or sold for use or resale in this state. The board shall impose a fee of $25 for each item
of gambling equipment that the manufacturer submits for approval or for which the manufacturer
requests approval. The board shall impose a fee of $100 for each sample of gambling equipment
that it tests.
    (c) The board may require samples of gambling equipment to be tested by an independent testing
laboratory prior to submission to the board for approval. All costs of testing by an independent
testing laboratory must be borne by the manufacturer. An independent testing laboratory used by
a manufacturer to test samples of gambling equipment must be approved by the board before the
equipment is submitted to the laboratory for testing.
    (d) The board may request the assistance of the commissioner of public safety and the director
of the State Lottery in performing the tests.

   Sec. 46. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.1635, subdivision 3, is amended to read:

this chapter;
    (2) detailed plans and specifications for the operation of the linked bingo game and the linked
bingo system, along with a proposed fee schedule for the cost of providing services and equipment to
licensed organizations which may not exceed 15 percent of gross profits, unless a higher percentage,
not to exceed 20 percent, is authorized by the board. The fee schedule must incorporate costs paid
to distributors for services provided under subdivision 5; and
   (3) any other information required by the board by rule.

    Subd. 5. Linked bingo game services requirements. (a) A linked bingo game provider must
contract with licensed distributors for linked bingo game services including, but not limited to, the
solicitation of agreements with licensed organizations, and installation, repair, or maintenance of

organizations, and shall approve for use by organizations any cash register that meets the standards;

section 297E.021, subdivision 2, for the next fiscal year will be less than the amounts specified
in section 297E.021, subdivision 3, paragraph (a), clause (1), items (i) to (iii), for that fiscal year,
the commissioner may implement the revenue options authorized in this article; provided that this
section does not constitute a pledge of tax revenues as security for the payment of principal and
interest on appropriation bonds issued under section 16A.695. If the commissioner determines to
exercise the authority under this section for a fiscal year, the commissioner must implement the
revenue options, as necessary, in the following order:

fund.
    (c) If the commissioner determines to implement one or more of the revenue options authorized
by this section, each subsequent year the commissioner must determine if the revenue is needed and
will be imposed and collected for the next fiscal year. If the commissioner determines that one or
more revenue options implemented for a fiscal year are not needed for a subsequent fiscal year, the
commissioner must terminate them in the reverse order they were required to be implemented by
paragraph (a) with the last option implemented terminated first and so forth.
   (d) Before implementing a revenue source authorized under this section, the commissioner
must report the intent to do so to the Legislative Commission on Planning and Fiscal Policy. The
commissioner must inform the commission of determinations to continue or discontinue each
revenue source for a subsequent fiscal year.
    (e) The provisions of this section no longer apply after the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority
certifies to the commissioner that it has determined that the revenues of the general fund under
section 297A.994, the increased revenues under chapter 297E, and other available resources of the
authority provide adequate financial security for the state and the authority.
   Sec. 2. [349A.20] STADIUM, SPORTS-THEMED GAMES.

generate a minimum of $2,100,000 in additional revenue for the fiscal year for the general fund.

the authority shall by resolution impose and maintain a ten percent tax on the gross receipts received
for the rental of suites, sky boxes, and similar in the NFL stadium.
    (b) The tax must be imposed in the years specified by the commissioner of management and

seller to the authority. A tax imposed under this section is recoverable at law by the authority from
the seller in the same manner as other debts. Every person granting, selling, or renting suites, sky
boxes, or similar may be required, as provided in resolutions of the authority, to secure a permit, to
file returns, to deposit security for the payment of the tax, and to pay the penalties for nonpayment
and interest on late payments, as the authority deems necessary or expedient to assure the prompt
and uniform collection of either or both of the taxes.
   (c) The authority shall remit the proceeds of a tax imposed under this section to the commissioner
of management and budget for deposit in the state's general fund."
