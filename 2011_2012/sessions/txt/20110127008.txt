sections 477A.0133 and 477A.0134. No taxing jurisdiction's market value credit reimbursements
are reduced to less than zero under this subdivision. The commissioner of revenue shall pay the
annual market value credit reimbursement amounts, after reduction under this subdivision, to the
affected city or county as provided in this section.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for credit reimbursements in 2011 and thereafter.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.50, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. General right to refund. (a) Subject to the requirements of this section and
section 289A.40, a taxpayer who has paid a tax in excess of the taxes lawfully due and who files a
written claim for refund will be refunded or credited the overpayment of the tax determined by the
commissioner to be erroneously paid.
    (b) The claim must specify the name of the taxpayer, the date when and the period for which the
tax was paid, the kind of tax paid, the amount of the tax that the taxpayer claims was erroneously
paid, the grounds on which a refund is claimed, and other information relative to the payment and in
the form required by the commissioner. An income tax, estate tax, or corporate franchise tax return,
or amended return claiming an overpayment constitutes a claim for refund.
    (c) When, in the course of an examination, and within the time for requesting a refund, the
commissioner determines that there has been an overpayment of tax, the commissioner shall
refund or credit the overpayment to the taxpayer and no demand is necessary. If the overpayment
exceeds $1, the amount of the overpayment must be refunded to the taxpayer. If the amount of the
overpayment is less than $1, the commissioner is not required to refund. In these situations, the
commissioner does not have to make written findings or serve notice by mail to the taxpayer.
    (d) If the amount allowable as a credit for withholding, estimated taxes, or dependent care
exceeds the tax against which the credit is allowable, the amount of the excess is considered
an overpayment. T   ­h

percent of the gross rent actually paid in cash, or its equivalent, or the portion of rent paid in lieu
of property taxes, in any calendar year by a claimant for the right of occupancy of the claimant's

    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290A.03, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
     Subd. 13. Property taxes payable. "Property taxes payable" means the property tax exclusive
of special assessments, penalties, and interest payable on a claimant's homestead after deductions
made under sections 273.135, 273.1384, 273.1391, 273.42, subdivision 2, and any other state paid
property tax credits in any calendar year, and after any refund claimed and allowable under section
290A.04, subdivision 2h, that is first payable in the year that the property tax is payable. In the case of
a claimant who makes ground lease payments, "property taxes payable" includes the amount of the
payments directly attributable to the property taxes assessed against the parcel on which the house
is located. No apportionment or reduction of the "property taxes payable" shall be required for the
use of a portion of the claimant's homestead for a business purpose if the claimant does not deduct
any business depreciation expenses for the use of a portion of the homestead in the determination of
federal adjusted gross income. For homesteads which are manufactured homes as defined in section
273.125, subdivision 8, and for homesteads which are park trailers taxed as manufactured homes
under section 168.012, subdivision 9, "property taxes payable" shall also include ­        1­9 15 percent
of the gross rent paid in the preceding year for the site on which the homestead is located. When a
homestead is owned by two or more persons as joint tenants or tenants in common, such tenants shall
determine between them which tenant may claim the property taxes payable on the homestead. If
they are unable to agree, the matter shall be referred to the commissioner of revenue whose decision
shall be final. Property taxes are considered payable in the year prescribed by law for payment of
the taxes.
    In the case of a claim relating to "property taxes payable," the claimant must have owned and
occupied the homestead on January 2 of the year in which the tax is payable and (i) the property must
have been classified as homestead property pursuant to section 273.124, on or before December 15
of the assessment year to which the "property taxes payable" relate; or (ii) the claimant must provide

2,500 must not be less than the amount it was certified to receive in the previous year minus the
lesser of $10 multiplied by its population, or five percent of its 2003 certified aid amount. For aids
payable in 2009 only, the total aid for a city with a population less than 2,500 must not be less than

aid under section 477A.011, subdivision 36, paragraph (s), in which case its minimum aid is zero.
    (e) A city's aid loss under this section may not exceed $300,000 in any year in which the total city
aid appropriation under section 477A.03, subdivision 2a, is equal or greater than the appropriation
under that subdivision in the previous year, unless the city has an adjustment in its city net tax
capacity under the process described in section 469.174, subdivision 28.
    (f) If a city's net tax capacity used in calculating aid under this section has decreased in any year
by more than 25 percent from its net tax capacity in the previous year due to property becoming
tax-exempt Indian land, the city's maximum allowed aid increase under paragraph (c) shall be
increased by an amount equal to (1) the city's tax rate in the year of the aid calculation, multiplied
by (2) the amount of its net tax capacity decrease resulting from the property becoming tax exempt.

section equal to the lesser of (1) the total amount of aid it received under this section in 2010 after the
reductions under sections 477A.0133 and 477A.0134, and reduced by the amount of payments made
under section 477A.011, subdivision 36, paragraphs (y) and (z), and, for 2011 only, increased by
the aid base adjustment under section 477A.011, subdivision 36, paragraph (aa), or (2) the amount
it was certified to receive in 2011 under subdivision 9.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for aids payable in calendar years 2011 and 2012.

described in section 7871(c) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be treated as interest income on
obligations of the state in which the tribe is located;
    (2) the amount of income, sales and use, motor vehicle sales, or excise taxes paid or accrued

Internal Revenue Code;
    (7) 80 percent of the depreciation deduction allowed under section 168(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code. For purposes of this clause, if the taxpayer has an activity that in the taxable year
generates a deduction for depreciation under section 168(k) and the activity generates a loss for the
taxable year that the taxpayer is not allowed to claim for the taxable year, "the depreciation allowed
under section 168(k)" for the taxable year is limited to excess of the depreciation claimed by the
activity under section 168(k) over the amount of the loss from the activity that is not allowed in
the taxable year. In succeeding taxable years when the losses not allowed in the taxable year are
