The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
The Honorable Kurt Zellers
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 86 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
   That the House recede from its amendment and that S.F. No. 86 be further amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 216H.03, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7. Other exemptions. The prohibitions in subdivision 3 do not apply to:
    (1) a new large energy facility under consideration by the Public Utilities Commission pursuant
to proposals or applications filed with the Public Utilities Commission before April 1, 2007, or to
any power purchase agreement related to a facility described in this clause. The exclusion of pending
proposals and applications from the prohibitions in subdivision 3 does not limit the applicability of
any other law and is not an expression of legislative intent regarding whether any pending proposal
or application should be approved or denied;
    (2) a contract not subject to commission approval that was entered into prior to April 1, 2007,
to purchase power from a new large energy facility that was approved by a comparable authority in
another state prior to that date, for which municipal or public power district bonds have been issued,
and on which construction has begun; ­    o­
                                           r

a new large energy facility located outside Minnesota that the Public Utilities Commission has
determined is essential to ensure the long-term reliability of Minnesota's electric system, to allow
electric service for increased industrial demand, or to avoid placing a substantial financial burden
on Minnesota ratepayers. An order of the commission granting an exemption under this clause is
stayed until the June 1 following the next regular or annual session of the legislature that begins
after the date of the commission's final order; or
    (4) 1,500 megawatts of electric generating capacity, in aggregate, from new large energy
facilities or power purchase agreements with those new large energy facilities that:
   (i) are fueled by feedstock coal; and
   (ii) began construction after April 1, 2007.
Projects will receive priority for exemption under this clause based on the shortest amount of time
after April 1, 2007, and the date construction of a new large energy facility begins. Power purchase
agreements with new large energy facilities that are exempt from the prohibitions in subdivision
3 pursuant to this clause are also exempt from the prohibitions in subdivision 3. An exemption
under this clause is not valid unless certified by the Public Utilities Commission. The commission
must certify a request for an exemption if it finds the request and the grant of the exemption is in
compliance with this clause.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment."
   Delete the title and insert:
    "A bill for an act relating to energy; modifying ban on increased carbon dioxide emissions by
utilities; amending Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 216H.03, subdivision 7."
   We request the adoption of this report and repassage of the bill.

                                        SPECIAL ORDER

    H.F. No. 954: A bill for an act relating to counties; providing a process for making certain county
offices appointive in Kittson County.
   Senator Stumpf moved to amend H.F. No. 954 as follows:
   Page 2, after line 16, insert:
   "Sec. 2. MARSHALL COUNTY OFFICES MAY BE APPOINTED.
    Subdivision 1. Authority to make office appointive. Notwithstanding Minnesota Statutes,
section 382.01, upon adoption of a resolution by the Marshall County Board of Commissioners,
the offices of county recorder and county auditor-treasurer are not elective but must be filled by
appointment by the county board as provided in the resolution.
    Subd. 2. Board controls; may change as long as duties done. Upon adoption of a resolution
by the Marshall County Board of Commissioners and subject to subdivisions 3 and 4, the duties
of an elected official required by statute whose office is made appointive as authorized by this
section must be discharged by the Marshall County Board of Commissioners acting through a
department head appointed by the board for that purpose. Reorganization, reallocation, delegation,
or other administrative change or transfer does not diminish, prohibit, or avoid the discharge of
duties required by statute.
    Subd. 3. Incumbents to complete term. The person elected at the last general election to
an office made appointive under this section must serve in that capacity and perform the duties,
functions, and responsibilities required by statute until the completion of the term of office to which
the person was elected or until a vacancy occurs in the office, whichever occurs earlier.
    Subd. 4. Publishing resolution; petition, referendum. (a) Before the adoption of the resolution
to provide for the appointment of the county recorder and county auditor-treasurer, the county board
must publish a proposed resolution notifying the public of its intent to consider the issue once each
week for two consecutive weeks in the official publication of the county. Following publication and
prior to formally adopting the resolution, the county board shall provide an opportunity at its next
regular meeting for public comment relating to the issue. After the public comment opportunity, at
the same meeting or a subsequent meeting, the Marshall County Board of Commissioners may adopt
a resolution that provides for the appointment of the county recorder and county auditor-treasurer as
permitted in this section. The resolution must be approved by at least 80 percent of the members of
the county board. The resolution may take effect 60 days after it is adopted, or at a later date stated
in the resolution, unless a petition is filed as provided in paragraph (b).
    (b) Within 60 days after the county board adopts the resolution, a petition requesting a
referendum may be filed with the county auditor-treasurer. The petition must be signed by at least
ten percent of the registered voters of Marshall County. The petition must meet the requirements
of the secretary of state, as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 204B.071, and any rules
adopted to implement that section. If the petition is sufficient, the question of appointing the county
recorder and county auditor-treasurer must be placed on the ballot at a regular or special election.
If a majority of the voters of the county voting on the question vote in favor of appointment, the
resolution may be implemented.

    Subd. 5. Reverting to elected offices. (a) The county board may adopt a resolution to provide
for the election of an office made an appointed position under this section, but not until at least three
years after the office was made an appointed position. The county board must publish a proposed
resolution notifying the public of its intent to consider the issue once each week for two consecutive
weeks in the official publication of the county. Following publication and before formally adopting
the resolution, the county board must provide an opportunity at its next regular meeting for public
comment relating to the issue. After the public comment hearing, the county board may adopt the
resolution. The resolution must be approved by at least 60 percent of the members of the county
board and is effective August 1 following adoption of the resolution.
    (b) The question of whether an office made an appointed position under this section must be
made an elected office must be placed on the ballot at the next general election if (1) the position
has been an appointed position for at least three years, (2) a petition signed by at least ten percent of
the registered voters of the county is filed with the office of the county auditor-treasurer by August
1 of the year in which the general election is held, and (3) the petition meets the requirements of
the secretary of state, as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 204B.071, and any rules adopted
to implement that section. If a majority of the voters of the county voting on the question vote in
favor of making the office an elected position, the election for that office must be held at the next
regular or special election."

    "Section 2 is effective the day after the Marshall County Board of Commissioners and its
chief clerical officer timely complete their compliance with Minnesota Statutes, section 645.021,
subdivisions 2 and 3."

    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 518B.01, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
    Subd. 8. Service; alternate service; publication; notice. (a) The petition and any order issued
under this section other than orders for dismissal shall be served on the respondent personally. Orders
for dismissal may be served personally or by certified mail. In lieu of personal service of an order for
protection, a law enforcement officer may serve a person with a short form notification as provided
in subdivision 8a.
    (b) When service is made out of this state and in the United States, it may be proved by the
affidavit of the person making the service. When service is made outside the United States, it may
be proved by the affidavit of the person making the service, taken before and certified by any United
States minister, charge d'affaires, commissioner, consul, or commercial agent, or other consular
or diplomatic officer of the United States appointed to reside in the other country, including all
deputies or other representatives of the officer authorized to perform their duties; or before an office
authorized to administer an oath with the certificate of an officer of a court of record of the country
in which the affidavit is taken as to the identity and authority of the officer taking the affidavit.
    (c) If personal service cannot be made, the court may order service of the petition and any order
issued under this section by alternate means, or by publication, which publication must be made as
in other actions. The application for alternate service must include the last known location of the
respondent; the petitioner's most recent contacts with the respondent; the last known location of the
respondent's employment; the names and locations of the respondent's parents, siblings, children,
and other close relatives; the names and locations of other persons who are likely to know the
respondent's whereabouts; and a description of efforts to locate those persons.
    The court shall consider the length of time the respondent's location has been unknown, the
likelihood that the respondent's location will become known, the nature of the relief sought, and
the nature of efforts made to locate the respondent. The court shall order service by first class mail,
forwarding address requested, to any addresses where there is a reasonable possibility that mail or
information will be forwarded or communicated to the respondent.
    The court may also order publication, within or without the state, but only if it might reasonably
succeed in notifying the respondent of the proceeding. Service shall be deemed complete 14 days
after mailing or 14 days after court-ordered publication.
    (d) A petition and any order issued under this section, including the short form notification, must
62ND DAY]                                 SATURDAY, MAY 21, 2011                                                  3063

include a notice to the respondent that if an order for protection is issued to protect the petitioner
or a child of the parties, upon request of the petitioner in any parenting time proceeding, the court
shall consider the order for protection in making a decision regarding parenting time.

    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 354A.29, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7. Eligibility for payment of postretirement adjustments. (a) Annually, after June 30,

    (b) On January 1, each eligible person who has been receiving an annuity or benefit under the
articles of incorporation, the bylaws, or this chapter for at least three calendar months as of the end of

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2011.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 354A.29, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
62ND DAY]                           SATURDAY, MAY 21, 2011                                       3075

    Subd. 8. Calculation of postretirement adjustments; transitional provision. (a) For purposes
of computing postretirement adjustments for eligible benefit recipients of the St. Paul Teachers
Retirement Fund Association, the accrued liability funding ratio based on the actuarial value of
assets of the plan as determined by the most recent actuarial valuation prepared under sections
356.214 and 356.215 determines the postretirement increase, as follows:
            Funding ratio                           Postretirement increase
            Less than 80 percent                    1 percent
            At least 80 percent but less than
            90 percent                              2 percent

    (b) The amount determined under paragraph (a) is the full postretirement increase to be applied
as a permanent increase to the regular payment of each eligible member on January 1 of the next
calendar year. For any eligible member whose effective date of benefit commencement occurred
during the calendar year before the postretirement increase is applied, the full increase amount must
be prorated on the basis of whole calendar quarters in benefit payment status in the calendar year
prior to the January 1 on which the postretirement increase is applied, calculated to the third decimal
place.
    (c) If the accrued liability funding ratio based on the actuarial value of assets is at least 90
percent, this subdivision expires and subsequent postretirement increases must be paid as specified
in subdivision 9.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2011.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 354A.29, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 9. Calculation of postretirement adjustments. (a) This subdivision applies if
subdivision 8 has expired.
    (b) A percentage adjustment must be computed and paid under this subdivision to eligible
persons under subdivision 7. This adjustment is determined by reference to the Consumer Price
Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers all items index as reported by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics within the United States Department of Labor each year as part of the determination
of annual cost-of-living adjustments to recipients of federal old-age, survivors, and disability
insurance. For calculations of postretirement adjustments under paragraph (c), the term "average
third quarter Consumer Price Index value" means the sum of the monthly index values as initially
reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the months of July, August, and September, divided
by three.
   (c) Before January 1 of each year, the executive director must calculate the amount of the
postretirement adjustment by dividing the most recent average third quarter index value by the
same average third quarter index value from the previous year, subtract one from the resulting
quotient, and express the result as a percentage amount, which must be rounded to the nearest
one-tenth of one percent.
    (d) The amount calculated under paragraph (c) is the full postretirement adjustment to be applied
as a permanent increase to the regular payment of each eligible member on January 1 of the next
calendar year. For any eligible member whose effective date of benefit commencement occurred

during the calendar year before the postretirement adjustment is applied, the full increase amount
must be prorated on the basis of whole calendar quarters in benefit payment status in the calendar
year prior to the January 1 on which the postretirement adjustment is applied, calculated to the third
decimal place.
      (e) The adjustment must not be less than zero nor greater than five percent.

the member terminated service on the date of death. The surviving spouse eligible for a surviving
spouse benefit under this paragraph may apply for the annuity at any time after the date on which
the deceased employee would have attained the required age for retirement based on the employee's
allowable service. A surviving spouse eligible for surviving spouse benefits under paragraph (b)

spouse shall be paid a joint and survivor annuity under section 354A.32 and computed under section

using the full early retirement reduction under section 354A.31, subdivision 6, paragraph (a), to age
55 and one-half of the early retirement reduction from age 55 to the age payment begins.

salary determined under section 354A.31 must be used for each period, and the monthly annuity
amount related to each period must be augmented as provided in this subdivision. The sum of the
augmented monthly annuity amounts determines the total deferred annuity payable. If a person
repays a refund, the service restored by the repayment must be considered as continuous with the
next period of service for which the person has credit with the fund. If a person does not render
teaching services in any one fiscal year or more consecutive fiscal years and then resumes teaching
service, the formula percentages used from the date of resumption of teaching service are those
applicable to new members. The mortality table and interest assumption used to compute the
annuity are the table established by the fund to compute other annuities, and the interest assumption

u ­d­­
     e­r to the teachers retirement plan within one year of the faculty member first achieving tenure
or its equivalent at a Minnesota state college or university. The faculty member electing Teachers
Retirement Association coverage under this paragraph must purchase service credit in the Teachers
Retirement Association for the entire period of time covered under the individual retirement account
plan and the purchase payment amount must be determined under section 356.551. The Teachers
Retirement Association may charge a faculty member transferring coverage a reasonable fee to cover
the costs associated with computing the actuarial cost of purchasing service credit and making the
transfer. A faculty member transferring from the individual retirement account plan to the Teachers
Retirement Association may use any balances to the credit of the faculty member in the individual
retirement account plan, any balances to the credit of the faculty member in the higher education
supplemental retirement plan established under chapter 354C, or any source specified in section
356.441, subdivision 1, to purchase the service credit in the Teachers Retirement Association. If the
total amount of payments under this paragraph are less than the total purchase payment amount under
section 356.551, the payment amounts must be refunded to the applicable source. The retirement
coverage transfer and service credit purchase authority under this paragraph expires with respect to
any Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System faculty initially hired after June 30, 2014.

   (b) If an eligible person is employed by the board before July 1, 2011, in an eligible unclassified
administrative position or in a faculty position in a technical college, community college, or state
university, the retirement coverage is by the plan established by this chapter, unless otherwise
specified in this section.
    (c) An eligible person described in paragraph (b), except that first employment by the board is on
or after July 1, 2011, has retirement coverage by the plan established by this chapter if the eligible
person has no:
      (1) allowable service credit in any plan listed in section 356.30, subdivision 3; or
   (2) prior employment covered by the state unclassified employees retirement program under
chapter 352D.
   (d) An eligible person described in paragraph (c) has retirement coverage by the Teachers
Retirement Association if the person has:
   (1) prior employment covered by the state unclassified employees retirement program under
chapter 352D and has not withdrawn or transferred assets from that account; or
      (2) allowable service credit in a plan listed in section 356.30, subdivision 3.
    (e) To ensure that coverage is provided by the proper plan, the employee must certify to
the board the existence of any service credit in any plan listed in section 356.30, subdivision 3,
or whether the person retains a state unclassified employees retirement program account. If an
employee fails to correctly certify prior membership in a plan or the existence of an unclassified
program account, the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system and its board shall be
held harmless, and notwithstanding any law to the contrary, any resulting cost or financial liability
becomes the employee's responsibility.

subdivision 3, if an employee of the board was employed in a faculty position in a technical
college on June 30, 1997, with coverage by the Teachers Retirement Association, the employee
retains that coverage. If the employee was a technical college faculty member on June 30, 1995,
covered by a first class city teacher retirement fund established under chapter 354A, the retirement
coverage continues with the Duluth Teachers Retirement Fund Association or the St. Paul Teachers
Retirement Fund Association, whichever is applicable. If the person was a technical college
faculty member on June 30, 1995, covered by the former Minneapolis Teachers Retirement Fund
Association, the Teachers Retirement Association shall provide coverage.
     (b) An employee under paragraph (a) who has coverage by a first class city teacher fund
association retains that coverage for the duration of the person's employment by the board o                                ­­f

    Subd. 5. Payment for certain prior uncovered service. (a) A person employed in a faculty
position or in an eligible unclassified administrative position by the board who was initially excluded
from participation in the individual retirement account plan coverage, who was not covered by any
other Minnesota public pension plan for that service, and who is subsequently eligible to participate
in the individual retirement account plan may make member contributions for that period of prior
uncovered teaching employment or eligible unclassified administrative employment with the board.
    (b) The member contributions for prior uncovered board service are the amount that the person
would have paid if the prior service had been covered employment. The payment must be made to
the individual retirement account plan administrator and may be made only by payroll deduction.
The payment must be made by the later of:
     (1) 45 days of the start of covered employment; or
     (2) the end of the fiscal year in which covered employment began.
   (c) The board must contribute an amount to match any contribution made by a plan participant

   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 354B.21, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7. Coverage; certain part-time employees. A person employed in a part-time faculty
position or in a part-time eligible unclassified administrative position who does not meet the
definition of covered employment under section 354B.20, subdivision 4, because the employment
does not meet the threshold required under that provision, must certify prior membership in the
Teachers Retirement Association to the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system. If the
certification is incorrect, the employee, and not the employer, is required to pay interest on the
employee and employer contributions, and, if applicable, on the employer additional contributions
to the Teachers Retirement Association under section 354.52, subdivision 4.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2011.
   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 356.47, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Payment. (a) Beginning one year after the reemployment withholding period ends
relating to the reemployment that gave rise to the limitation, and the filing of a written application,
the retired member is entitled to the payment, in a lump sum, of the value of the person's amount
under subdivision 2, plus annual compound interest. For the general state employees retirement plan,
the correctional state employees retirement plan, the general employees retirement plan of the Public
Employees Retirement Association, the public employees police and fire retirement plan, the local
government correctional employees retirement plan, and the teachers retirement plan, the annual
interest rate is six percent from the date on which the amount was deducted from the retirement
annuity to the date of payment or until January 1, 2011, whichever is earlier, and no interest after
January 1, 2011. For the Duluth Teachers Retirement Fund Association, the annual interest is six
percent from the date on which the amount was deducted from the retirement annuity to the date of
payment or until June 30, 2010, whichever is earlier, and with no interest accrual after June 30, 2010.
For the St. Paul Teachers Retirement Fund Association, the annual interest is the rate of six percent
from the date that the amount was deducted from the retirement annuity to the date of payment or
June 30, 2011, whichever is earlier, and with no interest accrual after June 30, 2011.
    (b) The written application must be on a form prescribed by the chief administrative officer of
the applicable retirement plan.
    (c) If the retired member dies before the payment provided for in paragraph (a) is made, the
amount is payable, upon written application, to the deceased person's surviving spouse, or if none,
to the deceased person's designated beneficiary, or if none, to the deceased person's estate.
    (d) In lieu of the direct payment of the person's amount under subdivision 2, on or after the
payment date under paragraph (a), if the federal Internal Revenue Code so permits, the retired
member may elect to have all or any portion of the payment amount under this section paid in
the form of a direct rollover to an eligible retirement plan as defined in section 402(c) of the federal
Internal Revenue Code that is specified by the retired member. If the retired member dies with a
balance remaining payable under this section, the surviving spouse of the retired member, or if

2015, the prior year's unit value plus an increase equal to the adjustment percentage determined
under section 356.415, subdivision 1c, effective for the January 1 of the calendar year.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 353.01, subdivision 16, is amended to read:
   Subd. 16. Allowable service; limits and computation. (a) "Allowable service" means:
   (1) service during years of actual membership in the course of which employee deductions were
withheld from salary and contributions were made at the applicable rates under section 353.27,
353.65, or 353E.03;
   (2) periods of service covered by payments in lieu of salary deductions under sections 353.27,
subdivision 12, and 353.35;
   (3) service in years during which the public employee was not a member but for which the
member later elected, while a member, to obtain credit by making payments to the fund as permitted
by any law then in effect;
   (4) a period of authorized leave of absence with pay from which deductions for employee
contributions are made, deposited, and credited to the fund;
    (5) a period of authorized personal, parental, or medical leave of absence without pay, including
a leave of absence covered under the federal Family Medical Leave Act, that does not exceed one
year, and for which a member obtained service credit for each month in the leave period by payment
under section 353.0161 to the fund made in place of salary deductions. An employee must return to
public service and render a minimum of three months of allowable service in order to be eligible to
make payment under section 353.0161 for a subsequent authorized leave of absence without pay.
Upon payment, the employee must be granted allowable service credit for the purchased period;
    (6) a periodic, repetitive leave that is offered to all employees of a governmental subdivision.
The leave program may not exceed 208 hours per annual normal work cycle as certified to the
association by the employer. A participating member obtains service credit by making employee
contributions in an amount or amounts based on the member's average salary, excluding overtime
pay, that would have been paid if the leave had not been taken. The employer shall pay the employer
and additional employer contributions on behalf of the participating member. The employee and
the employer are responsible to pay interest on their respective shares at the rate of 8.5 percent
a year, compounded annually, from the end of the normal cycle until full payment is made. An
employer shall also make the employer and additional employer contributions, plus 8.5 percent
interest, compounded annually, on behalf of an employee who makes employee contributions but
terminates public service. The employee contributions must be made within one year after the
end of the annual normal working cycle or within 30 days after termination of public service,
whichever is sooner. The executive director shall prescribe the manner and forms to be used by a
governmental subdivision in administering a periodic, repetitive leave. Upon payment, the member
must be granted allowable service credit for the purchased period;
    (7) an authorized temporary or seasonal layoff under subdivision 12, limited to three months
allowable service per authorized temporary or seasonal layoff in one calendar year. An employee
who has received the maximum service credit allowed for an authorized temporary or seasonal
layoff must return to public service and must obtain a minimum of three months of allowable service
subsequent to the layoff in order to receive allowable service for a subsequent authorized temporary
62ND DAY]                           SATURDAY, MAY 21, 2011                                        3095

or seasonal layoff;
    (8) a period during which a member is absent from employment by a governmental subdivision
by reason of service in the uniformed services, as defined in United States Code, title 38, section
4303(13), if the member returns to public service with the same governmental subdivision upon
discharge from service in the uniformed service within the time frames required under United States
Code, title 38, section 4312(e), provided that the member did not separate from uniformed service
with a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge or under other than honorable conditions. The service
must be credited if the member pays into the fund equivalent employee contributions based upon the
contribution rate or rates in effect at the time that the uniformed service was performed multiplied
by the full and fractional years being purchased and applied to the annual salary rate. The annual
salary rate is the average annual salary, excluding overtime pay, during the purchase period that the
member would have received if the member had continued to be employed in covered employment
rather than to provide uniformed service, or, if the determination of that rate is not reasonably
certain, the annual salary rate is the member's average salary rate, excluding overtime pay, during
the 12-month period of covered employment rendered immediately preceding the period of the
uniformed service. Payment of the member equivalent contributions must be made during a period
that begins with the date on which the individual returns to public employment and that is three times
the length of the military leave period, or within five years of the date of discharge from the military
service, whichever is less. If the determined payment period is less than one year, the contributions
required under this clause to receive service credit may be made within one year of the discharge
date. Payment may not be accepted following 30 days after termination of public service under
subdivision 11a. If the member equivalent contributions provided for in this clause are not paid in
full, the member's allowable service credit must be prorated by multiplying the full and fractional
number of years of uniformed service eligible for purchase by the ratio obtained by dividing the
total member contributions received by the total member contributions otherwise required under this
clause. The equivalent employer contribution, and, if applicable, the equivalent additional employer
contribution must be paid by the governmental subdivision employing the member if the member
makes the equivalent employee contributions. The employer payments must be made from funds
available to the employing unit, using the employer and additional employer contribution rate or
rates in effect at the time that the uniformed service was performed, applied to the same annual salary
rate or rates used to compute the equivalent member contribution. The governmental subdivision
involved may appropriate money for those payments. The amount of service credit obtainable under
this section may not exceed five years unless a longer purchase period is required under United States
Code, title 38, section 4312. The employing unit shall pay interest on all equivalent member and
employer contribution amounts payable under this clause. Interest must be computed at a rate of 8.5
percent compounded annually from the end of each fiscal year of the leave or the break in service
to the end of the month in which the payment is received. Upon payment, the employee must be
granted allowable service credit for the purchased period; or
   (9) a period specified under subdivision 40.
    (b) For calculating benefits under sections 353.30, 353.31, 353.32, and 353.33 for state officers

    (b) Upon the transfer of assets to the State Board of Investment under paragraph (a), legal title to

and fire retirement plan and fund is not liable for any claim against the Minneapolis Firefighters
Relief Association, its governing board, or its administrative staff acting in a fiduciary capacity,
under chapter 356A or common law, which is founded upon a claim of a breach of fiduciary duty

judicial or administrative proceeding that the Minneapolis Firefighters Relief Association, its board,
or its administrative staff would otherwise have been entitled to assert, and the public employees
police and fire retirement plan may assert any applicable defense that it has in its capacity as a
statewide agency.
    (d) The Public Employees Retirement Association shall indemnify any former fiduciary of the

    Subd. 5. Benefits. The annuities, service pensions, and other retirement benefits of or attributable
to retired, disabled, deferred, or inactive Minneapolis Firefighters Relief Association members who
had that status as of the day before the effective date of consolidation under section 19 continue after
consolidation in the same amount and under the same terms as provided in chapter 423C except that
the unit value is governed by section 353.01, subdivision 10a, and the postretirement adjustments
after December 31, 2015, must be calculated solely under section 353.6511, subdivision 8.
    Subd. 6. Additional employer contributions. (a) As of the effective date of the consolidation
under section 19, the approved actuary retained by the Public Employees Retirement Association
shall calculate the present value of future benefits of the former Minneapolis Firefighters Relief
Association, and, after subtracting the market value of the transferred assets of the former
Minneapolis Firefighters Relief Association and the present value of the employer contribution
under section 353.65, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), shall calculate the remainder present value of
future benefits amount. Annually, following the effective date of consolidation under section 19,
the city of Minneapolis shall pay an amount sufficient to amortize on a level annual dollar basis
the remainder present value of future benefits amount by December 31, 2031. The amortization

payment is payable annually on July 15, beginning in the year following the effective date of the
consolidation. The 2012 payment should be estimated based on the provisions of this legislation.
The July 2013 payment shall be adjusted based on the final actuarial valuation.
    (b) If the postretirement or preretirement interest rate actuarial assumption applicable to the
public employees police and fire retirement plan under section 356.215, subdivision 8, is modified
from the rates specified in section 356.215, subdivision 8, the remainder present value of future
benefits amount calculation under paragraph (a), updated for the passage of time, must be revised
and the amortization contribution by the city of Minneapolis for the balance of the amortization
period must be redetermined and certified to the city of Minneapolis.
    Subd. 7. Health and dental insurance program deductions. The executive director shall
withhold any health insurance or dental insurance premiums designated by the annuitant or benefit
recipient and shall transfer them to the city of Minneapolis. The Public Employees Retirement
Association may charge a necessary and reasonable monthly administrative fee to the city of
Minneapolis for this function and bill it in addition to the employer contribution under section
353.65, subdivision 3, paragraph (b). Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 13 to the contrary,
the executive director shall provide the city of Minneapolis with the current addresses of former
members of the Minneapolis Firefighters Relief Association.
    Subd. 8. Cooperation with fraternal organization. (a) This subdivision applies if the

of the relief association as a fraternal organization under section 16.
    (b) The executive director shall cooperate with the Minneapolis firefighters fraternal association
to insure adequate communication with the former members of the former Minneapolis Firefighters

section 353.665, subdivision 8, or 353.667, subdivision 6, for the duration of the required additional

    (b) The commissioner shall allocate the state aid on the basis of the proportional share of the relief
association or consolidation account of the total unfunded actuarial accrued liability of all recipient
relief associations and consolidation accounts as of December 31, 1993, for relief associations, and
as of June 30, 1994, for consolidation accounts.
    (c) Beginning October 1, 2000, and annually thereafter, the commissioner shall allocate the state
aid, including any state aid in excess of the limitation in subdivision 4, on the following basis:
   (1) 64.5 percent to the municipalities to which section 353.665, subdivision 8, paragraph (b), or
353A.09, subdivision 5, paragraph (b), apply for distribution in accordance with paragraph (b) and
subject to the limitation in subdivision 4;
    (2) 34.2 percent to the city of Minneapolis to fund any unfunded actuarial accrued liability in
the actuarial valuation prepared under sections 356.215 and 356.216 as of the preceding December

    If there is no unfunded actuarial accrued liability in both the Minneapolis Police Relief
Association and the Minneapolis Fire Department Relief Association as disclosed in the most

the commissioner shall allocate that 34.2 percent of the aid as follows: 49 percent to the Teachers
Retirement Association, 21 percent to the St. Paul Teachers Retirement Fund Association, and
30 percent as additional funding to support minimum fire state aid for volunteer firefighters relief
associations. If there is no unfunded actuarial accrued liability in the Virginia Fire Department
Relief Association as disclosed in the most recent actuarial valuation for the relief association
prepared under sections 356.215 and 356.216, the commissioner shall allocate that 1.3 percent of
the aid as follows: 49 percent to the Teachers Retirement Association, 21 percent to the St. Paul
Teachers Retirement Fund Association, and 30 percent as additional funding to support minimum
fire state aid for volunteer firefighters relief associations. Upon the final payment to municipalities
required by section 353.665, subdivision 8, paragraph (b), or 353A.09, subdivision 5, paragraph
(b), the commissioner shall allocate that 64.5 percent of the aid as follows: 20 percent to the St.
Paul Teachers Retirement Fund Association, 20 percent to the city of Minneapolis to fund any

return does not equal or exceed the performance of a composite portfolio assumed passively
managed (indexed) invested ten percent in cash equivalents, 60 percent in bonds and similar debt

securities, and 30 percent in domestic stock calculated using the formula under section 11A.04,
clause (11), the aid allocation to that retirement fund under this section ceases until the five-year

   (d) The amounts required under this subdivision are the amounts annually appropriated to the
commissioner of revenue under section 69.021, subdivision 11, paragraph (e).
  Sec. 16. MINNEAPOLIS FIREFIGHTERS RELIEF ASSOCIATION; SPECIAL

                          ASSOCIATION
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 353.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
3108                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [62ND DAY

    Subd. 10b. Unit value; Minneapolis police. "Unit value," for a member of the public
employees police and fire retirement plan who was a member of the former Minneapolis Police
Relief Association on the day prior to the effective date of consolidation under section 19, is
$86.71 for calendar year 2011, $104.651 for calendar year 2012, $109.011 for calendar year 2013,
$114.825 for calendar year 2014, $124.031 for calendar year 2015, and for calendar years after
calendar year 2015, the prior year's unit value plus an increase equal to the adjustment percentage
determined under section 356.415, subdivision 1c, effective for the January 1 of the calendar year.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 353.01, subdivision 16, is amended to read:
   Subd. 16. Allowable service; limits and computation. (a) "Allowable service" means:
   (1) service during years of actual membership in the course of which employee deductions were
withheld from salary and contributions were made at the applicable rates under section 353.27,
353.65, or 353E.03;
   (2) periods of service covered by payments in lieu of salary deductions under sections 353.27,
subdivision 12, and 353.35;
   (3) service in years during which the public employee was not a member but for which the
member later elected, while a member, to obtain credit by making payments to the fund as permitted
by any law then in effect;
   (4) a period of authorized leave of absence with pay from which deductions for employee
contributions are made, deposited, and credited to the fund;
    (5) a period of authorized personal, parental, or medical leave of absence without pay, including
a leave of absence covered under the federal Family Medical Leave Act, that does not exceed one
year, and for which a member obtained service credit for each month in the leave period by payment
under section 353.0161 to the fund made in place of salary deductions. An employee must return to
public service and render a minimum of three months of allowable service in order to be eligible to
make payment under section 353.0161 for a subsequent authorized leave of absence without pay.
Upon payment, the employee must be granted allowable service credit for the purchased period;
    (6) a periodic, repetitive leave that is offered to all employees of a governmental subdivision.
The leave program may not exceed 208 hours per annual normal work cycle as certified to the
association by the employer. A participating member obtains service credit by making employee
contributions in an amount or amounts based on the member's average salary, excluding overtime
pay, that would have been paid if the leave had not been taken. The employer shall pay the employer
and additional employer contributions on behalf of the participating member. The employee and
the employer are responsible to pay interest on their respective shares at the rate of 8.5 percent
a year, compounded annually, from the end of the normal cycle until full payment is made. An
employer shall also make the employer and additional employer contributions, plus 8.5 percent
interest, compounded annually, on behalf of an employee who makes employee contributions but
terminates public service. The employee contributions must be made within one year after the
end of the annual normal working cycle or within 30 days after termination of public service,
whichever is sooner. The executive director shall prescribe the manner and forms to be used by a
governmental subdivision in administering a periodic, repetitive leave. Upon payment, the member
must be granted allowable service credit for the purchased period;
62ND DAY]                           SATURDAY, MAY 21, 2011                                        3109

    (7) an authorized temporary or seasonal layoff under subdivision 12, limited to three months
allowable service per authorized temporary or seasonal layoff in one calendar year. An employee
who has received the maximum service credit allowed for an authorized temporary or seasonal
layoff must return to public service and must obtain a minimum of three months of allowable service
subsequent to the layoff in order to receive allowable service for a subsequent authorized temporary
or seasonal layoff;
    (8) a period during which a member is absent from employment by a governmental subdivision
by reason of service in the uniformed services, as defined in United States Code, title 38, section
4303(13), if the member returns to public service with the same governmental subdivision upon
discharge from service in the uniformed service within the time frames required under United States
Code, title 38, section 4312(e), provided that the member did not separate from uniformed service
with a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge or under other than honorable conditions. The service
must be credited if the member pays into the fund equivalent employee contributions based upon the
contribution rate or rates in effect at the time that the uniformed service was performed multiplied
by the full and fractional years being purchased and applied to the annual salary rate. The annual
salary rate is the average annual salary, excluding overtime pay, during the purchase period that the
member would have received if the member had continued to be employed in covered employment
rather than to provide uniformed service, or, if the determination of that rate is not reasonably
certain, the annual salary rate is the member's average salary rate, excluding overtime pay, during
the 12-month period of covered employment rendered immediately preceding the period of the
uniformed service. Payment of the member equivalent contributions must be made during a period
that begins with the date on which the individual returns to public employment and that is three times
the length of the military leave period, or within five years of the date of discharge from the military
service, whichever is less. If the determined payment period is less than one year, the contributions
required under this clause to receive service credit may be made within one year of the discharge
date. Payment may not be accepted following 30 days after termination of public service under
subdivision 11a. If the member equivalent contributions provided for in this clause are not paid in
full, the member's allowable service credit must be prorated by multiplying the full and fractional
number of years of uniformed service eligible for purchase by the ratio obtained by dividing the
total member contributions received by the total member contributions otherwise required under this
clause. The equivalent employer contribution, and, if applicable, the equivalent additional employer
contribution must be paid by the governmental subdivision employing the member if the member
makes the equivalent employee contributions. The employer payments must be made from funds
available to the employing unit, using the employer and additional employer contribution rate or
rates in effect at the time that the uniformed service was performed, applied to the same annual salary
rate or rates used to compute the equivalent member contribution. The governmental subdivision
involved may appropriate money for those payments. The amount of service credit obtainable under
this section may not exceed five years unless a longer purchase period is required under United States
Code, title 38, section 4312. The employing unit shall pay interest on all equivalent member and
employer contribution amounts payable under this clause. Interest must be computed at a rate of 8.5
percent compounded annually from the end of each fiscal year of the leave or the break in service
to the end of the month in which the payment is received. Upon payment, the employee must be
granted allowable service credit for the purchased period; or
   (9) a period specified under subdivision 40.
   (b) For calculating benefits under sections 353.30, 353.31, 353.32, and 353.33 for state officers
3110                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [62ND DAY

and employees displaced by the Community Corrections Act, chapter 401, and transferred into
county service under section 401.04, "allowable service" means the combined years of allowable
service as defined in paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (6), and section 352.01, subdivision 11.
    (c) For a public employee who has prior service covered by a local police or firefighters relief
association that has consolidated with the Public Employees Retirement Association under chapter
353A or to which section 353.665 applies, and who has elected the type of benefit coverage
provided by the public employees police and fire fund either under section 353A.08 following the
consolidation or under section 353.665, subdivision 4, "a ­p­p l­c
                                                             ­­i ­­

service credited by the local police or firefighters relief association as of the effective date of the
consolidation based on law and on bylaw provisions governing the relief association on the date
of the initiation of the consolidation procedure.
    (d) No member may receive more than 12 months of allowable service credit in a year either
for vesting purposes or for benefit calculation purposes. For an active member who was an active
member of the former Minneapolis Police Relief Association on the day prior to the effective
date of consolidation under section 19, "allowable service" is the period of service credited by the
Minneapolis Police Relief Association as reflected in the transferred records of the association up
to the effective date of consolidation under section 19 and the period of service credited under
paragraph (a), clause (1), after the effective date of consolidation under section 19.

employees police and fire retirement plan may assert any applicable defense to any claim in any
judicial or administrative proceeding that the Minneapolis Police Relief Association, its board, or
62ND DAY]                           SATURDAY, MAY 21, 2011                                        3117

former Minneapolis Police Relief Association. Consistent with section 69.80, the relief association
may purchase reasonable fiduciary liability tail insurance for its officers and directors prior to the
effective date of consolidation under section 19.

    Subd. 6. Additional employer contributions. (a) As of the effective date of the consolidation
under section 19, the approved actuary retained by the Public Employees Retirement Association

Association, and, after subtracting the market value of the transferred assets of the former
Minneapolis Police Relief Association and the present value of the employer contribution under

    Subd. 4. Relief association financial requirements; minimum municipal obligation. (a) The
officers of the relief association shall determine the financial requirements of the relief association
and minimum obligation of the municipality for the following calendar year in accordance with
the requirements of this subdivision. The financial requirements of the relief association and the
minimum obligation of the municipality must be determined on or before the submission date
established by the municipality under subdivision 5.
    (b) The financial requirements of the relief association for the following calendar year must
be based on the most recent actuarial valuation or survey of the special fund of the association
if more than one fund is maintained by the association, or of the association, if only one fund
is maintained, prepared in accordance with sections 356.215, subdivisions 4 to 15, and 356.216,

as required under subdivision 10. If an actuarial estimate is prepared by the actuary of the relief
association as part of obtaining a modification of the benefit plan of the relief association and the
modification is implemented, the actuarial estimate must be used in calculating the subsequent
financial requirements of the relief association.
    (c) If the relief association has an unfunded actuarial accrued liability as reported in the most
recent actuarial valuation or survey, the total of the amounts calculated under clauses (1), (2), and
(3), constitute the financial requirements of the relief association for the following year. If the relief
association does not have an unfunded actuarial accrued liability as reported in the most recent
actuarial valuation or survey, the amount calculated under clauses (1) and (2) constitute the financial
requirements of the relief association for the following year. The financial requirement elements are:
    (1) the normal level cost requirement for the following year, expressed as a dollar amount, which
must be determined by applying the normal level cost of the relief association as reported in the
actuarial valuation or survey and expressed as a percentage of covered payroll to the estimated
covered payroll of the active membership of the relief association, including any projected change
in the active membership, for the following year;
    (2) for the Bloomington Fire Department Relief Association, the Fairmont Police Relief
Association, and the Virginia Fire Department Relief Association, to the dollar amount of normal
cost determined under clause (1) must be added an amount equal to the dollar amount of the
administrative expenses of the special fund of the association if more than one fund is maintained
by the association, or of the association if only one fund is maintained, for the most recent year,
multiplied by the factor of 1.035. The administrative expenses are those authorized under section

must be used in calculating any required amortization contribution, except that if the actuarial report
for the Bloomington Fire Department Relief Association indicates an unfunded actuarial accrued
liability, the unfunded obligation is to be amortized on a level dollar basis by December 31 of the year
occurring 20 years later, and if subsequent actuarial valuations for the Bloomington Fire Department
Relief Association determine a net actuarial experience loss incurred during the year which ended
as of the day before the most recent actuarial valuation date, any unfunded liability due to that loss
is to be amortized on a level dollar basis by December 31 of the year occurring 20 years later­                  ­­a­

    Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 423A.02, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Amortization state aid. (a) A municipality in which is located a local police
or salaried firefighters' relief association to which the provisions of section 69.77, apply, that had
an unfunded actuarial accrued liability in the most recent relief association actuarial valuation, is
entitled, upon application as required by the commissioner of revenue, to receive local police and
salaried firefighters' relief association amortization state aid if the municipality and the appropriate
relief association both comply with the applicable provisions of sections 69.031, subdivision 5,
69.051, subdivisions 1 and 3, and 69.77.
   (b) The total amount of amortization state aid to all entitled municipalities must not exceed
$5,055,000.
3134                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [62ND DAY

    (c) Subject to the adjustment for the city of Minneapolis provided in this paragraph, the amount
of amortization state aid to which a municipality is entitled annually is an amount equal to the level
annual dollar amount required to amortize, by December 31, 2010, the unfunded actuarial accrued
liability of the special fund of the appropriate relief association as reported in the December 31, 1978,
actuarial valuation of the relief association prepared under sections 356.215 and 356.216, reduced
by the dollar amount required to pay the interest on the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the
special fund of the relief association for calendar year 1981 set at the rate specified in Minnesota
Statutes 1978, section 356.215, subdivision 8. For the city of Minneapolis, the amortization state
aid amount thus determined must be reduced by $747,232 on account of the former Minneapolis
Police Relief Association and by $772,768 on account of the former Minneapolis Fire Department
Relief Association. If the amortization state aid amounts determined under this paragraph exceed
the amount appropriated for this purpose, the amortization state aid for actual allocation must be
reduced pro rata.
    (d) Payment of amortization state aid to municipalities must be made directly to the
municipalities involved in three equal installments on July 15, September 15, and November 15
annually. Upon receipt of amortization state aid, the municipal treasurer shall transmit the aid
amount to the treasurer of the local relief association for immediate deposit in the special fund of
the relief association.
    (e) The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe and periodically revise the form for and content
of the application for the amortization state aid.
   (f) The amount required under this section, as provided in subdivision 3a, is appropriated
annually from the general fund to the commissioner of revenue.

with the procedures and requirements specified by those instruments and by this chapter. If the

and prior to August 1, 2006, and that consists of more than two but fewer than 13 units, may elect

    (1) The election shall be accomplished by recording a declaration or amended declaration, and
a new or amended CIC plat where required, and by approving bylaws or amended bylaws, which

conformity with the procedures and requirements specified by the existing declaration and bylaws
of the common interest community, and by any applicable statutes.
    (2) In a condominium, the preexisting condominium plat shall be the CIC plat and an amended
CIC plat shall be required only if the amended declaration or bylaws contain provisions inconsistent
with the preexisting condominium plat. The condominium's CIC number shall be the apartment
ownership number or condominium number originally assigned to it by the recording officer. In a
cooperative in which the unit owners' interests are characterized as real estate, a CIC plat shall be
required. In a planned community, the preexisting plat or registered land survey recorded pursuant to
chapter 505, 508, or 508A, or the part of the plat or registered land survey upon which the common
interest community is located, shall be the CIC plat.
   (3) The amendment shall comply with section 515B.2-118(a)(3) and (c); except that the
unanimous consent of the unit owners shall not be required for (i) a clarification of the unit
boundary description if the clarified boundary description is substantially consistent with the
preexisting CIC plat, or (ii) changes from common elements to limited common elements that
occur by operation of section 515B.2-109(c) and (d).
    (4) Except as permitted by paragraph (3), no declarant, affiliate of declarant, association, master
association nor unit owner may acquire, increase, waive, reduce or revoke any previously existing
warranty rights or causes of action that one of said persons has against any other of said persons by
reason of exercising the right of election under this subsection.
    (5) A common interest community which elects to be subject to this chapter may, as a part of
the election process, change its form of ownership by complying with section 515B.2-123.
    (e) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, this chapter shall not apply, except by
election pursuant to subsection (d), to the following:
    (1) a planned community which consists of two units, which utilizes a CIC plat complying with
section 515B.2-110(d)(1) and (2), which is not subject to any rights to subdivide or convert units or
to add additional real estate, and which is not subject to a master association;
    (2) a common interest community that consists solely of platted lots or other separate parcels
of real estate designed or utilized for detached single family dwellings or agricultural purposes,
with or without common property, where no association or master association has an obligation to

maintain any building containing a dwelling or any agricultural building located or to be located on
such platted lots or parcels; except that section 515B.4-101(e) shall apply to the sale of such platted

the dwellings as described in the declaration consist solely of proprietary leases having an unexpired
term of fewer than 20 years, including renewal options;
   (4) planned communities utilizing a CIC plat complying with section 515B.2-110(d)(1) and (2)
and cooperatives, which are limited by the declaration to nonresidential uses alone or in combination
with residential rental uses in which individual dwellings do not constitute units or other separate
parcels of real estate; or
    (5) real estate subject only to an instrument or instruments filed primarily for the purpose of
creating or modifying rights with respect to access, utilities, parking, ditches, drainage, or irrigation.
    (f) Section 515B.4-101(e) applies to any platted lot or other parcel of real estate that is subject
to a master declaration and is not subject to or is exempt from this chapter.
     (g) Section 515B.1-106 shall apply to all common interest communities.

    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 515B.2-109, is amended to read:
    515B.2-109 COMMON ELEMENTS AND LIMITED COMMON ELEMENTS.
   (a) Except as limited by the declaration or this chapter, common elements other than limited
common elements may be used in common by all unit owners. Limited common elements are
designated for the exclusive use of the unit owners of the unit or units to which the limited common
elements are allocated, subject to subsection (b) and the rights of the association as set forth in the
declaration, the bylaws or this chapter.
   (b) Except for the limited common elements described in subsections (c) and (d), the declaration
shall specify to which unit or units each limited common element is allocated.
   (c) Unless otherwise provided in the declaration, if any chute, flue, duct, wire, pipe, conduit,
bearing wall, bearing column, or other fixture or improvement: (i) serves one or more but fewer
than all units and is located wholly or partially outside the unit boundaries, it is a limited common
element allocated solely to the unit or units served; (ii) serves all units or any portion of the common
elements, it is a part of the common elements; or (iii) serves only the unit and is located wholly
within the unit boundaries, it is a part of the unit.
    (d) Unless otherwise provided in the declaration, improvements such as shutters, awnings,

window boxes, doorsteps, stoops, porches, balconies, decks, patios, perimeter doors and windows,
and their frames, constructed as part of the original construction to serve a single unit or units, and
authorized replacements and modifications thereof, if located wholly or partially outside the unit
boundaries, are limited common elements allocated solely to the unit or units served.
     (e) If the declaration so provides, and subject to any different licensing provisions in a
declaration recorded before August 1, 2010, the declarant may grant to a unit owner an exclusive
license for the use of a common element originally designed and constructed to serve as a garage
stall, storage locker, or other similar common element space, in which case the common element
license shall be deemed to be appurtenant to the unit owner's unit, subject to transfer if so provided
by the declaration. The declarant shall, at the time the license is granted, provide to the ­

If the declaration so provides, the declarant may require the onetime payment to the declarant of a
consideration for the grant of a license.
     (1) A common element license may be held only by a unit owner, and the purported transfer of
a license to a person other than a unit owner shall be void. Except as provided in the declaration or
this subsection, no interest in the common element license may be held or transferred separate from
the unit,­­­nd

     (2) The right of any declarant to grant a common element license shall terminate at the earlier of
(i) the conveyance of all units to persons other than a declarant or (ii) ten years after the recording
of the declaration.

and the association. The amendment shall be approved by the board of directors of the association
as to form, and compliance with the declaration and this chapter. The association shall establish fair
and reasonable procedures and time frames for the submission and processing of the reallocations,
and shall maintain records thereof. If approved, the association shall cause the amendment to be

    (b) The members of the master association shall be any combination of (i) unit owners, (ii)
associations, (iii) master associations, or (iv) owners of real estate or property owners' associations
not subject to this chapter but only in combination with at least one other category of member.
An association or its members may be members of an entity created before June 1, 1994, which
performs functions similar to those performed by a master association regardless of whether the
entity is subject to this chapter.

    (c) A master association shall be governed by a master board. Except as expressly prohibited
by the master declaration, the master association's articles of incorporation or bylaws, or other
provisions of this chapter, the master board may act in all instances on behalf of the master
association. The directors of a master association shall be elected or, if a nonprofit corporation,
elected or appointed, in a manner consistent with the requirements of the statute under which the
master association is formed and of the master association's articles of incorporation and bylaws,
and subject to the following:
    (1) The master declaration may provide for a period of master developer control of the master
association during which a master developer or a person designated by the master developer may
appoint and remove the officers and directors of the master association. The period of master
developer control begins on the date of the recording of the master declaration and terminates upon
the earliest of the following events:
   (i) the voluntary surrender of the right to appoint directors;
    (ii) the date ten years after the date the master declaration is recorded, unless extended by an
amendment to the master declaration approved in writing by the master developer, and by 67 percent
of the votes of members other than the master developer;
   (iii) the termination date, if any, in the master declaration; or
    (iv) the date when at least 75 percent of the total units and other parcels of real estate referred
to in subsection (e)(1)(vii) have been conveyed to persons other than a master developer, master
association, declarant, or association.
    (2) Upon the termination of the period of master developer control, the master board shall cause
a meeting of the members of the master association to be called and held within 60 days after
said termination, at which time the directors shall be elected by all members, including the master
developer if a member. If the master board fails or refuses to call a meeting of the unit owners
required to be called by this subsection, then the members other than the master developer and
its affiliates, if they are members, may cause the meeting to be called pursuant to the applicable
provisions of the statute under which the master association was created. If the master developer
or its affiliates are members, they shall be deemed to be present at the meeting for purposes of
establishing a quorum regardless of their failure to attend the meeting. The master board shall
thereafter be subject to the following:
    (i) unless otherwise approved by a vote of members other than the master developer or an affiliate
of the master developer, a majority of the directors shall be members, or a natural person designated
by a member that is not a natural person, other than the master developer or an affiliate of the master
developer;
    (ii) subject to the requirements of subsection (c)(2)(i), the articles of incorporation or bylaws
may authorize the master developer or a person designated by the master developer to appoint one
director, who need not be a member. The articles of incorporation or bylaws shall not be amended
to change or terminate the authorization to appoint one director without the written consent of the
master developer or other person possessing the power to appoint; and
  (iii) subject to the requirements of subsection (c)(2)(i), the articles of incorporation or bylaws
may authorize special classes of directors and director voting rights, as follows: (A) classes of
3154                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [62ND DAY

directors, (B) the appointment or election of directors in certain classes by certain classes of
members, or (C) class voting by classes of directors on issues affecting only a certain class or
classes of members, units, or other parcels of real estate, or to otherwise protect the legitimate
interests of such class or classes. No person may utilize such special classes or class voting for the
purpose of evading any limitation imposed by this chapter on master developers or declarants.
    (d) Subject to subsection (c)(1), the officers of a master association shall be elected, appointed,
or designated in a manner consistent with the statute under which the master association is formed
and consistent with the master association articles of incorporation and bylaws.
   (e) The creation and authority of a master association shall be governed by the following
requirements:
   (1) A master declaration shall be recorded in connection with the creation of a master association.
The master declaration shall be executed by the owners of the real estate subjected to the master
declaration and by the master developer if not an owner. The master declaration shall contain, at a
minimum:
   (i) the name of the master association;
   (ii) a legally sufficient description of the real estate which is subject to the master declaration,
identifying any interest in the real estate which will be owned by the master association, and a legally
sufficient description of any other real estate which may be subjected to the master declaration
pursuant to subsection (f);
   (iii) a statement as to whether the real estate subject to, and which may be subjected to, the
master declaration collectively is or collectively will be a separate common interest community;
   (iv) a description of the members of the master association;
    (v) a description of the master association's powers. To the extent described in the master
declaration, a master association has the powers with respect to the master association's members
and the property subject to the master declaration that section 515B.3-102 grants to an association
with respect to the association's members and the property subject to the declaration. A master
association also has the powers delegated to it by an association pursuant to subsection (e)(2)
or by a property owners' association not subject to the chapter; provided (A) that the master
declaration identifies the powers and authorizes the delegation either expressly or by a grant
of authority to the master board of the association or property owners' association and (B) that
the master association board has not refused the delegation pursuant to subsection (e)(4). The
provisions of the declarations of the common interest communities, or the provisions of recorded
instruments governing other property subject to the master declaration, that delegate powers to the
master association shall be consistent with the provisions of the master declaration that govern the
delegation of the powers;
    (vi) a description of the formulas governing the allocation of assessments and member voting
rights, including any special classes or class voting referred to in subsection (c);
    (vii) a statement, based upon the master developer's good faith estimate, of the total number
of units and other parcels of real estate intended for ownership by persons other than a master
developer, master association, declarant, or association that are (A) subject to the master declaration
as initially recorded and (B) intended to be created by the addition of real estate or by the subdivision

of units or other parcels of real estate; and
   (viii) the requirements for amendment of the master declaration, other than an amendment under
subsection (f).
   (2) The declaration of a common interest community located on property subject to a master
declaration may:
   (i) delegate any of the powers described in section 515B.3-102 to the master association;
provided, that a delegation of the powers described in section 515B.3-102(a)(2) is effective only if
expressly stated in the declaration; and
   (ii) authorize the m
                      ­­a­
                         s­e
                          t­­r board to delegate any of the powers described in section 515B.3-102,
except for the powers described in section 515B.3-102(a)(2), to the master association.
    (3) With respect to any other property subject to a master association, there need not be an
instrument other than the master declaration recorded against the property to empower the master
association to exercise powers with respect to the property.
    (4) If a declaration or other recorded instrument authorizes the master board or the board of
a property owners' association to delegate powers to a master association, the master board may
refuse any delegation of powers that does not comply with (i) this chapter, (ii) the declaration or
other recorded instrument, or (iii) the organizational documents of the master association.
    (5) The failure of a declaration, a master board, or an owner of property subject to a master
association to properly delegate some or all of the powers to the master association does not affect
the authority of the master association to exercise those and other powers with respect to other
common interest communities or owners of properties that are subject to the master association.
     (6) Any interest in the real estate subject to a master declaration that subsection (e)(1)(ii) or
(f) indicates will be owned by the master association shall be conveyed to the master association
immediately after the recording of the master declaration or amendment to the master declaration,
as applicable.
   (f) If the master declaration so provides, other real estate may be subjected to the master
declaration. The other real estate shall be subjected to the master declaration by an amendment
executed (i) by the master developer and (ii) by the owner of the other real estate. The amendment
shall identify any ownership interest in the other real estate that will be owned by the master
association.
   (g) Sections 515B.3-103(a), (b), and (g), 515B.3-108, 515B.3-109, 515B.3-110, and 515B.3-112
shall apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association. But the rights of voting, notice, and
other rights enumerated in those sections apply to persons who elect or appoint the directors of a
master board, whether or not those persons are otherwise unit owners within the meaning of this
chapter.
   (h) If so provided in the master declaration, a master association may levy assessments for
common expenses of the master association against its members and the property subject to the
master declaration, and have and foreclose liens securing the assessments. The assessment liens
shall have the same priority against secured parties, shall include the same fees and charges, and
may be foreclosed in the same manner, as assessment liens under section 515B.3-116. The master
3156                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [62ND DAY

association's lien shall have priority as against the lien of an association or property owners'
association subject to the master association, regardless of when the lien arose or was perfected.
    (1) Master association common expenses shall be allocated among the members of the master
association in a fair and equitable manner. If the members include associations or property
owners' associations, then the master assessments may be allocated among and levied against the
associations or property owners' associations, or allocated among and levied against the units or
other parcels of real estate owned by the members of the association or property owners' association.
If so provided in the master declaration, master assessments levied against a member association
or property owners' association are allocated among and levied against the units or other parcels of
real estate owned by the members of the association or property owners' association. If applicable
and appropriate, the formulas and principles described in section 515B.2-108, subsections (b),
(c), (d), and (e), shall be used in making the allocations. The assessment formulas and procedures
described in the declarations of any common interest communities or any instruments governing
other real estate subject to the master association shall not conflict with the formulas and procedures
described in the master declaration.
    (2) Subject to subsection (i), the master declaration may exempt from liability for all or a
portion of master association assessments any person authorized by subsection (c)(1) to appoint
the members of the master board, or any other person, and exempt any unit or other parcel of real
estate owned by the person from a lien for such assessments, until the building containing the unit,
or located within the boundaries of the unit or other parcel of real estate, is substantially completed.
Substantial completion shall be evidenced by a certificate of occupancy in a jurisdiction that issues
that certificate.
    (i) A master association shall not be used, directly or indirectly, to avoid or nullify any warranties
or other obligations for which a declarant of a common interest community subject to the master
association is responsible, or to otherwise avoid the requirements of this chapter.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2011.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 515B.2-124, is amended to read:
   515B.2-124 SEVERANCE OF COMMON INTEREST COMMUNITY.
   (a) Unless the declaration provides otherwise, a part of a common interest community
containing one or more units, with or without common elements, may be severed from the
common interest community, subject to the requirements of this section. Subject to any additional
requirements contained in the declaration, the severance shall be approved in a written severance
agreement complying with this section, executed by:
    (1) unit owners entitled to cast at least 67 percent of the votes in the association, which approval
shall include the approval of unit owners entitled to cast a majority of the votes allocated to units
in the remaining common interest community and the approval of unit owners entitled to cast a
majority of the votes allocated to units in the part of the common interest community being severed;
   (2) declarant until the earlier of five years after the recording of the declaration or the time at
which declarant no longer owns an unsold unit; and
    (3) in the case of a cooperative, all holders of mortgages or contracts for deed on the entire real
estate constituting the cooperative.

    (b) The declaration may specify a smaller percentage for unit owner approval only if all of the
units are restricted to nonresidential use.
    (c) The severance agreement shall specify a severance date by which the severance of the
common interest community shall be accomplished, after which the severance agreement is void.
The severance agreement shall be deemed to grant to the association a power of attorney coupled
with an interest to effect the severance of the common interest community on behalf of the unit
owners and the holders of all other interests in the units, including without limitations the power
to execute the amendment to the declaration, any instruments of conveyance, and all related
instruments.
   (d) The severance agreement shall:
    (1) Approve an amendment to the declaration complying with this chapter, in substantially
the same form to be recorded, and an amendment to the CIC plat if required. The declaration
amendment shall, at a minimum, (i) legally describe the real estate constituting the remaining
common interest community and the real estate being severed, (ii) restate the number of units
in the remaining common interest community, (iii) reallocate the interests of the unit owners in
the remaining common interest community among the remaining units in accordance with the
allocation formula set forth in the declaration, and (iv) recite any easements to which the severed
portion of the common interest community remains subject.
    (2) Approve an amendment to the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the remaining common
interest community, if necessary.
    (3) Authorize the association to execute and record the amended declaration, articles of
incorporation or bylaws on behalf of the unit owners and all other persons holding an interest in
the remaining common interest community, and to take other actions necessary to accomplish the
severance of the common interest community.
    (4) Allocate the assets and liabilities of the association between the association and (i) a new
association formed pursuant to subsection (g), or (ii) the owners of the units being severed, subject
to a lien against their interest in the severed real estate or their share in the assets of the association
in favor of any person that held a security interest in their unit.
    (5) If the units that are being severed from the common interest community will not be included
in a new common interest community that is (i) formed simultaneously with the severance of the
common interest community, and (ii) includes all of the units and substantially all of the common
elements being severed, then the agreement shall contain the written consent of holders of first
mortgages on all units that are being severed, and shall describe in detail the proposed disposition
of all real estate to be severed and all assets of the association allocated to the severed units, and the
distribution of the proceeds of the disposition, if any, consistent with subsection (i).
    (e) The severance agreement or a memorandum of it shall be recorded in every county in which
a part of the common interest community is located. The recording of the severance agreement or
memorandum of it shall, from the date of recording, constitute notice to all persons subsequently
acquiring an interest in the common interest community that the common interest community is
being severed, and that those persons acquire their interests subject to the terms and conditions
contained in the severance agreement and the amendment to the declaration.

    (f) The amendment to the declaration of the remaining common interest community shall be
recorded on or before the severance date or the severance agreement and the amendment to the
declaration are void as of the day after the severance date. The recording of the amendment to the
declaration shall complete the severance of the common interest community and release the severed
part of the common interest community from the declaration without further action by any person.

section 515B.2-110, subsection (c), (i) the CIC plat description relating to the remaining common
interest community, and (ii) the part of the underlying legal description of the real estate in the
declaration creating the common interest community, and any amendments to it, relating to the

registered property, the registrar of titles shall cancel the existing certificates of title for the severed
part of the common interest community and issue certificates of title for the property using the legal
descriptions required by this subsection.

     (a) A special declarant right created or reserved under this chapter may be voluntarily transferred
only by a separate instrument evidencing the transfer recorded in every county in which any part
of the common interest community is located. The separate instrument shall be recorded against
all units in the common interest community, or in the case of a cooperative, against the real estate
owned by the cooperative, or in the case of a condominium on registered land, the instrument must
be filed pursuant to section 508.351, subdivision 3, or 508A.351, subdivision 3. The instrument may
provide for the conveyance of less than all of the special declarant rights, and is not effective unless
executed by the transferor and transferee. A deed in lieu of foreclosure, or other conveyance arising
out of a foreclosure or cancellation, shall not be deemed a voluntary transfer within the meaning of
this section.
   (b) Upon the voluntary transfer of any special declarant right, the liability of a transferor
declarant is as follows:
    (1) A transferor is not relieved of any obligation or liability arising before the transfer and
remains liable for warranty obligations imposed on the transferor by this chapter. Lack of privity
does not deprive any unit owner of standing to maintain an action to enforce any obligation of the
transferor.

    (2) If a successor to any special declarant right is an affiliate of a declarant, the transferor is jointly
and severally liable with the successor for any obligations or liabilities of the successor relating to
the common interest community.
    (3) If a transferor retains any special declarant rights, but transfers other special declarant rights
to a successor who is not an affiliate of the declarant, the transferor is liable for any obligations or
liabilities imposed on a declarant by this chapter or by the declaration relating to the retained special
declarant rights and arising before or after the transfer.
    (4) A transferor has no liability for any act or omission or any breach of a contractual or warranty
obligation arising from the exercise of a special declarant right by a successor declarant who is not
an affiliate of the transferor.
    (c) Upon the voluntary transfer of any special declarant right, the liability of a successor declarant
is as follows:
    (1) A successor to any special declarant right who is an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all
obligations and liabilities imposed on the transferor by this chapter or the declaration.
    (2) A successor to any special declarant right who is not an affiliate of a declarant is subject to
all obligations and liabilities imposed by this chapter or by the declaration, except:
    (i) misrepresentations by any previous declarant;
   (ii) warranty obligations on improvements made by any previous declarant, or made before the
common interest community was created;
    (iii) breach of any fiduciary obligation by any previous declarant or the declarant's appointees
to the board;
   (iv) any liability or obligation imposed on the transferor as a result of the transferor's acts or
omissions after the transfer; and
   (v) any liability arising out of a special declarant right which was not transferred as provided in
subsection (a).
    (d) In case of foreclosure of a mortgage or cancellation of a contract for deed or other security
interest (or conveyance in lieu thereof), sale by a trustee under an agreement creating a security
interest, tax sale, judicial sale, or sale under bankruptcy code or receivership proceedings, of any
units or additional real estate, or interest therein, owned by a declarant, a person acquiring title to the
property or interests succeeds to all special declarant rights related to the property or interests held by
that declarant and acquired by it unless (i) the mortgage instrument or other instrument creating the
security interest, (ii) the instrument conveying title, or (iii) a separate instrument signed by the person
and recorded within 60 days after the person acquires title to the property or interests, provides for
transfer of less than all special declarant rights. The separate instrument need be recorded only
against the title to the units or interests other than those being acquired under this subsection, or in
the case of a cooperative, against the real estate owned by the cooperative. The declarant shall cease
to have or exercise any special declarant rights which are transferred. If the person has limited the
transfer of certain special declarant rights as provided in this subsection, then it and its successor's
liability shall be limited, as follows:

office and signs, and if that party is not an affiliate of a declarant, it is not subject to any liability or
obligations as a declarant, except the obligation to provide a disclosure statement and any liability
arising from that obligation, and it may not exercise any other special declarant rights.
    (2) If the person or its successor is not an affiliate of a declarant, it may declare its intention
in a recorded instrument as provided in subsection (a) to acquire all special declarant rights and
hold those rights solely for transfer to another person. Thereafter, until the special declarant rights
are transferred to a person acquiring title to any unit owned by the successor, or until a separate
instrument is recorded permitting exercise of all of those rights, that successor may not exercise any
of those rights other than the right to control the board of directors in accordance with the provisions
of section 515B.3-103 for the duration of any period of declarant control. So long as any successor
may not exercise its special declarant rights under this subsection, it is not subject to any liability or
obligation as a declarant other than liability for its acts and omissions under section 515B.3-103.
    (e) Any attempted exercise by a purported successor to a special declarant right which is not
transferred as provided in this section is void, and any purported successor attempting to exercise
that right shall be liable for any damages arising out of its actions.
    (f) Nothing in this section shall subject any successor to a special declarant right to any claims
against or other obligations of a transferor declarant, other than claims and obligations arising under
this chapter, or the declaration or bylaws.
  (g) This section applies only to transfers of special declarant rights that are effective before
August 1, 2010.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
  Sec. 11. [515B.3-1041] SPECIAL DECLARANT RIGHTS; TRANSFER OF SPECIAL
DECLARANT RIGHTS, LIABILITY OF TRANSFEROR AND TRANSFEREE, AND
TERMINATION.
    (a) Except as set forth in subsection (b) or (c), a special declarant right, as defined in section
515B.1-103(33), does not run with title and may only be transferred pursuant to a separate transfer
instrument, titled a "Transfer of Special Declarant Rights," that both the transferor and the transferee
execute.
    (1) A transfer shall be recorded in compliance with applicable law, and is not effective unless the
transferee is the owner of record of a unit or additional real estate at the time the transfer is recorded.
Transfers recorded on or after the effective date of this section shall be recorded against title to all
units in the common interest community.
   (2) A transferor may transfer fewer than all of the special declarant rights the transferor holds
provided that any special declarant rights not transferred are subject to item (i).
    (3) If as a result of a transfer there will be multiple declarants holding special declarant rights, the
transfer shall describe the allocation of each special declarant right between or among the transferor
and each transferee, including, at a minimum, a description of the units or additional real estate to
which the respective special declarant rights apply and the name and address of the owner or owners
of record of the respective units or additional real estate at the time the transfer is recorded.

    (b) If a declarant's ownership interest in a unit, or in additional real estate that may become
subject to the declaration pursuant to the exercise of a special declarant right, is transferred to
another person as a result of the foreclosure, termination, or cancellation of a security interest,
foreclosure of a judgment lien, tax judgment sale, tax forfeited landsale, sale or transfer under
bankruptcy code or receivership proceedings, or other sale or transfer approved by a court, or
is transferred by a deed in lieu of foreclosure, then all special declarant rights that are reserved
to the declarant in the declaration and that relate to the units or additional real estate transferred
are automatically transferred to the person acquiring title from the declarant, and the transfer is
effective as to all special declarant rights, unless or until: (i) the security instrument in the case
of the foreclosure, termination, or cancellation of a security interest, (ii) the instrument effecting
the involuntary transfer, or (iii) a separate instrument executed by the transferee and recorded in
compliance with applicable law within 60 days after the date the transferee acquires title to the
declarant's ownership interest, provides for the transfer of fewer than all of the declarant's special
declarant rights. From and after the effective date of this section, a separate instrument recorded
pursuant to subsection (b), item (iii), shall be recorded against title to all units in the common
interest community. For purposes of this subsection, the transferee shall be deemed to acquire title
upon the expiration of the owner's period of redemption, or reinstatement in the case of contract
for deed. The transferor shall cease to have and shall not exercise any special declarant right
that relates to the transferor's ownership interest in the units or additional real estate transferred,
whether or not the transferee subsequently disclaims the right, but the transferor retains all reserved
special declarant rights that relate to its ownership interest that is not transferred to the transferee.
    (c) If a declarant is an individual rather than a legal entity, and the individual dies, than all special
declarant rights that are reserved to the declarant in the declaration and that relate to the units or
additional real estate owned by the declarant are automatically transferred with the title to said units
or additional real estate.
   (d) A transferor's liability for the performance of obligations that this chapter imposes upon a
declarant is as follows:
    (1) A transferor remains liable under this chapter for all obligations that this chapter imposes
upon a declarant that arise on or before the effective date of the transfer, except that a transferor is not
liable under section 515B.4-112 for any express warranties that a transferee makes to a purchaser.
Except as set forth in subsection (d), clauses (2) and (3), a transferor is not liable under this chapter
for the performance of any obligations that this chapter imposes upon a declarant and arising after
the effective date of the transfer.
    (2) If a transferor and a transferee are affiliates, the transferor and the transferee are jointly and
severally liable under this chapter for the performance of all the obligations that this chapter imposes
upon a declarant, whether such obligations arise before, on, or after the effective date of the transfer.
Upon a subsequent transfer, a prior transferor remains liable to the extent its transferee remains liable
under subsection (d) and is relieved of liability to the same extent that its transferee is relieved of
liability under subsection (e).
    (3) If, following a transfer of special declarant rights, the transferor retains special declarant
rights, the transferor and transferee are jointly and severally liable for the performance of all the
obligations that this chapter imposes upon a declarant and that arise after the effective date of the
transfer, except that the transferor is not liable under section 515B.4-101(b) or 515B.4-102(b),
and section 515B.4-109, 515B.4-110, 515B.4-111, 515B.4-112, 515B.4-113, 515B.4-117, or

515B.4-118, to any purchaser from or through the transferee.
    (e) Except as provided in subsections (g) and (h), a transferee's liability for the performance of
obligations that this chapter imposes upon a declarant is as follows:
    (1) Except as set forth in subsection (e), clause (3), a transferee is liable under this chapter for
all obligations that this chapter imposes upon a declarant and that arise after the effective date of
the transfer. A transferee is not liable under this chapter for the performance of any obligations that
this chapter imposes upon a declarant and that arise before or on the effective date of the transfer,
except that a transferee is liable under section 515B.4-112 for any express warranties the transferee
makes to a purchaser before or on the effective date of the transfer.
    (2) If a transferor and a transferee are affiliates, the transferor and the transferee are jointly and
severally liable under this chapter for the performance of all the obligations that this chapter imposes
upon a declarant, whether such obligations arise before, on, or after the effective date of the transfer.
Upon a subsequent transfer, a prior transferor remains liable to the extent its transferee remains liable
under subsection (d) and is relieved of liability to the same extent that its transferee is relieved of
liability under this subsection.
    (3) If, following a transfer of special declarant rights under subsection (a) or (b), the transferor
retains special declarant rights, the transferor and transferee are jointly and severally liable for the
performance of all the obligations that this chapter imposes upon a declarant and that arise after the
effective date of the transfer, except that the transferee is not liable under section 515B.4-101(b)
or 515B.4-102(b), and section 515B.4-109, 515B.4-110, 515B.4-111, 515B.4-112, 515B.4-113,
515B.4-117, or 515B.4-118, to any purchaser from or through the transferor.
    (f) For purposes of this section, a declarant's obligations under section 515B.3-111(a) arise
when the tort or contract violation occurs, a declarant's obligations to a purchaser under section
515B.4-112 arise when the declarant makes an express warranty to the purchaser and a declarant's
obligations to a purchaser under sections 515B.4-113 and 515B.4-118(a) arise when the declarant
conveys a unit to the purchaser.
     (g) A transferee who acquires special declarant rights pursuant to subsection (b) and who is not an
affiliate of the transferor may record an instrument in compliance with subsection (b) stating that the
transferee elects to acquire only the special declarant rights described in section 515B.1-103(33)(i),
(ii), and (iv). In that case, the transferee is liable as a declarant only to purchasers from said transferee
and only for the obligations of a declarant under sections 515B.4-101(b) and 515B.4-102(b), and
sections 515B.4-109, 515B.4-110, 515B.4-111, 515B.4-113, 515B.4-117, and 515B.4-118, and for
any express warranties under section 515B.4-112 that the transferee makes to purchasers.
    (h) A transferee who acquires special declarant rights pursuant to subsection (b) and who is not
an affiliate of the transferor may record an instrument in compliance with subsection (b) stating that
the transferee elects to acquire the special declarant rights solely for subsequent retransfer to another
person who acquires title to units or additional real estate from said transferee. In that case, (i) the
transferee may not utilize special declarant rights in the sale of units or otherwise sell units, except
to a person who also acquires one or more special declarant rights the transferee holds with respect
to the units or additional real estate sold; (ii) the transferee may not exercise any special declarant
rights other than the rights described in section 515B.1-103(33)(v); (iii) the transferee is not liable
to make up any operating deficit under section 515B.3-115(a)(2); and (iv) the transferee is liable
as a declarant only for the obligations of a declarant under sections 515B.3-103, 515B.3-111, and
3168                                                          JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                                          [62ND DAY

515B.3-120, as applicable. A transferee who makes the election described in this subsection may
subsequently rescind the election in whole or in part by recording an instrument in compliance with
applicable law, and upon the recording of such an instrument the transferee's rights and obligations
as a declarant shall be as otherwise set forth in this section.
   (i) Nothing in this section shall subject any transferee of a special declarant right to any claims
against or other obligations of a transferor, other than claims and obligations arising under this
chapter, or the declaration or bylaws.
    (j) A special declarant right held by a declarant terminates upon the earlier of: (i) that declarant's
voluntary surrender of the special declarant right by giving written notice to the unit owners pursuant
to section 515B.1-115; or (ii) the conveyance, whether voluntary or involuntary, by that declarant,
of all of the units and additional real estate owned by that declarant, unless immediately after the
conveyance the special declarant right is transferred to the grantee. All special declarant rights
terminate ten years after the date of the first conveyance of a unit to a person other than a declarant
unless extended by the vote or written agreement of unit owners entitled to cast at least 67 percent
of the votes allocated to units not owned by a declarant.
    (k) No person shall exercise special declarant rights unless, at the time of exercise, the person
holds title of record to one or more units or additional real estate. Any exercise of a special declarant
right in violation of this section shall be void, and the person attempting to exercise the right shall
be liable for all damages and costs arising from its actions.
    (l) Subsections (a) through (i) of this section apply only to transfers of special declarant rights
that are effective on or after August 1, 2010. Subsections (j) and (k) of this section apply only to
special declarant rights reserved in a declaration that is first recorded on or after August 1, 2010.

    (a) The annual budgets of the association shall provide from year to year, on a cumulative
basis, for adequate reserve funds to cover the replacement of those parts of the common interest
community which the association is obligated to replace. These reserve requirements shall not apply
to a common interest community which is restricted to nonresidential use.
    (b) Unless the declaration provides otherwise, any surplus funds that the association has
remaining after payment of or provision for common expenses and reserves shall be (i) credited to
the unit owners to reduce their future common expense assessments or (ii) credited to reserves, or
any combination thereof, as determined by the board of directors.

    Sec. 15. [515B.3-1141] REPLACEMENT RESERVES.
    (a) The association shall include in its annual budgets replacement reserves projected by the
board to be adequate, together with past and future contributions to replacement reserves, to fund
the replacement of those components of the common interest community which the association is
obligated to replace by reason of ordinary wear and tear or obsolescence, subject to the following:
    (1) The amount annually budgeted for replacement reserves shall be adequate, together with past
and future contributions to replacement reserves, to replace the components as determined based
upon the estimated remaining useful life of each component; provided that portions of replacement
reserves need not be segregated for the replacement of specific components.
    (2) Unless otherwise required by the declaration, annual budgets need not include reserves for the
replacement of (i) components that a remaining useful life of more than 30 years, or (ii) components
whose replacement will be funded by assessments authorized under section 515B.3-1151(e)(1), or
approved in compliance with clause (5).
    (3) The association shall keep the replacement reserves in an account or accounts separate from
the association's operating funds, and shall not use or borrow from the replacement reserves to fund
the association's operating expenses, provided that this restriction shall not affect the association's
authority to pledge the replacement reserves as security for a loan to the association.
   (4) The association shall reevaluate the adequacy of its budgeted replacement reserves at least
every third year after the recording of the declaration creating the common interest community.
    (5) Unless otherwise required by the declaration, after the termination of the period of declarant
control, and subject to approval by (i) the board, and (ii) unit owners, other than the declarant or its
affiliates, of units to which 51 percent of the votes in the association are allocated, the association
need not annually assess for replacement reserves to replace those components whose replacement
is planned to be paid for by special assessments, if the declaration authorizes special assessments, or
by assessments levied under section 515B.3-1151(e)(2). The approval provided for in the preceding
sentence shall be effective for no more than the association's current and three following fiscal years,
subject to modification or renewal by the same approval standards.

utilities may be assessed in proportion to usage;
    (4) reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred by the association in connection with (i) the

    (f) Assessments levied under section 515B.3-116 to pay a judgment against the association may
be levied only against the units in the common interest community at the time the judgment was
entered, in proportion to their common expense liabilities.
    (g) If any damage to the common elements or another unit is caused by the act or omission of any
unit owner, or occupant of a unit, or their invitees, the association may assess the costs of repairing
the damage exclusively against the unit owner's unit to the extent not covered by insurance.
    (h) Subject to any shorter period specified by the declaration or bylaws, if any installment of an
assessment becomes more than 60 days past due, then the association may, upon ten days' written
notice to the unit owner, declare the entire amount of the assessment immediately due and payable
in full.
   (i) If common expense liabilities are reallocated for any purpose authorized by this chapter,
common expense assessments and any installment thereof not yet due shall be recalculated in
accordance with the reallocated common expense liabilities.
   (j) An assessment against fewer than all of the units must be levied within three years after the
event or circumstances forming the basis for the assessment, or shall be barred.

   Sec. 17. [515B.3-1151] ASSESSMENTS FOR COMMON EXPENSES.
    (a) The association shall approve an annual budget of common expenses at or prior to the
conveyance of the first unit in the common interest community to a purchaser and annually
thereafter. The annual budget shall include all customary and necessary operating expenses and
replacement reserves for the common interest community, consistent with this section and section
515B.3-114. For purposes of replacement reserves under subsection (b), until an annual budget
has been approved, the reserves shall be paid based upon the budget contained in the disclosure
statement required by section 515B.4-102. The obligation of a unit owner to pay common expenses
shall be as follows:
    (1) If a common expense assessment has not been levied by the association, the declarant
shall pay all common expenses of the common interest community, including the payment of
the replacement reserve component of the common expenses for all units in compliance with
subsection (b).
    (2) If a common expense assessment has been levied by the association, all unit owners,
including the declarant, shall pay the assessments levied against their units, except as follows:
    (i) The declaration may provide for an alternate common expense plan whereby the declarant's
common expense liability, and the corresponding assessment lien against the units owned by the
declarant, is limited to: (A) paying when due, in compliance with subsection (b), an amount equal
to the full share of the replacement reserves allocated to units owned by the declarant, as set forth
in the association's annual budget approved as provided in this subsection; and (B) paying when
due all accrued expenses of the common interest community in excess of the aggregate assessments
payable with respect to units owned by persons other than a declarant; provided, that the alternate
common expense plan shall not affect a declarant's obligation to make up any operating deficit

pursuant to item (iv), and shall terminate upon the termination of any period of declarant control
unless terminated earlier pursuant to item (iii).
    (ii) The alternate common expense plan may be authorized only by including in the declaration
and the disclosure statement required by section 515B.4-102 provisions authorizing and disclosing
the alternate common expense plan as described in item (i), and including in the disclosure statement
either (A) a statement that the alternate common expense plan will have no effect on the level of
services or amenities anticipated by the association's budget contained in the disclosure statement,
or (B) a statement describing how the services or amenities may be affected.
     (iii) A declarant shall give notice to the association of its intent to utilize the alternate common
expense plan and a commencement date after the date the notice is given. The alternate common
expense plan shall be valid only for periods after the notice is given. A declarant may terminate
its right to utilize the alternative common expense plan prior to the termination of the period of
declarant control only by giving notice to the association and the unit owners at least 30 days prior
to a selected termination date set forth in the notice.
    (iv) If a declarant utilizes an alternate common expense plan, that declarant shall cause to
be prepared and delivered to the association, at the declarant's expense, within 90 days after the
termination of the period of declarant control, an audited balance sheet and profit and loss statement
certified to the association and prepared by an accountant having the qualifications set forth in
section 515B.3-121(b). The audit shall be binding on the declarant and the association.
    (v) If the audited profit and loss statement shows an accumulated operating deficit, the declarant
shall be obligated to make up the deficit within 15 days after delivery of the audit to the association,
and the association shall have a claim against the declarant for an amount equal to the deficit until
paid. A declarant who does not utilize an alternate common expense plan is not liable to make up
any operating deficit. If more than one declarant utilizes an alternate common expense plan, all
declarants who utilize the plan are jointly and severally liable to the association for any operating
deficit.
    (vi) The existence and amount, if any, of the operating deficit shall be determined using the
accrual method of accounting applied as of the date of termination of the period of declarant
control, regardless of the accounting methodology previously used by the association to maintain
its accounts.
    (vii) Unless approved by a vote of the unit owners other than the declarant and its affiliates, the
operating deficit shall not be made up, prior to the election by the unit owners of a board of directors
pursuant to section 515B.3-103(d), through the use of a special assessment described in subsection
(c) or by assessments described in subsections (e), (f), and (g).
    (viii) The use by a declarant of an alternate common expense plan shall not affect the obligations
of the declarant or the association as provided in the declaration, the bylaws, or this chapter, or
as represented in the disclosure statement required by section 515B.4-102, except as to matters
authorized by this chapter.
   (b) The replacement reserves required by section 515B.3-114 shall be paid to the association
by each unit owner for each unit owned by that unit owner in accordance with the association's
annual budget approved pursuant to subsection (a), regardless of whether an annual assessment has
been levied or whether the declarant has utilized an alternate common expense plan under subsection
3178                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [62ND DAY

(a)(2). Replacement reserves shall be paid with respect to a unit commencing as of the later of (1) the
date of creation of the common interest community or (2) the date that the structure and exterior of
the building containing the unit, or the structure and exterior of any building located within the unit
boundaries, but excluding the interior finishing of the structure itself, are substantially completed.
If the association has not approved an annual budget as of the commencement date for the payment
of replacement reserves, then the reserves shall be paid based upon the budget contained in the
disclosure statement required by section 515B.4-102.
    (c) After an assessment has been levied by the association, assessments shall be levied at least
annually, based upon an annual budget approved by the association. In addition to and not in lieu of
annual assessments, an association may, if so provided in the declaration, levy special assessments
against all units in the common interest community based upon the same formula required by the
declaration for levying annual assessments. Special assessments may be levied only (1) to cover
expenditures of an emergency nature, (2) to replenish underfunded replacement reserves, (3) to
cover unbudgeted capital expenditures or operating expenses, or (4) to replace certain components
of the common interest community described in section 515B.3-114(a), if such alternative method
of funding is approved under section 515B.3-114(a)(5). The association may also levy assessments
against fewer than all units as provided in subsections (e), (f), and (g). An assessment under
section 515B.3-1151(e)(2) for replacement reserves is subject to the requirements of section
515B.3-1141(a)(5).
   (d) Except as modified by subsections (a), clauses (1) and (2), (e), (f), and (g), all common
expenses shall be assessed against all the units in accordance with the allocations established by the
declaration pursuant to section 515B.2-108.
   (e) Unless otherwise required by the declaration:
    (1) any common expense associated with the maintenance, repair, or replacement of a limited
common element shall be assessed against the units to which that limited common element is
assigned, equally, or in any other proportion the declaration provides;
   (2) any common expense or portion thereof benefiting fewer than all of the units may be assessed
exclusively against the units benefited, equally, or in any other proportion the declaration provides;
    (3) the costs of insurance may be assessed in proportion to risk or coverage, and the costs of
utilities may be assessed in proportion to usage;
    (4) reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred by the association in connection with (i) the
collection of assessments, and (ii) the enforcement of this chapter, the articles, bylaws, declaration,
or rules and regulations, against a unit owner, may be assessed against the unit owner's unit; and
   (5) fees, charges, late charges, fines, and interest may be assessed as provided in section
515B.3-116(a).
    (f) Assessments levied under section 515B.3-116 to pay a judgment against the association may
be levied only against the units in the common interest community at the time the judgment was
entered, in proportion to their common expense liabilities.
    (g) If any damage to the common elements or another unit is caused by the act or omission of any
unit owner, or occupant of a unit, or their invitees, the association may assess the costs of repairing
the damage exclusively against the unit owner's unit to the extent not covered by insurance.

    (h) Subject to any shorter period specified by the declaration or bylaws, if any installment of an
assessment becomes more than 60 days past due, then the association may, upon ten days' written
notice to the unit owner, declare the entire amount of the assessment immediately due and payable
in full.
   (i) If common expense liabilities are reallocated for any purpose authorized by this chapter,
common expense assessments and any installment thereof not yet due shall be recalculated in
accordance with the reallocated common expense liabilities.
   (j) An assessment against fewer than all of the units must be levied within three years after the
event or circumstances forming the basis for the assessment, or shall be barred.
      (k) This section applies only to common interest communities created on or after August 1, 2010.

as approved pursuant to section 515B.3-114(a). If, based upon the association's then-current budget,
the monthly common expense assessment for the unit at the time of conveyance to the purchaser is
anticipated to exceed the monthly assessment stated in the budget, a statement to such effect shall
be included.
    (b) A declarant shall promptly amend the disclosure statement to reflect any material change in
the information required by this chapter.
    (c) The master association, within ten days after a request by a declarant, a holder of declarant
rights, or a buyer referred to in section 515B.4-101(e), or the authorized representative of any of
them, shall furnish the information required to be provided by subsection (a)(20). A declarant or
other person who provides information pursuant to subsection (a)(20), is not liable to the buyer
for any erroneous information if the declarant or other person: (i) is not an affiliate of or related
in any way to a person authorized to appoint the master association board pursuant to section
515B.2-121(c)(3), and (ii) has no actual knowledge that the information is incorrect.
     (d) This section applies only to common interest communities created on or after August 1, 2010.

materials, and strategies to appropriately meet the needs of individual students and ensure adequate
progress toward the state's graduation rule.
    (l) In adopting rules to license public school teachers who provide health-related services for

and other staff development opportunities and days on which a teacher is absent from school must
not be included in determining the number of school days on which a teacher performs services.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), during the probationary period any annual contract
with any teacher may or may not be renewed as the school board shall see fit. However, the board
must give any such teacher whose contract it declines to renew for the following school year
written notice to that effect before ­               Ju

of a teaching contract, the board must give the teacher its reason in writing, including a statement
that appropriate supervision was furnished describing the nature and the extent of such supervision
furnished the teacher during the employment by the board, within ten days after receiving such
request. The school board may, after a hearing held upon due notice, discharge a teacher during the
probationary period for cause, effective immediately, under section 122A.44.
    (b) A board must discharge a probationary teacher, effective immediately, upon receipt of notice
under section 122A.20, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), that the teacher's license has been revoked due
to a conviction for child abuse or sexual abuse.

interrupted for active military service and who promptly resumes teaching consistent with federal
reemployment timelines for uniformed service personnel under United States Code, title 38, section

     Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.40, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 8a. Probationary period for principals hired internally. A probationary period of
two school years is required for a licensed teacher employed by the board who is subsequently
employed by the board as a licensed school principal or assistant principal and an additional
probationary period of two years is required for a licensed assistant principal employed by the

board who is subsequently employed by the board as a licensed principal. A licensed teacher
subsequently employed by the board as a licensed school principal or assistant principal retains the
teacher's continuing contract status as a licensed teacher during the probationary period under this
subdivision and has the right to return to his or her previous position or an equivalent position, if
available, if the teacher is not promoted.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective June 30, 2011, and applies to all contracts for
internally hired licensed school principals and assistant principals ratified or modified after that date.
    Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.40, subdivision 11, is amended to read:
    Subd. 11. Unrequested leave of absence. (a) The board may place on unrequested leave
of absence, without pay or fringe benefits, as many teachers as may be necessary because of
discontinuance of position, lack of pupils, financial limitations, or merger of classes caused by
consolidation of districts. The unrequested leave is effective at the close of the school year. In
placing teachers on unrequested leave, the board may exempt from the effects of paragraphs (b) to
(g) those teachers who teach in a Montessori or a language immersion program, provide instruction
in an advanced placement course, or hold a kindergarten through grade 12 instrumental vocal
classroom music license and currently serve as a choir, band or orchestra director and who, in
the superintendent's judgment, meet a unique need in delivering curriculum. However, within the
Montessori or language immersion program, a teacher must be placed on unrequested leave of

providing otherwise.
   (b) The board may exempt from the effects of paragraph (a) those teachers who teach in a
Montessori or a language immersion program or provide instruction in an advanced placement
course and who, in the superintendent's judgment, meet a unique need in delivering curriculum.
However, within the Montessori or language immersion program, a teacher shall be discontinued

seniority when that exercise results in that teacher being retained by the district in a field for which
the teacher holds only a provisional license, as defined by the Board of Teaching, unless that exercise
of seniority results in the termination of services, on account of discontinuance of position or lack
of pupils, of another teacher who also holds a provisional license in the same field. The provisions
of this clause do not apply to vocational education licenses.

reinstatement.

    Subdivision 1. Contract; duties. All districts maintaining a classified secondary school must
employ a superintendent who shall be an ex officio nonvoting member of the school board. The
authority for selection and employment of a superintendent must be vested in the board in all cases.
An individual employed by a board as a superintendent shall have an initial employment contract
for a period of time no longer than three years from the date of employment. Any subsequent

employment contract must not exceed a period of three years. A board, at its discretion, may or may
not renew an employment contract. A board must not, by action or inaction, extend the duration
of an existing employment contract. Beginning 365 days prior to the expiration date of an existing
employment contract, a board may negotiate and enter into a subsequent employment contract to
take effect upon the expiration of the existing contract. A subsequent contract must be contingent
upon the employee completing the terms of an existing contract. If a contract between a board and a
superintendent is terminated prior to the date specified in the contract, the board may not enter into
another superintendent contract with that same individual that has a term that extends beyond the
date specified in the terminated contract. A board may terminate a superintendent during the term
of an employment contract for any of the grounds specified in section 122A.40, subdivision 9 or
13. A superintendent shall not rely upon an employment contract with a board to assert any other
continuing contract rights in the position of superintendent under section 122A.40. Notwithstanding
the provisions of sections 122A.40, subdivision 10 or 11, 123A.32, 123A.75, or any other law to
the contrary, no individual shall have a right to employment as a superintendent based on order of
employment in any district. If two or more districts enter into an agreement for the purchase or
sharing of the services of a superintendent, the contracting districts have the absolute right to select
one of the individuals employed to serve as superintendent in one of the contracting districts and
no individual has a right to employment as the superintendent to provide all or part of the services
based on order of employment in a contracting district. The superintendent of a district shall perform
the following:
   (1) visit and supervise the schools in the district, report and make recommendations about their
condition when advisable or on request by the board;
   (2) recommend to the board employment and dismissal of teachers;
    (3) annually evaluate each school principal assigned responsibility for supervising a school
building within the district, consistent with section 123B.147, subdivision 3, paragraph (b);
   (4) superintend school grading practices and examinations for promotions;
   ­

    (b) To enhance a principal's leadership skills and support and improve teaching practices, school
performance, and student achievement, a district must develop and implement a performance-based
system for annually evaluating school principals assigned to supervise a school building within
the district. The evaluation must be designed to improve teaching and learning by supporting
the principal in shaping the school's professional environment and developing teacher quality,
performance, and effectiveness. The annual evaluation must:

   (1) support and improve a principal's instructional leadership, organizational management,
and professional development, and strengthen the principal's capacity in the areas of instruction,
supervision, evaluation, and teacher development;
     (2) include formative and summative evaluations;
    (3) be consistent with a principal's job description, a district's long-term plans and goals, and
the principal's own professional multiyear growth plans and goals, all of which must support
the principal's leadership behaviors and practices, rigorous curriculum, school performance, and
high-quality instruction;
     (4) include on-the-job observations and previous evaluations;
    (5) allow surveys to help identify a principal's effectiveness, leadership skills and processes, and
strengths and weaknesses in exercising leadership in pursuit of school success;
   (6) use longitudinal data on student academic growth as an evaluation component and
incorporate district achievement goals and targets; and
    (7) be linked to professional development that emphasizes improved teaching and learning,
curriculum and instruction, student learning, and a collaborative professional culture.
   The provisions of this paragraph are intended to provide districts with sufficient flexibility to
accommodate district needs and goals related to developing, supporting, and evaluating principals.

replace the school the board decided to close. Applicants seeking a charter under this circumstance
must demonstrate to the authorizer that the charter sought is substantially different in purpose and
program from the school the board closed and that the proposed charter satisfies the requirements of
this subdivision. If the school board that closed the school authorizes the charter, it must document
in its affidavit to the commissioner that the charter is substantially different in program and purpose
from the school it closed.
   An authorizer shall not approve an application submitted by a charter school developer
under subdivision 4, paragraph (a), if the application does not comply with this subdivision. The
commissioner shall not approve an affidavit submitted by an authorizer under subdivision 4,
paragraph (b), if the affidavit does not comply with this subdivision.
    Subd. 2. Applicability. This section applies only to charter schools formed and operated under
this section.
    Subd. 3. Authorizer. (a) For purposes of this section, the terms defined in this subdivision have
the meanings given them.
    "Application" to receive approval as an authorizer means the proposal an eligible authorizer
submits to the commissioner under paragraph (c) before that authorizer is able to submit any affidavit
to charter to a school.
   "Application" under subdivision 4 means the charter school business plan a school developer
submits to an authorizer for approval to establish a charter school that documents the school
developer's mission statement, school purposes, program design, financial plan, governance and
management structure, and background and experience, plus any other information the authorizer
requests. The application also shall include a "statement of assurances" of legal compliance
prescribed by the commissioner.
    "Affidavit" means a written statement the authorizer submits to the commissioner for approval
to establish a charter school under subdivision 4 attesting to its review and approval process before
chartering a school.

                            e single-purpose authorizers that are charitable, nonsectarian organizations
formed under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and incorporated in the
state of Minnesota whose sole purpose is to charter schools. Eligible organizations interested in
being approved as an authorizer under this paragraph must submit a proposal to the commissioner
that includes the provisions of paragraph (c) and a five-year financial plan. Such authorizers shall
consider and approve applications using the criteria provided in subdivision 4 and shall not limit
the applications it solicits, considers, or approves to any single curriculum, learning program, or
method.
     (c) An eligible authorizer under this subdivision must apply to the commissioner for approval as
an authorizer before submitting any affidavit to the commissioner to charter a school. The application
for approval as a charter school authorizer must demonstrate the applicant's ability to implement
the procedures and satisfy the criteria for chartering a school under this section. The commissioner
must approve or disapprove an application within ­    60
                                                       ­ 45 business days of the application deadline.
If the commissioner disapproves the application, the commissioner must notify the applicant of the
specific deficiencies in writing and the applicant then has 20 business days to address the deficiencies
to the commissioner's satisfaction. After the 20 business days expire, the commissioner has 15
business days to make a final decision to approve or disapprove the application. Failing to address
the deficiencies to the commissioner's satisfaction makes an applicant ineligible to be an authorizer.
The commissioner, in establishing criteria for approval, must consider the applicant's:
    (1) capacity and infrastructure;
    (2) application criteria and process;
    (3) contracting process;
    (4) ongoing oversight and evaluation processes; and
    (5) renewal criteria and processes.

and form determined by the commissioner and may review an authorizer's performance more
frequently at the commissioner's own initiative or at the request of a charter school operator,
charter school board member, or other interested party. The commissioner, after completing the
review, shall transmit a report with findings to the authorizer. If, consistent with this section,
the commissioner finds that an authorizer has not fulfilled the requirements of this section, the
commissioner may subject the authorizer to corrective action, which may include terminating the
contract with the charter school board of directors of a school it chartered. The commissioner
must notify the authorizer in writing of any findings that may subject the authorizer to corrective
action and the authorizer then has 15 business days to request an informal hearing before the
commissioner takes corrective action. If the commissioner terminates a contract between an
authorizer and a charter school under this paragraph, the commissioner may assist the charter
school in acquiring a new authorizer.
   ­(h

terminating an authorizer's ability to charter a school for:
   (1) failing to demonstrate the criteria under paragraph (c) under which the commissioner
approved the authorizer;
    (2) violating a term of the chartering contract between the authorizer and the charter school board
of directors; ­o­

   (3) unsatisfactory performance as an approved authorizer; or
    (4) any good cause shown that provides the commissioner a legally sufficient reason to take
corrective action against an authorizer.
    Subd. 4. Formation of school. (a) An authorizer, after receiving an application from a school

apply to the school except as provided in this section.
    Notwithstanding sections 465.717 and 465.719, a school district, subject to this section and
section 124D.11, may create a corporation for the purpose of establishing a charter school.
    (b) Before the operators may establish and operate a school, the authorizer must file an affidavit
with the commissioner stating its intent to charter a school. An authorizer must file a separate
affidavit for each school it intends to charter. The affidavit must state the terms and conditions
under which the authorizer would charter a school and how the authorizer intends to oversee the
fiscal and student performance of the charter school and to comply with the terms of the written
contract between the authorizer and the charter school board of directors under subdivision 6.
The commissioner must approve or disapprove the authorizer's affidavit within 60 business days

of receipt of the affidavit. If the commissioner disapproves the affidavit, the commissioner shall
notify the authorizer of the deficiencies in the affidavit and the authorizer then has 20 business days
to address the deficiencies. If the authorizer does not address deficiencies to the commissioner's
satisfaction, the commissioner's disapproval is final. Failure to obtain commissioner approval
precludes an authorizer from chartering the school that is the subject of this affidavit.
    (c) The authorizer may prevent an approved charter school from opening for operation if, among
other grounds, the charter school violates this section or does not meet the ready-to-open standards
that are part of the authorizer's oversight and evaluation process or are stipulated in the charter
school contract.

or other agreement for professional or other services, goods, or facilities, must incorporate as

cooperative; and
   (2) with the authorizer's approval.
   Any change in board governance must conform with the board structure established under this

    (i) The granting or renewal of a charter school by an authorizer must not be contingent on
the charter school being required to contract, lease, or purchase services from the authorizer.
Any potential contract, lease, or purchase of service from an authorizer must be disclosed to the
commissioner, accepted through an open bidding process, and be a separate contract from the
charter contract. The school must document the open bidding process. An authorizer must not enter
into a contract to provide management and financial services for a school that it authorizes, unless
the school documents that it received at least two competitive bids.
    (j) An authorizer may permit the board of directors of a charter school to expand the operation
of the charter school to additional sites or to add additional grades at the school beyond those
described in the authorizer's original affidavit as approved by the commissioner only after submitting

approval or disapproval of a supplemental affidavit is final.
    Subd. 4a. Conflict of interest. (a) An individual is prohibited from serving as a member of the
charter school board of directors if the individual, an immediate family member, or the individual's
partner is an owner, employee or agent of, or a contractor with a for-profit or nonprofit entity or
individual with whom the charter school contracts, directly or indirectly, for professional services,
goods, or facilities. A violation of this prohibition renders a contract voidable at the option of the
commissioner or the charter school board of directors. A member of a charter school board of
directors who violates this prohibition is individually liable to the charter school for any damage
caused by the violation.
    (b) No member of the board of directors, employee, officer, or agent of a charter school shall
participate in selecting, awarding, or administering a contract if a conflict of interest exists. A conflict
exists when:
   (1) the board member, employee, officer, or agent;
   (2) the immediate family of the board member, employee, officer, or agent;
   (3) the partner of the board member, employee, officer, or agent; or
   (4) an organization that employs, or is about to employ any individual in clauses (1) to (3),
has a financial or other interest in the entity with which the charter school is contracting. A violation
of this prohibition renders the contract void.
     (c) Any employee, agent, or board member of the authorizer who participates in the initial review,
approval, ongoing oversight, evaluation, or the charter renewal or nonrenewal process or decision
is ineligible to serve on the board of directors of a school chartered by that authorizer.
   (d) An individual may serve as a member of the board of directors if no conflict of interest under
paragraph (a) exists.
    (e) The conflict of interest provisions under this subdivision do not apply to compensation paid
to a teacher employed by the charter school who also serves as a member of the board of directors.
    (f) The conflict of interest provisions under this subdivision do not apply to a teacher who
provides services to a charter school through a cooperative formed under chapter 308A when the
teacher also serves on the charter school board of directors.
    Subd. 5. Conversion of existing schools. A board of an independent or special school district
may convert one or more of its existing schools to charter schools under this section if 60 percent of
the full-time teachers at the school sign a petition seeking conversion. The conversion must occur
at the beginning of an academic year.
    Subd. 6. Charter contract. The authorization for a charter school must be in the form of a written
contract signed by the authorizer and the board of directors of the charter school. The contract must
be completed within 45 business days of the commissioner's approval of the authorizer's affidavit.
The authorizer shall submit to the commissioner a copy of the signed charter contract within ten
business days of its execution. The contract for a charter school must be in writing and contain at
least the following:

subdivision 3, paragraph (e).
    (b) An authorizer shall monitor and evaluate the fiscal, operational, and student performance of

transportation or use the transportation services of the district in which it is located for the fiscal
year.
   (b) If a charter school elects to provide transportation for pupils, the transportation must be
provided by the charter school within the district in which the charter school is located. The state
must pay transportation aid to the charter school according to section 124D.11, subdivision 2.
    For pupils who reside outside the district in which the charter school is located, the charter school
is not required to provide or pay for transportation between the pupil's residence and the border of

for costs of transportation from the pupil's residence to the border of the district in which the charter
school is located if the pupil is from a family whose income is at or below the poverty level, as
3222                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [62ND DAY

determined by the federal government. The reimbursement may not exceed the pupil's actual cost
of transportation or 15 cents per mile traveled, whichever is less. Reimbursement may not be paid

which the charter school is located. Transportation may be provided by the district in which the
school is located, according to sections 123B.88, subdivision 6, and 124D.03, subdivision 8, for
a pupil residing in a different district. If the district provides the transportation, the scheduling of
routes, manner and method of transportation, control and discipline of the pupils, and any other
matter relating to the transportation of pupils under this paragraph shall be within the sole discretion,
control, and management of the district.
    Subd. 17. Leased space. A charter school may lease space from an independent or special
school board eligible to be an authorizer, other public organization, private, nonprofit nonsectarian
organization, private property owner, or a sectarian organization if the leased space is constructed as
a school facility. The department must review and approve or disapprove leases in a timely manner.
    Subd. 17a. Affiliated nonprofit building corporation. (a) Before a charter school may organize
an affiliated nonprofit building corporation (i) to renovate or purchase an existing facility to serve

corporation that does not own the leased facility is ineligible to receive charter school lease aid. The
state is immune from liability resulting from a contract between a charter school and an affiliated
nonprofit building corporation.
   (c) A charter school may organize an affiliated nonprofit building corporation to renovate or
purchase an existing facility to serve as a school if the charter school:

    Subd. 19. Disseminate information. (a) The authorizer, the operators, and the department must
disseminate information to the public on how to form and operate a charter school. Charter schools
must disseminate information about how to use the offerings of a charter school. Targeted groups
include low-income families and communities, students of color, and students who are at risk of
academic failure.
   (b) Authorizers, operators, and the department also may disseminate information about the
successful best practices in teaching and learning demonstrated by charter schools.
    Subd. 20. Leave to teach in a charter school. If a teacher employed by a district makes a written
request for an extended leave of absence to teach at a charter school, the district must grant the leave.
The district must grant a leave not to exceed a total of five years. Any request to extend the leave shall
be granted only at the discretion of the school board. The district may require that the request for a
leave or extension of leave be made before February 1 in the school year preceding the school year
in which the teacher intends to leave, or February 1 of the calendar year in which the teacher's leave
is scheduled to terminate. Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision and except for section
122A.46, subdivision 7, the leave is governed by section 122A.46, including, but not limited to,
reinstatement, notice of intention to return, seniority, salary, and insurance.
   During a leave, the teacher may continue to aggregate benefits and credits in the Teachers'
Retirement Association account under chapters 354 and 354A, consistent with subdivision 22.
    Subd. 21. Collective bargaining. Employees of the board of directors of a charter school may,
if otherwise eligible, organize under chapter 179A and comply with its provisions. The board of
directors of a charter school is a public employer, for the purposes of chapter 179A, upon formation
of one or more bargaining units at the school. Bargaining units at the school must be separate from

any other units within an authorizing district, except that bargaining units may remain part of the
appropriate unit within an authorizing district, if the employees of the school, the board of directors
of the school, the exclusive representative of the appropriate unit in the authorizing district, and
the board of the authorizing district agree to include the employees in the appropriate unit of the
authorizing district.
   Subd. 22. Teacher and other employee retirement. (a) Teachers in a charter school must be
public school teachers for the purposes of chapters 354 and 354a.
  (b) Except for teachers under paragraph (a), employees in a charter school must be public
employees for the purposes of chapter 353.
     Subd. 23. Causes for nonrenewal or termination of charter school contract. (a) The duration
of the contract with an authorizer must be for the term contained in the contract according to
subdivision 6. The authorizer may or may not renew a contract at the end of the term for any ground
listed in paragraph (b). An authorizer may unilaterally terminate a contract during the term of the
contract for any ground listed in paragraph (b). At least 60 business days before not renewing or
terminating a contract, the authorizer shall notify the board of directors of the charter school of the
proposed action in writing. The notice shall state the grounds for the proposed action in reasonable
detail and that the charter school's board of directors may request in writing an informal hearing
before the authorizer within 15 business days of receiving notice of nonrenewal or termination
of the contract. Failure by the board of directors to make a written request for ­      a an informal
hearing within the 15-business-day period shall be treated as acquiescence to the proposed action.
Upon receiving a timely written request for a hearing, the authorizer shall give ten business days'
notice to the charter school's board of directors of the hearing date. The authorizer shall conduct
an informal hearing before taking final action. The authorizer shall take final action to renew or
not renew a contract no later than 20 business days before the proposed date for terminating the
contract or the end date of the contract.
     (b) A contract may be terminated or not renewed upon any of the following grounds:
     (1) failure to meet the requirements for pupil performance contained in the contract;
     (2) failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal management;
     (3) violations of law; or
     (4) other good cause shown.
   If a contract is terminated or not renewed under this paragraph, the school must be dissolved
according to the applicable provisions of chapter 3

    Subd. 7. Performance tracking system. (a) By July 1, 2000, each approved adult basic
education program must develop and implement a performance tracking system to provide
information necessary to comply with federal law and serve as one means of assessing the
effectiveness of adult basic education programs. For required reporting, longitudinal studies, and
program improvement, the tracking system must be designed to collect data on the following core
outcomes for learners who have completed p  ­­

program:
   (1) demonstrated improvements in literacy skill levels in reading, writing, speaking the English
language, numeracy, problem solving, English language acquisition, and other literacy skills;
  (2) placement in, retention in, or completion of postsecondary education, training, unsubsidized
employment, or career advancement; ­   an

   (4) reduction in participation in the diversionary work program, Minnesota family investment
program, and food support education and training program.
   (b) A district, group of districts, state agency, or private nonprofit organization providing an
adult basic education program may meet this requirement by developing a tracking system based
on either or both of the following methodologies:
    (1) conducting a reliable follow-up survey; or
    (2) submitting student information, including Social Security numbers for data matching.
    Data related to obtaining employment must be collected in the first quarter following program
completion or can be collected while the student is enrolled, if known. Data related to employment
retention must be collected in the third quarter following program exit. Data related to any other
specified outcome may be collected at any time during a program year.
    (c) When a student in a program is requested to provide the student's Social Security number,
the student must be notified in a written form easily understandable to the student that:
    (1) providing the Social Security number is optional and no adverse action may be taken against
the student if the student chooses not to provide the Social Security number;
    (2) the request is made under section 124D.52, subdivision 7;
    (3) if the student provides the Social Security number, it will be used to assess the effectiveness
of the program by tracking the student's subsequent career; and
     (4) the Social Security number will be shared with the Department of Education; Minnesota
State Colleges and Universities; Office of Higher Education; Department of Human Services; and

               ­n
any other governmental entities.
    (d) Annually a district, group of districts, state agency, or private nonprofit organization
providing programs under this section must forward the tracking data collected to the Department
of Education. For the purposes of longitudinal studies on the employment status of former students
under this section, the Department of Education must forward the Social Security numbers to
the Department of Employment and Economic Development to electronically match the Social
Security numbers of former students with wage detail reports filed under section 268.044. The
results of data matches must, for purposes of this section and consistent with the requirements
of the United States Code, title 29, section 2871, of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, be
compiled in a longitudinal form by the Department of Employment and Economic Development
and released to the Department of Education in the form of summary data that does not identify the
individual students. The Department of Education may release this summary data. State funding
for adult basic education programs must not be based on the number or percentage of students who
decline to provide their Social Security numbers or on whether the program is evaluated by means
of a follow-up survey instead of data matching.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies
through the 2020-2021 school year.

    Subd. 3. Early childhood literacy programs. (a) A research-based early childhood literacy
program premised on actively involved parents, ongoing professional staff development, and high
quality early literacy program standards is established to increase the literacy skills of children
participating in Head Start to prepare them to be successful readers and to increase families'
participation in providing early literacy experiences to their children. Program providers must:
   (1) work to prepare children to be successful learners;
   (2) work to close the achievement gap for at-risk children;
    (3) use an integrated approach to early literacy that daily offers a literacy-rich classroom
learning environment composed of books, writing materials, writing centers, labels, rhyming, and
other related literacy materials and opportunities;
     (4) support children's home language while helping the children master English and use multiple
literacy strategies to provide a cultural bridge between home and school;
    (5) use literacy mentors, ongoing literacy groups, and other teachers and staff to provide
appropriate, extensive professional development opportunities in early literacy and classroom
strategies for preschool teachers and other preschool staff;
   (6) use ongoing data-based assessments that enable preschool teachers to understand, plan, and
implement literacy strategies, activities, and curriculum that meet children's literacy needs and
continuously improve children's literacy; and
   (7) foster participation by parents, community stakeholders, literacy advisors, and evaluation
specialists.
Program providers are encouraged to collaborate with qualified, community-based early childhood
providers in implementing this program and to seek nonstate funds to supplement the program.
    (b) Program providers under paragraph (a) interested in extending literacy programs to children
in kindergarten through grade 3 may elect to form a partnership with an eligible organization under
section 124D.38, subdivision 2, or 124D.42, subdivision 6, clause (3), schools enrolling children
in kindergarten through grade 3, and other interested and qualified community-based entities to

implement a seamless literacy model from age three to grade 3, consistent with paragraph (a).
Literacy programs under this paragraph must collect and use literacy data to:
      (1) evaluate children's literacy skills; and
    (2) formulate specific intervention strategies to provide reading instruction to children premised
on the outcomes of formative and summative assessments and research-based indicators of literacy
development.
   The literacy programs under this paragraph also must train teachers and other providers working
with children to use the assessment outcomes under clause (2) to develop and use effective,
long-term literacy coaching models that are specific to the program providers.

      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 121A.17, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Screening program. (a) A screening program must include at least the following
components: developmental assessments, hearing and vision screening or referral, immunization
review and referral, the child's height and weight, identification of risk factors that may influence
learning, an interview with the parent about the child, and referral for assessment, diagnosis, and
treatment when potential needs are identified. The district and the person performing or supervising
the screening must provide a parent or guardian with clear written notice that the parent or guardian
may decline to answer questions or provide information about family circumstances that might
affect development and identification of risk factors that may influence learning. The notice must
state "Early childhood developmental screening helps a school district identify children who
may benefit from district and community resources available to help in their development. Early
childhood developmental screening includes a vision screening that helps detect potential eye
problems but is not a substitute for a comprehensive eye exam." The notice must clearly state that
declining to answer questions or provide information does not prevent the child from being enrolled
in kindergarten or first grade if all other screening components are met. If a parent or guardian
is not able to read and comprehend the written notice, the district and the person performing or
supervising the screening must convey the information in another manner. The notice must also
inform the parent or guardian that a child need not submit to the district screening program if the
child's health records indicate to the school that the child has received comparable developmental
screening performed within the preceding 365 days by a public or private health care organization
or individual health care provider. The notice must be given to a parent or guardian at the time the
district initially provides information to the parent or guardian about screening and must be given
again at the screening location.
    (b) All screening components shall be consistent with the standards of the state commissioner
of health for early developmental screening programs. A developmental screening program must
not provide laboratory tests or a physical examination to any child. The district must request from

the public or private health care organization or the individual health care provider the results of
any laboratory test or physical examination within the 12 months preceding a child's scheduled
screening.
   (c) If a child is without health coverage, the school district must refer the child to an appropriate
health care provider.
    (d) A board may offer additional components such as nutritional, physical and dental
assessments, review of family circumstances that might affect development, blood pressure,
laboratory tests, and health history.
   (e) If a statement signed by the child's parent or guardian is submitted to the administrator or
other person having general control and supervision of the school that the child has not been screened
because of conscientiously held beliefs of the parent or guardian, the screening is not required."
