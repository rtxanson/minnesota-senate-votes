   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 84.027, subdivision 14a, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 14a. Permitting efficiency. (a) It is the goal of the state that environmental and resource
management permits be issued or denied within 150 days of the submission of a substantially
completed permit application. The commissioner of natural resources shall establish management
systems designed to achieve the goal.
    (b) The commissioner shall prepare semiannual permitting efficiency reports that include
statistics on meeting the goal in paragraph (a). The reports are due February 1 and August 1
each year. For permit applications that have not met the goal, the report must state the reasons
for not meeting the goal, steps that will be taken to complete action on the application, and the
expected timeline. In stating the reasons for not meeting the goal, the commissioner shall separately
identify delays caused by the responsiveness of the proposer, lack of staff, scientific or technical
disagreements, or the level of public engagement. The report must specify the number of days from
initial submission of the application to the day of determination that the application is complete.
The report for August 1 each year must aggregate the data for the year and assess whether program
or system changes are necessary to achieve the goal. The report must be posted on the department's
Web site and submitted to the governor and the chairs and ranking minority members of the house
of representatives and senate committees having jurisdiction over natural resources policy and

application for a permit that is subject to a grant or loan agreement under chapter 446A.
     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 84.027, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
     Subd. 14b. Irrevocability or suspensions of permits. If, by July 1 of an odd-numbered year, a
biennial appropriation law has not been enacted for the department to fund programs to protect the
air, water, and land resources of the state, until the biennial appropriation law is enacted, permits
granted may not be terminated or suspended for the term of the permits, nor shall they expire or not be
renewed without the consent of the permittee, except for breach or nonperformance of any condition
of the permit by the permittee that is an imminent threat to impair or destroy the environment or
injure the health, safety, or welfare of the citizens of the state.
     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103G.291, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. Water supply plans; demand reduction. (a) Every public water supplier serving more
than 1,000 people must submit a water supply plan to the commissioner for approval by January 1,
1996. In accordance with guidelines developed by the commissioner, the plan must address projected
demands, adequacy of the water supply system and planned improvements, existing and future
water sources, natural resource impacts or limitations, emergency preparedness, water conservation,
supply and demand reduction measures, and allocation priorities that are consistent with section
103G.261. Public water suppliers must update their plan and, upon notification, submit it to the
commissioner for approval every ten years.
    (b) The water supply plan in paragraph (a) is required for all communities in the metropolitan
area, as defined in section 473.121, with a municipal water supply system and is a required element
of the local comprehensive plan required under section 473.859. Water supply plans or updates
submitted after December 31, 2008, must be consistent with the metropolitan area master water
supply plan required under section 473.1565, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2).
     (c) Public water suppliers serving more than 1,000 people must employ water use demand
reduction measures,        ­­n

    (d) Public water suppliers serving more than 1,000 people must submit records that indicate the
number of connections and amount of use by customer category and volume of water unaccounted
for with the annual report of water use required under section 103G.281, subdivision 3.
    (e) For the purposes of this section, "public water supplier" means an entity that owns, manages,
or operates a public water supply, as defined in section 144.382, subdivision 4.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 115.03, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 8b. Permit duration; state disposal system permits; animal feeding operations. State
disposal system permits that are issued without a national pollutant discharge elimination system
permit to animal feeding operations shall be issued for a term of ten years.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
     Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 116.03, subdivision 2b, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2b. Permitting efficiency. (a) It is the goal of the state that environmental and resource
management permits be issued or denied within 150 days of the submission of a substantially
completed permit application. The commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency shall establish
management systems designed to achieve the goal.
    (b) The commissioner shall prepare semiannual permitting efficiency reports that include
statistics on meeting the goal in paragraph (a). The reports are due February 1 and August 1
each year. For permit applications that have not met the goal, the report must state the reasons
for not meeting the goal, steps that will be taken to complete action on the application, and the
expected timeline. In stating the reasons for not meeting the goal, the commissioner shall separately
identify delays caused by the responsiveness of the proposer, lack of staff, scientific or technical
disagreements, or the level of public engagement. The report must specify the number of days from
initial submission of the application to the day of determination that the application is complete.
The report for August 1 each year must aggregate the data for the year and assess whether program
or system changes are necessary to achieve the goal. The report must be posted on the agency's
Web site and submitted to the governor and the chairs and ranking minority members of the house
of representatives and senate committees having jurisdiction over environment policy and finance.
   (c) The commissioner shall allow electronic submission of environmental review and permit
documents to the agency.
      (d) Beginning July 1, 2011, within 30 business days of application for a permit subject to
paragraph (a), the commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency shall notify the project proposer,
in writing, of w       ­h­­e­h

    Subd. 4a. Permits. (a) The Pollution Control Agency may issue, continue in effect or deny
permits, under such conditions as it may prescribe for the prevention of pollution, for the emission
of air contaminants, or for the installation or operation of any emission facility, air contaminant
treatment facility, treatment facility, potential air contaminant storage facility, or storage facility, or
any part thereof, or for the sources or emissions of noise pollution.
    The Pollution Control Agency may also issue, continue in effect or deny permits, under
such conditions as it may prescribe for the prevention of pollution, for the storage, collection,
transportation, processing, or disposal of waste, or for the installation or operation of any system or
facility, or any part thereof, related to the storage, collection, transportation, processing, or disposal
of waste.
    The agency may not issue a permit to a facility without analyzing and considering the cumulative
levels and effects of past and current environmental pollution from all sources on the environment
and residents of the geographic area within which the facility's emissions are likely to be deposited,
provided that the facility is located in a community in a city of the first class in Hennepin County

quality for sensitive populations between February 2007 and February 2008; and
   (5) is located near the junctions of several heavily trafficked state and county highways and two
one-way streets which carry both truck and auto traffic.
    The Pollution Control Agency may revoke or modify any permit issued under this subdivision
and section 116.081 whenever it is necessary, in the opinion of the agency, to prevent or abate
pollution.
    (b) The Pollution Control Agency has the authority for approval over the siting, expansion,
or operation of a solid waste facility with regard to environmental issues. However, the agency's
issuance of a permit does not release the permittee from any liability, penalty, or duty imposed by any
applicable county ordinances. Nothing in this chapter precludes, or shall be construed to preclude,
a county from enforcing land use controls, regulations, and ordinances existing at the time of the

   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 116D.04, subdivision 2a, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2a. When prepared. Where there is potential for significant environmental effects
resulting from any major governmental action, the action shall be preceded by a detailed
environmental impact statement prepared by the responsible governmental unit. The environmental
impact statement shall be an analytical rather than an encyclopedic document which describes the
proposed action in detail, analyzes its significant environmental impacts, discusses appropriate
alternatives to the proposed action and their impacts, and explores methods by which adverse
environmental impacts of an action could be mitigated. The environmental impact statement shall
also analyze those economic, employment and sociological effects that cannot be avoided should
the action be implemented. To ensure its use in the decision-making process, the environmental
impact statement shall be prepared as early as practical in the formulation of an action. No
mandatory environmental impact statement may be required for an ethanol plant, as defined in
section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), a biobutanol facility, as defined in section 41A.105,
subdivision 1a, clause (1), or a cellulosic biofuel facility, as defined in section 41A.10, subdivision
1, paragraph (d), that produces less than 125,000,000 gallons of ethanol, biobutanol, or cellulosic
biofuel annually and is located outside of the seven-county metropolitan area.
    (a) The board shall by rule establish categories of actions for which environmental impact
statements and for which environmental assessment worksheets shall be prepared as well as
categories of actions for which no environmental review is required under this section. A mandatory
environmental assessment worksheet shall not be required for the expansion of an ethanol plant,
as defined in section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), or the conversion of an ethanol plant
to a biobutanol facility or the expansion of a biobutanol facility as defined in section 41A.105,
subdivision 1a, based on the capacity of the expanded or converted facility to produce alcohol
fuel, but must be required if the ethanol plant or biobutanol facility meets or exceeds thresholds
of other categories of actions for which environmental assessment worksheets must be prepared.
The responsible governmental unit for an ethanol plant or biobutanol facility project for which
an environmental assessment worksheet is prepared shall be the state agency with the greatest
responsibility for supervising or approving the project as a whole.
   (b) The responsible governmental unit shall promptly publish notice of the completion of
an environmental assessment worksheet in a manner to be determined by the board and shall
provide copies of the environmental assessment worksheet to the board and its member agencies.
Comments on the need for an environmental impact statement may be submitted to the responsible
69TH DAY]                        THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2012                                      3691

governmental unit during a 30-day period following publication of the notice that an environmental
assessment worksheet has been completed. The responsible governmental unit's decision on the
need for an environmental impact statement shall be based on the environmental assessment
worksheet and the comments received during the comment period, and shall be made within 15
days after the close of the comment period. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not
more than 15 additional days upon the request of the responsible governmental unit.
    (c) An environmental assessment worksheet shall also be prepared for a proposed action
whenever material evidence accompanying a petition by not less than 100 individuals who reside
or own property in the state, submitted before the proposed project has received final approval
by the appropriate governmental units, demonstrates that, because of the nature or location of a
proposed action, there may be potential for significant environmental effects. Petitions requesting
the preparation of an environmental assessment worksheet shall be submitted to the board. The
chair of the board shall determine the appropriate responsible governmental unit and forward the
petition to it. A decision on the need for an environmental assessment worksheet shall be made by
the responsible governmental unit within 15 days after the petition is received by the responsible
governmental unit. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not more than 15 additional
days upon request of the responsible governmental unit.
   (d) Except in an environmentally sensitive location where Minnesota Rules, part 4410.4300,
subpart 29, item B, applies, the proposed action is exempt from environmental review under this
chapter and rules of the board, if:
   (1) the proposed action is:
   (i) an animal feedlot facility with a capacity of less than 1,000 animal units; or
   (ii) an expansion of an existing animal feedlot facility with a total cumulative capacity of less
than 1,000 animal units;
    (2) the application for the animal feedlot facility includes a written commitment by the proposer
to design, construct, and operate the facility in full compliance with Pollution Control Agency
feedlot rules; and
    (3) the county board holds a public meeting for citizen input at least ten business days prior
to the Pollution Control Agency or county issuing a feedlot permit for the animal feedlot facility
unless another public meeting for citizen input has been held with regard to the feedlot facility to be
permitted. The exemption in this paragraph is in addition to other exemptions provided under other
law and rules of the board.
    (e) The board may, prior to final approval of a proposed project, require preparation of an
environmental assessment worksheet by a responsible governmental unit selected by the board for
any action where environmental review under this section has not been specifically provided for by
rule or otherwise initiated.
    (f) An early and open process shall be utilized to limit the scope of the environmental impact
statement to a discussion of those impacts, which, because of the nature or location of the project,
have the potential for significant environmental effects. The same process shall be utilized to
determine the form, content and level of detail of the statement as well as the alternatives which
are appropriate for consideration in the statement. In addition, the permits which will be required
3692                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [69TH DAY

for the proposed action shall be identified during the scoping process. Further, the process shall
identify those permits for which information will be developed concurrently with the environmental
impact statement. The board shall provide in its rules for the expeditious completion of the scoping
process. The determinations reached in the process shall be incorporated into the order requiring
the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (g) The responsible governmental unit shall, to the extent practicable, avoid duplication and
ensure coordination between state and federal environmental review and between environmental
review and environmental permitting. Whenever practical, information needed by a governmental
unit for making final decisions on permits or other actions required for a proposed project shall be
developed in conjunction with the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (h) An environmental impact statement shall be prepared and its adequacy determined within
280 days after notice of its preparation unless the time is extended by consent of the parties or
by the governor for good cause. The responsible governmental unit shall determine the adequacy
of an environmental impact statement, unless within 60 days after notice is published that an
environmental impact statement will be prepared, the board chooses to determine the adequacy of
an environmental impact statement. If an environmental impact statement is found to be inadequate,
the responsible governmental unit shall have 60 days to prepare an adequate environmental impact
statement.
    (i) The proposer of a specific action may include in the information submitted to the responsible
governmental unit a preliminary draft environmental impact statement under this section on
that action for review, modification, and determination of completeness and adequacy by the
responsible governmental unit. A preliminary draft environmental impact statement prepared by
the project proposer and submitted to the responsible governmental unit shall identify or include as
an appendix all studies and other sources of information used to substantiate the analysis contained
in the preliminary draft environmental impact statement. The responsible governmental unit shall
require additional studies, if needed, and obtain from the project proposer all additional studies and
information necessary for the responsible governmental unit to perform its responsibility to review,
modify, and determine the completeness and adequacy of the environmental impact statement.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116D.04, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5b. Review and repeal of environmental assessment worksheets and impact
statements. By December 1, 2012, and each year thereafter, the Environmental Quality Board,

Coordinating Commission; the chairs of the house of representatives and senate committees having
jurisdiction over environment and natural resources; and the revisor of statutes a list of categories of
mandatory environmental assessment worksheets or mandatory environmental impact statements
for which the agency or a political subdivision is designated as the responsible government unit,
and for each worksheet or statement, a document including:
   (1) intended outcomes of the specific worksheet or statement;
   (2) the cost to state and local government and the private sector;
