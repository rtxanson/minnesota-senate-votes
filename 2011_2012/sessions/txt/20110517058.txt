provider audits; amending Minnesota Statutes 2010, sections 62Q.76, by adding a subdivision;
62Q.78, by adding subdivisions.
   Senator Vandeveer moved to amend S.F. No. 302 as follows:

   "Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 62Q.78, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 5. Provider audits. (a) A dental organization that conducts audits of dental providers
shall:
    (1) provide a written explanation to the dental provider of the reason for the audit and the process
the dental organization intends to use to audit patient charts, as well as a written explanation of the
processes available to the provider once the dental organization completes its review of the audited
patient records; and
    (2) allow the provider a reasonable period of time from the date that the provider receives the
verified audit or investigation findings to review, meet, and negotiate a resolution to the audit or
investigation.
   (b) If a dental organization conducts a provider audit, the dental organization must use a licensed
dentist whose license is in good standing to review patient charts."

addition, the commissioner must assess a penalty equal to 40 percent of the amount fraudulently
obtained. This penalty is in addition to penalties under section 268.182.

determination of overpayment by fraud to the applicant by mail or electronic transmission, the
determination is final. Proceedings on the appeal are conducted in accordance with section 268.105.
    (c) If the applicant fails to repay the unemployment benefits, penalty, and interest assessed, the
total due may be collected by the methods allowed under state and federal law. A determination of
overpayment by fraud must state the methods of collection the commissioner may use to recover
the overpayment. Money received in repayment of fraudulently obtained unemployment benefits,
penalties, and interest is first applied to the unemployment benefits overpaid, then to the penalty
amount due, then to any interest due. ­    62­­5

   (d) If an applicant has been overpaid unemployment benefits under the law of another state
because of fraud and that state certifies that the applicant is liable to repay the unemployment benefits
and requests the commissioner to recover the overpayment, the commissioner may offset from future
unemployment benefits otherwise payable the amount of overpayment.
    (e) Unemployment benefits paid for weeks more than four years before the date of a
determination of overpayment by fraud issued under this subdivision are not considered overpaid
unemployment benefits.
     Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 268.18, subdivision 2b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2b. Interest. (a) On any unemployment benefits fraudulently obtained, and any penalty
amounts assessed under subdivision 2, the commissioner must assess interest at the rate of 1-1/2
percent per month on any amount that remains unpaid beginning 30 calendar days after the date of
the determination of overpayment by fraud. A determination of overpayment by fraud must state
that interest will be assessed.
    (b) If the determination did not state that interest will be assessed, interest is assessed beginning
30 calendar days after notification, by mail or electronic transmission, to the applicant that interest
is now assessed.
                                                                  ad

independent contractor exemption certificate if the individual has not submitted a complete
application and certificate fee or if the individual does not meet all of the conditions for holding
the independent contractor exemption certificate. The commissioner may revoke an independent
contractor exemption certificate if the commissioner determines that the individual no longer meets
all of the conditions for holding the independent contractor exemption certificate, commits any of
the actions set out in subdivision 7, or fails to cooperate with a department investigation into the
continued validity of the individual's certificate. Once issued, an independent contractor exemption
certificate remains in effect for four years unless:

contractor exemption certificate or revokes an independent contractor exemption certificate, the
commissioner shall issue to the individual an order denying or revoking the certificate. The
commissioner may issue an administrative penalty order to an individual or person who commits
any of the actions set out in subdivision 7. The commissioner may file and enforce the unpaid
portion of a penalty as a judgment in district court without further notice or additional proceedings.
    (e) An individual or person to whom the commissioner issues an order under paragraph (d) shall

of the value between $4,000,000 and $5,000,000; and
    (6) if the valuation exceeds $5,000,000, the surcharge is $1,500 plus one-twentieth mill (.00005)
of the value that exceeds $5,000,000.

    Subdivision 1. License required. (a) No individual shall engage in or work at the business
of a master plumber, restricted master plumber, journeyman plumber, and restricted journeyman
plumber unless licensed to do so by the commissioner. A license is not required for individuals
performing building sewer or water service installation who have completed pipe laying training
as prescribed by the commissioner. A master plumber may also work as a journeyman plumber,
a restricted journeyman plumber, and a restricted master plumber. A journeyman plumber may
also work as a restricted journeyman plumber. Anyone not so licensed may do plumbing work
which complies with the provisions of the minimum standards prescribed by the Plumbing Board
on premises or that part of premises owned and actually occupied by the worker as a residence,
unless otherwise forbidden to do so by a local ordinance.
    (b) No person shall engage in the business of planning, superintending, or installing plumbing
or shall install plumbing in connection with the dealing in and selling of plumbing material and
supplies unless at all times a licensed master plumber, or in cities and towns with a population of
fewer than 5,000 according to the last federal census, a restricted master plumber, who shall be
responsible for proper installation, is in charge of the plumbing work of the person.
    (c) Except as provided in subdivision ­2 1a, no person shall perform or offer to perform plumbing
work with or without compensation unless the person obtains a contractor's license. A contractor's
license does not of itself qualify its holder to perform the plumbing work authorized by holding a
master, journeyman, restricted master, or restricted journeyman license.
    Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 326B.46, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 1a. Exemptions from licensing. (a) An individual without a contractor license may do
plumbing work on the individual's residence in accordance with subdivision 1, paragraph (a).
     (b) An individual who is an employee working on the maintenance and repair of plumbing
equipment, apparatus, or facilities owned or leased by the individual's employer and which is within
the limits of property owned or leased, and operated or maintained by the individual's employer,
shall not be required to maintain a contractor license as long as the employer has on file with
the commissioner a current certificate of responsible p   ­­ s­

any and all persons, regardless of the number of claims made against the bond, may not exceed the
annual amount of the bond. The bond may be canceled as to future liability by the surety upon 30

   Sec. 49. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 326B.89, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
   Subd. 6. Verified application. To be eligible for compensation from the fund, an owner or lessee
shall serve on the commissioner a verified application for compensation on a form approved by the
commissioner. The application shall verify the following information:
   (1) the specific grounds upon which the owner or lessee seeks to recover from the fund:
   (2) that the owner or the lessee has obtained a final judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction
against a licensee licensed under section 326B.83;
    (3) that the final judgment was obtained against the licensee on the grounds of fraudulent,
deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure of performance that arose directly
out of a contract directly between the licensee and the homeowner or lessee that was entered into
prior to the cause of action and that occurred when the licensee was licensed and performing any
of the special skills enumerated under section 326B.802, subdivision 15;
    (4) the amount of the owner's or the lessee's actual and direct out-of-pocket loss on the owner's
residential real estate, on residential real estate leased by the lessee, or on new residential real estate
that has never been occupied or that was occupied by the licensee for less than one year prior to
purchase by the owner;
   (5) that the residential real estate is located in Minnesota;
    (6) that the owner or the lessee is not the spouse of the licensee or the personal representative
of the licensee;
    (7) the amount of the final judgment, any amount paid in satisfaction of the final judgment, and
the amount owing on the final judgment as of the date of the verified application;
    (8) that the owner or lessee has diligently pursued remedies against all the judgment debtors and
all other persons liable to the judgment debtor in the contract for which the owner or lessee seeks
recovery from the fund; and

   (9) that the verified application is being served within two years after the judgment became final.
    The verified application must include documents evidencing the amount of the owner's or
the lessee's actual and direct out-of-pocket loss. The owner's and the lessee's actual and direct
out-of-pocket loss shall not include any attorney fees, litigation costs or fees, interest on the loss,
and interest on the final judgment obtained as a result of the loss or any costs not directly related
to the value difference between what was contracted for and what was provided. Any amount paid
in satisfaction of the final judgment shall be applied to the owner's or lessee's actual and direct
out-of-pocket loss. An owner or lessee may serve a verified application regardless of whether
the final judgment has been discharged by a bankruptcy court. A judgment issued by a court is
final if all proceedings on the judgment have either been pursued and concluded or been forgone,
including all reviews and appeals. For purposes of this section, owners who are joint tenants or
tenants in common are deemed to be a single owner. For purposes of this section, owners and
lessees eligible for payment of compensation from the fund shall not include government agencies,
political subdivisions, financial institutions, and any other entity that purchases, guarantees, or
insures a loan secured by real estate.
   Sec. 50. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 326B.89, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
    Subd. 8. Administrative hearing. If an owner or a lessee timely serves a request for hearing
under subdivision 7, the commissioner shall request that an administrative law judge be assigned
and that a hearing be conducted under the contested case provisions of chapter 14 within 45 days
after the commissioner received the request for hearing, unless the parties agree to a later date. The
commissioner must notify the owner or lessee of the time and place of the hearing at least 15 days
before the hearing. Upon petition of the commissioner, the administrative law judge shall continue
the hearing up to 60 days and upon a showing of good cause may continue the hearing for such
additional period as the administrative law judge deems appropriate.
    At the hearing the owner or the lessee shall have the burden of proving by substantial evidence
under subdivision 6, clauses (1) to (8). Whenever an applicant's judgment is by default, stipulation,
or consent, or whenever the action against the licensee was defended by a trustee in bankruptcy, the
applicant shall have the burden of proving the cause of action for fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest
practices, conversion of funds, or failure of performance. Otherwise, the judgment shall create a
rebuttable presumption of the fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or
failure of performance. This presumption affects the burden of producing evidence.
     The administrative law judge shall issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order. If the
administrative law judge finds that compensation should be paid to the owner or the lessee, the
administrative law judge shall order the commissioner to make payment from the fund of the amount
it finds to be payable pursuant to the provisions of and in accordance with the limitations contained
in this section. The order of the administrative law judge shall constitute the final decision of the
agency in the contested case. The commissioner or the owner or lessee may seek judicial review of
                                                                               sh

     Sec. 56. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 327.33, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Fees. The commissioner shall by rule establish reasonable fees for seals, installation
seals and inspections which are sufficient to cover all costs incurred in the administration of
sections 327.31 to 327.35. The commissioner shall also establish by rule a monitoring inspection
fee in an amount that will comply with the secretary's fee distribution program. This monitoring
inspection fee shall be an amount paid by the manufacturer for each manufactured home produced
in Minnesota. The monitoring inspection fee shall be paid by the manufacturer to the secretary.
The rules of the fee distribution program require the secretary to distribute the fees collected from
all manufactured home manufacturers among states approved and conditionally approved based
on the number of new manufactured homes whose first location after leaving the manufacturer is
on the premises of a distributor, dealer or purchaser in that state. Fees for inspections in areas that
have not adopted the State Building Code must be equal to the fees for inspections in code areas of
the state. Third party vendors may charge their usual and normal charge for inspections.

    (6) the owner of the manufactured home is not a resident of the manufactured home park, as
defined in section 327C.01, subdivision 9, or the owner of the manufactured home is a resident, but

                                 COURTS AND SENTENCING
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.797, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Penalty. (a) A person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor. A person
is guilty of a gross misdemeanor who violates this section within ten years of the first of two prior
convictions under this section, section 169.791, or a statute or ordinance in conformity with one of
those sections. The operator of a vehicle who violates subdivision 3 and who causes or contributes
to causing a vehicle accident that results in the death of any person or in substantial bodily harm to
any person, as defined in section 609.02, subdivision 7a, is guilty of a gross misdemeanor. The same
prosecuting authority who is responsible for prosecuting misdemeanor violations of this section is
responsible for prosecuting gross misdemeanor violations of this section. In addition to any sentence
of imprisonment that the court may impose on a person convicted of violating this section, the court
shall impose a fine of not less than $200 nor more than the maximum amount authorized by law.
The court may allow community service in lieu of any fine imposed if the defendant is indigent.
   (b) A driver who is the owner of the vehicle may, no later than the date and time specified
2190                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [58TH DAY

in the citation for the driver's first court appearance, produce proof of insurance stating that
security had been provided for the vehicle that was being operated at the time of demand to the
court administrator. The required proof of insurance may be sent by mail by the driver as long
as it is received no later than the date and time specified in the citation for the driver's first court
appearance. If a citation is issued, no person shall be convicted of violating this section if the court
administrator receives the required proof of insurance no later than the date and time specified
in the citation for the driver's first court appearance. If the charge is made other than by citation,
no person shall be convicted of violating this section if the person presents the required proof of
insurance at the person's first court appearance after the charge is made.
    (c) If the driver is not the owner of the vehicle, the driver shall, no later than the date and
time specified in the citation for the driver's first court appearance, provide the district court
administrator with proof of insurance or the name and address of the owner. Upon receipt of the
name and address of the owner, the district court administrator shall communicate the information
to the law enforcement agency.
    (d) If the driver is not the owner of the vehicle, the officer may send or provide a notice to the
owner of the vehicle requiring the owner to produce proof of insurance for the vehicle that was
being operated at the time of the demand. Notice by mail is presumed to be received five days after
mailing and shall be sent to the owner's current address or the address listed on the owner's driver's
license. Within ten days after receipt of the notice, the owner shall produce the required proof of
insurance to the place stated in the notice received by the owner. The required proof of insurance
may be sent by mail by the owner as long as it is received within ten days. Any owner who fails to
produce proof of insurance within ten days of an officer's request under this subdivision is guilty of
a misdemeanor. The peace officer may mail the citation to the owner's current address or address
stated on the owner's driver's license. It is an affirmative defense to a charge against the owner that
the driver used the owner's vehicle without consent, if insurance would not have been required in
the absence of the unauthorized use by the driver. It is not a defense that a person failed to notify
the Department of Public Safety of a change of name or address as required under section 171.11.
The citation may be sent after the ten-day period.
    ­
    (b
     ­­) (e) The court may impose consecutive sentences for offenses arising out of a single course
of conduct as permitted in section 609.035, subdivision 2.
    ­
    (­
     c­
      ) (f) In addition to the criminal penalty, the driver's license of an operator convicted under
this section shall be revoked for not more than 12 months. If the operator is also an owner of the
vehicle, the registration of the vehicle shall also be revoked for not more than 12 months. Before
reinstatement of a driver's license or registration, the operator shall file with the commissioner of
public safety the written certificate of an insurance carrier authorized to do business in this state
stating that security has been provided by the operator as required by section 65B.48.
   ­
   (d
    ­­) (g) The commissioner shall include a notice of the penalties contained in this section on all
forms for registration of vehicles required to maintain a plan of reparation security.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 260C.331, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. Court expenses. The following expenses are a charge upon the county in which
proceedings are held upon certification of the judge of juvenile court or upon such other
authorization provided by law:
58TH DAY]                               TUESDAY, MAY 17, 2011                                              2191

   (1) the fees and mileage of witnesses, and the expenses and mileage of officers serving notices
and subpoenas ordered by the court, as prescribed by law;
    (2) the expense of transporting a child to a place designated by a child-placing agency for the
care of the child if the court transfers legal custody to a child-placing agency;
    (3) the expense of transporting a minor to a place designated by the court;
    (4) reasonable compensation for an attorney appointed by the court to serve as counsel.
   The State Guardian Ad Litem Board shall pay for guardian ad litem expenses and reasonable
compensation for an attorney to serve as counsel for a guardian ad litem, if necessary. In no event
may the court order that guardian ad litem expenses or compensation for an attorney serving as
counsel for a guardian ad litem be charged to a county.
    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 357.021, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Surcharges on criminal and traffic offenders. (a) Except as provided in this
paragraph, the court shall impose and the court administrator shall collect a $75 surcharge on every
person convicted of any felony, gross misdemeanor, misdemeanor, or petty misdemeanor offense,
other than a violation of a law or ordinance relating to vehicle parking, for which there shall be a
$12 surcharge. When a defendant is convicted of more than one offense in a case, the surcharge
shall be imposed only once in that case. In the Second Judicial District, the court shall impose,
and the court administrator shall collect, an additional $1 surcharge on every person convicted of
any felony, gross misdemeanor, misdemeanor, or petty misdemeanor offense, including a violation
of a law or ordinance relating to vehicle parking, if the Ramsey County Board of Commissioners
authorizes the $1 surcharge. The surcharge shall be imposed whether or not the person is sentenced
to imprisonment or the sentence is stayed. The surcharge shall not be imposed when a person is
convicted of a petty misdemeanor for which no fine is imposed.
   (b) If the court fails to impose a surcharge as required by this subdivision, the court administrator
shall show the imposition of the surcharge, collect the surcharge, and correct the record.
    (c) The court may not waive payment of the surcharge required under this subdivision. Upon
a showing of indigency or undue hardship upon the convicted person or the convicted person's
immediate family, the sentencing court may authorize payment of the surcharge in installments.
   (d) The court administrator or other entity collecting a surcharge shall forward it to the
commissioner of management and budget.
    (e) If the convicted person is sentenced to imprisonment and has not paid the surcharge before
the term of imprisonment begins, the chief executive officer of the correctional facility in which the
convicted person is incarcerated shall collect the surcharge from any earnings the inmate accrues
from work performed in the facility or while on conditional release. The chief executive officer
shall forward the amount collected to the court administrator or other entity collecting the surcharge
imposed by the court.

   (g) The surcharge does not apply to administrative citations issued pursuant to section 169.999.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 563.01, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Authorization of forma pauperis. (a) Any court of the state of Minnesota or any
political subdivision thereof may authorize the commencement or defense of any civil action, or
appeal therein, without prepayment of fees, costs and security for costs by a natural person who
makes affidavit stating (a) the nature of the action, defense or appeal, (b) a belief that affiant is
entitled to redress, and (c) that affiant is financially unable to pay the fees, costs and security for
costs.
    (b) Upon a finding by the court that the action is not of a frivolous nature, the court shall allow
the person to proceed in forma pauperis if the affidavit is substantially in the language required by
this subdivision and is not found by the court to be untrue. Persons meeting the requirements of
this subdivision include, but are not limited to, a person who is receiving public assistance, who is
represented by an attorney on behalf of a civil legal services program or a volunteer attorney program

a juvenile alcohol offense, a juvenile controlled substance offense, a violation of section 609.685,

when, in the treating physician's or physicians' reasonable medical judgment:
   (i) the infant is chronically and irreversibly comatose;

and the treatment itself under the circumstances would be inhumane;
    (6) is one whose parent, guardian, or other custodian for good cause desires to be relieved of

    (b) The court may not waive payment of the minimum assessment required by this section. If
the defendant qualifies for the services of a public defender or the court finds on the record that
the convicted person is indigent or that immediate payment of the assessment would create undue
hardship for the convicted person or that person's immediate family, the court may reduce the amount
of the minimum assessment to not less than $100. The court also may authorize payment of the
assessment in installments.
      (c) The assessment collected under paragraph (a) must be distributed as follows:
    (1) 40 percent of the assessment shall be forwarded to the political subdivision that employs
the arresting officer for use in enforcement, training, and education activities related to combating
sexual exploitation of youth, or if the arresting officer is an employee of the state, this portion shall
be forwarded to the commissioner of public safety for those purposes identified in clause (3);
    (2) 20 percent of the assessment shall be forwarded to the prosecuting agency that handled the
case for use in training and education activities relating to combating sexual exploitation activities
of youth; and
    (3) 40 percent of the assessment must be forwarded to the commissioner of public safety to be
deposited in the safe harbor for youth account in the special revenue fund and are appropriated to
the commissioner for distribution to crime victims services organizations that provide services to
sexually exploited youth, as defined in section 260C.007, subdivision 31.
      (d) A safe harbor for youth account is established as a special account in the state treasury.
