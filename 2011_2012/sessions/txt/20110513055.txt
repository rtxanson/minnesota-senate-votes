    Subd. 1a. Investment, expenditure, and contribution; public utility. (a) For purposes of
this subdivision and subdivision 2, "public utility" has the meaning given it in section 216B.02,
subdivision 4. Each public utility shall spend and invest for energy conservation improvements
under this subdivision and subdivision 2 the following amounts:
   (1) for a utility that furnishes gas service, 0.5 percent of its gross operating revenues from service
provided in the state;
    (2) for a utility that furnishes electric service, 1.5 percent of its gross operating revenues from
service provided in the state; and
    (3) for a utility that furnishes electric service and that operates a nuclear-powered electric
generating plant within the state, two percent of its gross operating revenues from service provided
in the state.
    For purposes of this paragraph (a), "gross operating revenues" do not include revenues from
large electric customer facilities exempted by the commissioner under paragraph (b).
    (b) The owner of a large electric customer facility may petition the commissioner to exempt
both electric and gas utilities serving the large energy customer facility from the investment and
expenditure requirements of paragraph (a) with respect to retail revenues attributable to the facility.
At a minimum, the petition must be supported by evidence relating to competitive or economic
pressures on the customer and a showing by the customer of reasonable efforts to identify, evaluate,
and implement cost-effective conservation improvements at the facility. If a petition is filed on or
before October 1 of any year, the order of the commissioner to exempt revenues attributable to the
facility can be effective no earlier than January 1 of the following year. The commissioner shall not
grant an exemption if the commissioner determines that granting the exemption is contrary to the
public interest. The commissioner may, after investigation, rescind any exemption granted under this
paragraph upon a determination that the customer is not continuing to make reasonable efforts to
identify, evaluate, and implement energy conservation improvements at the large electric customer
facility. For the purposes of investigations by the commissioner under this paragraph, the owner
of any large electric customer facility shall, upon request, provide the commissioner with updated
information comparable to that originally supplied in or with the owner's original petition under this
paragraph.
   (c) The commissioner may require investments or spending greater than the amounts required
under this subdivision for a public utility whose most recent advance forecast required under section
216B.2422 or 216C.17 projects a peak demand deficit of 100 megawatts or greater within five years
under midrange forecast assumptions.
    (d) The owner of a large gas customer facility may petition the commissioner to exempt a gas
utility serving the large gas customer facility from the investment and expenditure requirements
of paragraph (a) with respect to retail revenues attributable to the facility. At a minimum, the
petition must be supported by evidence relating to competitive or economic pressures on the
customer and a showing by the customer of reasonable efforts to identify, evaluate, and implement
cost-effective conservation improvements at the facility. If a petition is filed on or before October
1 of any year, the order of the commissioner to exempt revenues attributable to the facility can
be effective no earlier than January 1 of the following year. The commissioner shall not grant an
exemption if the commissioner determines that granting the exemption is contrary to the public
interest. The commissioner may, after investigation, rescind any exemption granted under this

paragraph upon a determination that the customer is not continuing to make reasonable efforts to
identify, evaluate, and implement energy conservation improvements at the exempt facility. For the
purposes of investigations by the commissioner under this paragraph and paragraph (e), the owner
of any large gas customer facility shall, upon request, provide the commissioner with updated
information comparable to that originally supplied in or with the owner's original petition under
this paragraph. For large gas customer facilities that have been exempted by the commissioner
under this paragraph, or commercial gas customer facilities that have been exempted by the
commissioner under paragraph (e), an audit or other report prepared by an independent third party
with expertise in energy conservation shall be prepared verifying that the customer has taken
reasonable and appropriate measures to implement cost-effective conservation improvements.
    (e) A commercial gas customer facility that is not a large gas customer facility may petition the
commissioner to exempt gas utilities with fewer than 600,000 customers serving the commercial gas
customer facility from the investment and expenditure requirements of paragraph (a) with respect to
retail revenues attributable to the facility. The petition must be supported by evidence demonstrating
that the commercial gas customer facility has or can reasonably acquire the capability to bypass use
of the utility's gas distribution system by obtaining natural gas directly from a supplier not regulated
by the commission.
    (f) A public utility or owner of a large electric or large gas customer facility, or of a commercial
gas customer facility that is not a large gas customer facility, may appeal a decision of the
commissioner under paragraph (b) o      ­­
                                         r, (c), (d), or (e) to the commission under subdivision 2. In
reviewing a decision of the commissioner under paragraph (b) ­        o­
                                                                       r, (c), (d), or (e), the commission
shall rescind the decision if it finds that the required investments or spending will:
   (1) not result in cost-effective energy conservation improvements; or
   (2) otherwise not be in the public interest."

    Subd. 2. Programs. (a) The commissioner may require public utilities to make investments
and expenditures in energy conservation improvements, explicitly setting forth the interest rates,
prices, and terms under which the improvements must be offered to the customers. The required
programs must cover no more than a three-year period. Public utilities shall file conservation
improvement plans by June 1, on a schedule determined by order of the commissioner, but at least
every three years. Plans received by a public utility by June 1 must be approved or approved as
modified by the commissioner by December 1 of that same year. The commissioner shall evaluate
the program on the basis of cost-effectiveness and the reliability of technologies employed. The
commissioner's order must provide to the extent practicable for a free choice, by consumers
participating in the program, of the device, method, material, or project constituting the energy
conservation improvement and for a free choice of the seller, installer, or contractor of the energy
conservation improvement, provided that the device, method, material, or project seller, installer,
or contractor is duly licensed, certified, approved, or qualified, including under the residential
conservation services program, where applicable.
   (b) The commissioner may require a utility to make an energy conservation improvement
investment or expenditure whenever the commissioner finds that the improvement will result in

energy savings at a total cost to the utility less than the cost to the utility to produce or purchase an
equivalent amount of new supply of energy. The commissioner shall nevertheless ensure that every
public utility operate one or more programs under periodic review by the department.
    (c) Each public utility subject to subdivision 1a may spend and invest annually up to ten percent
of the total amount required to be spent and invested on energy conservation improvements under
this section by the utility on research and development projects that meet the definition of energy
conservation improvement in subdivision 1 and that are funded directly by the public utility.
    (d) A public utility may not spend for or invest in energy conservation improvements that directly
benefit a large energy facility or a large electric customer facility for which the commissioner has
issued an exemption pursuant to subdivision 1a, paragraph (b). The commissioner shall consider and
may require a utility to undertake a program suggested by an outside source, including a political
subdivision, a nonprofit corporation, or community organization.
    (e) A utility, a political subdivision, or a nonprofit or community organization that has suggested
a program, the attorney general acting on behalf of consumers and small business interests, or a
utility customer that has suggested a program and is not represented by the attorney general under
section 8.33 may petition the commission to modify or revoke a department decision under this
section, and the commission may do so if it determines that the program is not cost-effective, does
not adequately address the residential conservation improvement needs of low-income persons, has
a long-range negative effect on one or more classes of customers, or is otherwise not in the public
interest. The commission shall reject a petition that, on its face, fails to make a reasonable argument
that a program is not in the public interest.
    (f) The commissioner may order a public utility to include, with the filing of the utility's
proposed conservation improvement plan under paragraph (a), the results of an independent audit
of the utility's conservation improvement programs and expenditures performed by the department
or an auditor with experience in the provision of energy conservation and energy efficiency services
approved by the commissioner and chosen by the utility. The audit must specify the energy savings
or increased efficiency in the use of energy within the service territory of the utility that is the result
of the spending and investments. The audit must evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the utility's
conservation programs.
   (g) A gas utility may not spend for or invest in energy conservation improvements that directly
benefit a large gas customer facility or commercial gas customer facility for which the commissioner
has issued an exemption pursuant to subdivision 1a, paragraph (d) or (e). The commissioner shall
consider and may require a utility to undertake a program suggested by an outside source, including
a political subdivision, a nonprofit corporation, or community organization."
