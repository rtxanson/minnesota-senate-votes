      Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116J.8737, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
      Subd. 5. Credit allowed. (a) A qualified investor or qualified fund is eligible for a credit equal
to:
      (1) 25 percent of the qualified investment in a qualified small business; or
      (2) 40 percent of the qualified investment in a qualified greater Minnesota business.
Investments made by a pass-through entity qualify for a credit only if the entity is a qualified fund.
The commissioner must not allocate more than $11,000,000 in credits to qualified investors or
qualified funds for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009, and before January 1, 2011,
and must not allocate more than $12,000,000 in credits per year for taxable years beginning after
December 31, 2010, and before January 1, 2015. Any portion of a taxable year's credits that is not
allocated by the commissioner does not cancel and may be carried forward to subsequent taxable
years until all credits have been allocated.
    (b) The commissioner may not allocate more than a total maximum amount in credits for
a taxable year to a qualified investor for the investor's cumulative qualified investments as an
individual qualified investor and as an investor in a qualified fund; for married couples filing
joint returns the maximum is $250,000, and for all other filers the maximum is $125,000. The
commissioner may not allocate more than a total of $1,000,000 in credits over all taxable years for
qualified investments in any one qualified small business.
92ND DAY]                            FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012                                         4805

    (c) The commissioner may not allocate a credit to a qualified investor either as an individual
qualified investor or as an investor in a qualified fund if the investor receives more than 50 percent
of the investor's gross annual income from the qualified small business in which the qualified
investment is proposed. A member of the family of an individual disqualified by this paragraph is
not eligible for a credit under this section. For a married couple filing a joint return, the limitations
in this paragraph apply collectively to the investor and spouse. For purposes of determining the
ownership interest of an investor under this paragraph, the rules under section 267(c) and 267(e) of
the Internal Revenue Code apply.
   (d) Applications for tax credits for 2010 must be made available on the department's Web site by
September 1, 2010, and the department must begin accepting applications by September 1, 2010.
Applications for subsequent years must be made available by November 1 of the preceding year.
    (e) Qualified investors and qualified funds must apply to the commissioner for tax credits. Tax
credits must be allocated to qualified investors or qualified funds in the order that the tax credit
request applications are filed with the department. The commissioner must approve or reject tax
credit request applications within 15 days of receiving the application. The investment specified in
the application must be made within 60 days of the allocation of the credits. If the investment is not
made within 60 days, the credit allocation is canceled and available for reallocation. A qualified
investor or qualified fund that fails to invest as specified in the application, within 60 days of
allocation of the credits, must notify the commissioner of the failure to invest within five business
days of the expiration of the 60-day investment period.
    (f) All tax credit request applications filed with the department on the same day must be treated
as having been filed contemporaneously. If two or more qualified investors or qualified funds file
tax credit request applications on the same day, and the aggregate amount of credit allocation claims
exceeds the aggregate limit of credits under this section or the lesser amount of credits that remain
unallocated on that day, then the credits must be allocated among the qualified investors or qualified
funds who filed on that day on a pro rata basis with respect to the amounts claimed. The pro rata
allocation for any one qualified investor or qualified fund is the product obtained by multiplying
a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the credit allocation claim filed on behalf of a
qualified investor and the denominator of which is the total of all credit allocation claims filed on
behalf of all applicants on that day, by the amount of credits that remain unallocated on that day for
the taxable year.
    (g) A qualified investor or qualified fund, or a qualified small business acting on their behalf,
must notify the commissioner when an investment for which credits were allocated has been made,
and the taxable year in which the investment was made. A qualified fund must also provide the
commissioner with a statement indicating the amount invested by each investor in the qualified
fund based on each investor's share of the assets of the qualified fund at the time of the qualified
investment. After receiving notification that the investment was made, the commissioner must issue
credit certificates for the taxable year in which the investment was made to the qualified investor or,
for an investment made by a qualified fund, to each qualified investor who is an investor in the fund.
The certificate must state that the credit is subject to revocation if the qualified investor or qualified
fund does not hold the investment in the qualified small business for at least three years, consisting
of the calendar year in which the investment was made and the two following years. The three-year
holding period does not apply if:
   (1) the investment by the qualified investor or qualified fund becomes worthless before the end
4806                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [92ND DAY

of the three-year period;
    (2) 80 percent or more of the assets of the qualified small business is sold before the end of the
three-year period;
   (3) the qualified small business is sold before the end of the three-year period; or
   (4) the qualified small business's common stock begins trading on a public exchange before the
end of the three-year period.
    (h) The commissioner must notify the commissioner of revenue of credit certificates issued under
this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment for taxable
years beginning after December 31, 2011.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116J.8737, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Revocation of credits. (a) If the commissioner determines that a qualified investor
or qualified fund did not meet the three-year holding period required in subdivision 5, paragraph
(g), any credit allocated and certified to the investor or fund is revoked and must be repaid by the
investor.
    (b) If the commissioner determines that a business did not meet the employment and payroll
requirements in subdivision 2, paragraph (c), clause (2), or paragraph (h), clause (2), as applicable, in
any of the five calendar years following the year in which an investment in the business that qualified
for a tax credit under this section was made, the business must repay the following percentage of
the credits allowed for qualified investments in the business:
        Year following the year in which                       Percentage of credit required
            the investment was made:                                   to be repaid:
                        First                                             100%

                        Sixth and later                                       0

   (c) The commissioner must notify the commissioner of revenue of every credit revoked and
subject to full or partial repayment under this section.
   (d) For the repayment of credits allowed under this section and section 290.0692, a qualified
small business, qualified investor, or investor in a qualified fund must file an amended return with the
commissioner of revenue and pay any amounts required to be repaid within 30 days after becoming
subject to repayment under this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

2, who fails to pay to or deposit with the commissioner a sum or sums required by those sections
to be deducted, withheld, and paid, is personally and individually liable to the state for the sum
or sums, and added penalties and interest, and is not liable to another person for that payment or
payments. The sum or sums deducted and withheld under section 290.92, subdivision 2a or 3, or

    (b) If the employer or person withholding tax under section 290.92 or 290.923, subdivision 2,
fails to deduct and withhold the tax in violation of those sections, and later the taxes against which
the tax may be credited are paid, the tax required to be deducted and withheld will not be collected
from the employer. This does not, however, relieve the employer from liability for any penalties and
interest otherwise applicable for failure to deduct and withhold. This paragraph does not apply to
an employer subject to paragraph (g), ­o­­ t­ ­

    (g) If an employer fails to withhold tax from the wages of an employee when required to do so
under section 290.92, subdivision 2a, by reason of treating such employee as not being an employee,
then the liability for tax is equal to three percent of the wages paid to the employee. The liability for
tax of an employee is not affected by the assessment or collection of tax under this paragraph. The
employer is not entitled to recover from the employee any tax determined under this paragraph.

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 126C.40, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. To lease building or land. (a) When an independent or a special school district
or a group of independent or special school districts finds it economically advantageous to rent
or lease a building or land for any instructional purposes or for school storage or furniture repair,
and it determines that the operating capital revenue authorized under section 126C.10, subdivision
13, is insufficient for this purpose, it may apply to the commissioner for permission to make an
additional capital expenditure levy for this purpose. An application for permission to levy under
this subdivision must contain financial justification for the proposed levy, the terms and conditions
of the proposed lease, and a description of the space to be leased and its proposed use.
    (b) The criteria for approval of applications to levy under this subdivision must include: the
reasonableness of the price, the appropriateness of the space to the proposed activity, the feasibility
of transporting pupils to the leased building or land, conformity of the lease to the laws and rules
of the state of Minnesota, and the appropriateness of the proposed lease to the space needs and the
financial condition of the district. The commissioner must not authorize a levy under this subdivision
in an amount greater than the cost to the district of renting or leasing a building or land for approved
purposes. The proceeds of this levy must not be used for custodial or other maintenance services.
A district may not levy under this subdivision for the purpose of leasing or renting a district-owned
building or site to itself.
    (c) For agreements finalized after July 1, 1997, a district may not levy under this subdivision
for the purpose of leasing: (1) a newly constructed building used primarily for regular kindergarten,
elementary, or secondary instruction; or (2) a newly constructed building addition or additions used
primarily for regular kindergarten, elementary, or secondary instruction that contains more than 20
percent of the square footage of the previously existing building.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), a district may levy under this subdivision for the purpose
of leasing or renting a district-owned building or site to itself only if the amount is needed by the
district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement, installment purchase agreement,
or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, and the levy meets the requirements of

paragraph (c). A levy authorized for a district by the commissioner under this paragraph may be
in the amount needed by the district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement,
installment purchase agreement, or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, provided
that any agreement include a provision giving the school districts the right to terminate the agreement
annually without penalty.
    (e) The total levy under this subdivision for a district for any year must not exceed $150 times
the resident pupil units for the fiscal year to which the levy is attributable.
   (f) For agreements for which a review and comment have been submitted to the Department of
Education after April 1, 1998, the term "instructional purpose" as used in this subdivision excludes
expenditures on stadiums.
   (g) The commissioner of education may authorize a school district to exceed the limit in
paragraph (e) if the school district petitions the commissioner for approval. The commissioner
shall grant approval to a school district to exceed the limit in paragraph (e) for not more than five
years if the district meets the following criteria:
   (1) the school district has been experiencing pupil enrollment growth in the preceding five years;
   (2) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term public interest;
   (3) the purpose of the increased levy promotes colocation of government services; and
   (4) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term interest of the district by avoiding over
construction of school facilities.
    (h) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with leases of administrative and classroom space
for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed $43 times the adjusted
marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to any other authority
authorized under this section.
    (i) In addition to the allowable capital levies in paragraph (a), for taxes payable in 2012 to
2023, a district that is a member of the "Technology and Information Education Systems" data
processing joint board, that finds it economically advantageous to enter into a lease agreement to
finance improvements to a building and land for a group of school districts or special school districts
for staff development purposes, may levy for its portion of lease costs attributed to the district within
the total levy limit in paragraph (e). The total levy authority under this paragraph shall not exceed
$632,000.
    (j) In addition to the allowable capital levies in paragraph (a), a school district that is a member
of the St. Croix River Education District that finds it economically advantageous to enter into a lease
purchase agreement for a building and land for the St. Croix River Education District may levy for
its portion of lease costs attributed to the district within the total levy limit in paragraph (e). The
authority under this paragraph is effective for taxes payable in 2013 to 2028.

of a governmental unit under chapters 276A and 473F.
    The commissioner shall increase or decrease the preliminary or final rate for a year as necessary
to account for errors and tax base changes that affected a preliminary or final rate for either of the two
preceding years. Adjustments are allowed to the extent that the necessary information is available
to the commissioner at the time the rates for a year must be certified, and for the following reasons:
     (1) an erroneous report of taxable value by a local official;
     (2) an erroneous calculation by the commissioner; and
    (3) an increase or decrease in taxable value for commercial-industrial or seasonal residential
recreational property reported on the abstracts of tax lists submitted under section 275.29 that was
not reported on the abstracts of assessment submitted under section 270C.89 for the same year.
The commissioner may, but need not, make adjustments if the total difference in the tax levied for
the year would be less than $100,000.

    (c) If the board of estimate and taxation or any similar board that establishes maximum tax levies
for taxing jurisdictions within a first class city certifies the maximum property tax levies for funds
under its jurisdiction by charter to the county auditor by September 15, the city shall be deemed to
have certified its levies for those taxing jurisdictions.
    (d) For purposes of this section, "taxing authority" includes all home rule and statutory
cities, towns, counties, school districts, and special taxing districts as defined in section 275.066.
Intermediate school districts that levy a tax under chapter 124 or 136D, joint powers boards
established under sections 123A.44 to 123A.446, and Common School Districts No. 323,

under paragraph (a) or (b), the taxing authority shall announce the time and place of its subsequent
regularly scheduled meetings at which the budget and levy will be discussed and at which the public
will be allowed to speak. T

   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 275.065, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Notice of proposed property taxes. (a) The county auditor shall prepare and the county
treasurer shall deliver after November 10 and on or before November 24 each year, by first class
mail to each taxpayer at the address listed on the county's current year's assessment roll, a notice of
proposed property taxes. Upon written request by the taxpayer, the treasurer may send the notice in
electronic form or by electronic mail instead of on paper or by ordinary mail.
   (b) The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the notice.
    (c) The notice must inform taxpayers that it contains the amount of property taxes each taxing
authority proposes to collect for taxes payable the following year. In the case of a town, or in the case
of the state general tax, the final tax amount will be its proposed tax. The notice must clearly state for
each city that has a population over 500, county, school district, regional library authority established
under section 134.201, and metropolitan taxing districts as defined in paragraph (i), the time and
place of a meeting for each taxing authority in which the budget and levy will be discussed and
public input allowed, prior to the final budget and levy determination. The notice must clearly state
for each county and for each city with a population of more than 2,500 that the budget information
required to be reported under section 471.703 is available on the county or city Web site, if there is
one. The taxing authorities must provide the county auditor with the information to be included in
the notice on or before the time it certifies its proposed levy under subdivision 1. The public must be
allowed to speak at that meeting, which must occur after November 24 and must not be held before
6:00 p.m. It must provide a telephone number for the taxing authority that taxpayers may call if
they have questions related to the notice and an address where comments will be received by mail,
except that no notice required under this section shall be interpreted as requiring the printing of a
personal telephone number or address as the contact information for a taxing authority. If a taxing
authority does not maintain public offices where telephone calls can be received by the authority,
the authority may inform the county of the lack of a public telephone number and the county shall
not list a telephone number for that taxing authority.
   (d) The notice must state for each parcel:
    (1) the market value of the property as determined under section 273.11, and used for computing
property taxes payable in the following year and for taxes payable in the current year as each appears
in the records of the county assessor on November 1 of the current year; and, in the case of residential
property, whether the property is classified as homestead or nonhomestead. The notice must clearly
inform taxpayers of the years to which the market values apply and that the values are final values;
    (2) the items listed below, shown separately by county, city or town, and state general tax, net
of the residential and agricultural homestead credit under section 273.1384, voter approved school
levy, other local school levy, and the sum of the special taxing districts, and as a total of all taxing
authorities:
   (i) the actual tax for taxes payable in the current year; and
   (ii) the proposed tax amount.

under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed

higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, the levy for Minneapolis
Park and Recreation shall be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the

section 134.07 may be listed separately from the remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case
of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F
applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity
subject to the areawide tax must each be stated separately and not included in the sum of the special
taxing districts; and

   (1) special assessments;
    (2) levies approved by the voters after the date the proposed taxes are certified, including bond

    (5) amounts necessary to pay tort judgments against the taxing authority that become final after
the date the proposed taxes are certified; and
   (6) the contamination tax imposed on properties which received market value reductions for
contamination.
    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 7, failure of the county auditor to prepare or the county
treasurer to deliver the notice as required in this section does not invalidate the proposed or final tax
levy or the taxes payable pursuant to the tax levy.
   (g) If the notice the taxpayer receives under this section lists the property as nonhomestead,
and satisfactory documentation is provided to the county assessor by the applicable deadline, and

    (1) mail or deliver a copy of the notice of proposed property taxes to each tenant, renter, or
lessee; or
   (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
    The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of
receipt of the notice, whichever is later. A taxpayer may notify the county treasurer of the address
of the taxpayer, agent, caretaker, or manager of the premises to which the notice must be mailed in
order to fulfill the requirements of this paragraph.

board, include supplemental information with the statement of proposed property taxes about
the impact of state aid increases or decreases on property tax increases or decreases and on the

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.174, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Redevelopment district. (a) "Redevelopment district" means a type of tax increment
financing district consisting of a project, or portions of a project, within which the authority finds
by resolution that one or more of the following conditions, reasonably distributed throughout the
district, exists:
    (1) parcels consisting of 70 percent of the area of the district are occupied by buildings, streets,
utilities, paved or gravel parking lots, or other similar structures and m­o
                                                                           ­­ e ­h
                                                                             r­ t­­an

of the buildings, not including outbuildings, are structurally substandard to a degree requiring
substantial renovation or clearance;
    (2) the property consists of vacant, unused, underused, inappropriately used, or infrequently used
rail yards, rail storage facilities, or excessive or vacated railroad rights-of-way;
    (3) tank facilities, or property whose immediately previous use was for tank facilities, as defined
in section 115C.02, subdivision 15, if the tank facilities:
   (i) have or had a capacity of more than 1,000,000 gallons;
   (ii) are located adjacent to rail facilities; and
4850                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [92ND DAY

   (iii) have been removed or are unused, underused, inappropriately used, or infrequently used; or
   (4) a qualifying disaster area, as defined in subdivision 10b.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, "structurally substandard" shall mean containing defects
in structural elements or a combination of deficiencies in essential utilities and facilities, light and
ventilation, fire protection including adequate egress, layout and condition of interior partitions, or
similar factors, which defects or deficiencies are of sufficient total significance to justify substantial
renovation or clearance.
    (c) A building is not structurally substandard if it is in compliance with the building code
applicable to new buildings or could be modified to satisfy the building code at a cost of less than
15 percent of the cost of constructing a new structure of the same square footage and type on
the site. The municipality may find that a building is not disqualified as structurally substandard
under the preceding sentence on the basis of reasonably available evidence, such as the size,
type, and age of the building, the average cost of plumbing, electrical, or structural repairs, or
other similar reliable evidence. The municipality may not make such a determination without an
interior inspection of the property, but need not have an independent, expert appraisal prepared of
the cost of repair and rehabilitation of the building. An interior inspection of the property is not
required, if the municipality finds that (1) the municipality or authority is unable to gain access to
the property after using its best efforts to obtain permission from the party that owns or controls
the property; and (2) the evidence otherwise supports a reasonable conclusion that the building
is structurally substandard. Items of evidence that support such a conclusion include recent fire
or police inspections, on-site property tax appraisals or housing inspections, exterior evidence
of deterioration, or other similar reliable evidence. Written documentation of the findings and
reasons why an interior inspection was not conducted must be made and retained under section
469.175, subdivision 3, clause (1). Failure of a building to be disqualified under the provisions
of this paragraph is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition to determining that the building is
substandard.
    (d) A parcel is deemed to be occupied by a structurally substandard building for purposes of the
finding under paragraph (a) or by the improvements described in paragraph (e) if all of the following
conditions are met:
    (1) the parcel was occupied by a substandard building or met the requirements of paragraph (e),
as the case may be, within three years of the filing of the request for certification of the parcel as
part of the district with the county auditor;
    (2) the substandard building or the improvements described in paragraph (e) were demolished
or removed by the authority or the demolition or removal was financed by the authority or was done
by a developer under a development agreement with the authority;
    (3) the authority found by resolution before the demolition or removal that the parcel was
occupied by a structurally substandard building or met the requirements of paragraph (e) and that
after demolition and clearance the authority intended to include the parcel within a district; and
    (4) upon filing the request for certification of the tax capacity of the parcel as part of a district,
the authority notifies the county auditor that the original tax capacity of the parcel must be adjusted
as provided by section 469.177, subdivision 1, paragraph (f).

    (e) For purposes of this subdivision, a parcel is not occupied by buildings, streets, utilities, paved
or gravel parking lots, or other similar structures unless 15 percent of the area of the parcel contains
buildings, streets, utilities, paved or gravel parking lots, or other similar structures.
    (f) For districts consisting of two or more noncontiguous areas, each area must qualify as a
redevelopment district under paragraph (a) to be included in the district, and the entire area of the
district must satisfy paragraph (a).

   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.174, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 19a. Soil deficiency district. "Soil-deficiency district" means a type of tax increment
financing district consisting of a project, or portions of a project, within which the authority finds
by resolution that the following conditions exist:
     (1) parcels consisting of 70 percent of the area of the district contain unusual terrain or soil
deficiencies which require substantial filling, grading, or other physical preparation for use and a
parcel is eligible for inclusion if at least 50 percent of the area of the parcel requires substantial
filling, grading, or other physical preparation for use; and
    (2) the estimated cost of the physical preparation under clause (1), but excluding costs directly
related to roads as defined in section 160.01, and local improvements as described in sections
429.021, subdivision 1, clauses (1) to (7), (11), and (12), and 430.01, exceeds the fair market value

jurisdiction by finding by resolution, that parcels consisting of at least 70 percent of the acreage,
excluding street and railroad rights-of-way, are characterized by one or more of the following
conditions:
    (1) peat or other soils with geotechnical deficiencies that impair development of buildings or
infrastructure;
    (2) soils or terrain that requires substantial filling in order to permit the development of buildings
or infrastructure;
   (3) landfills, dumps, or similar deposits of municipal or private waste;
   (4) quarries or similar resource extraction sites;
   (5) floodway; and
   (6) substandard buildings, within the meaning of section 469.174, subdivision 10.
    (b) For the purposes of paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (5), a parcel is characterized by the
relevant condition if at least 50 percent of the area of the parcel contains the relevant condition.
For the purposes of paragraph (a), clause (6), a parcel is characterized by substandard buildings if
4852                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [92ND DAY

substandard buildings occupy at least 30 percent of the area of the parcel.
    (c) If the authority elects, upon the adoption of the tax increment financing plan for a district, the
rules under paragraphs (d) and (e) apply to a redevelopment district, renewal and renovation district,
soil condition district, or soil deficiency district established by the authority in a mining reclamation
project area.
    (d) Upon election of the authority under paragraph (c), for any district created in a mining
reclamation project area, the five-year rule under section 469.1763, subdivision 3, is extended to
ten years, and section 469.1763, subdivision 4, does not apply.
    (e) Upon election by the authority under paragraph (c), notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary in section 469.1763, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), not more than 80 percent of the total
revenue derived from tax increments paid by properties in any district, measured over the life of the
district, may be expended on activities outside the district but within the mining reclamation project
area.

may be used only to:
   (1) acquire parcels on which the improvements described in clause (2) will occur;
    (2) pay for the cost of correcting the unusual terrain or soil deficiencies and the additional cost
of installing public improvements directly caused by the deficiencies;
   (3) pay for the administrative expenses of the authority allocable to the district; and
   (4) up to 25 percent of the increment may be used to pay costs as provided in section 469.176,
subdivision 4j.
    (g) Increments spent for any infrastructure costs, whether inside a district or outside a district,
but within the project area, are deemed to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f), and section
469.176, subdivisions 4b and 4j.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for districts for which the request for certification
is made after April 30, 2012.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.176, subdivision 1b, is amended to read:
   Subd. 1b. Duration limits; terms. (a) No tax increment shall in any event be paid to the
authority:
    (1) after 15 years after receipt by the authority of the first increment for a renewal and renovation
district;
    (2) after 20 years after receipt by the authority of the first increment for a soils condition district
or a soil deficiency district;
   (3) after eight years after receipt by the authority of the first increment for an economic
development district;
   (4) for a housing district, a compact development district, or a redevelopment district, after 25

    (b) For purposes of determining a duration limit under this subdivision or subdivision 1e that
is based on the receipt of an increment, any increments from taxes payable in the year in which
the district terminates shall be paid to the authority. This paragraph does not affect a duration limit
calculated from the date of approval of the tax increment financing plan or based on the recovery of
costs or to a duration limit under subdivision 1c. This paragraph does not supersede the restrictions
on payment of delinquent taxes in subdivision 1f.
    (c) An action by the authority to waive or decline to accept an increment has no effect for
purposes of computing a duration limit based on the receipt of increment under this subdivision
or any other provision of law. The authority is deemed to have received an increment for any year
in which it waived or declined to accept an increment, regardless of whether the increment was paid
to the authority.
    (d) Receipt by a hazardous substance subdistrict of an increment as a result of a reduction in
original net tax capacity under section 469.174, subdivision 7, paragraph (b), does not constitute
receipt of increment by the overlying district for the purpose of calculating the duration limit under
this section.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for districts for which the request for certification
is made after April 30, 2012.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 469.1763, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Expenditures outside district. (a) For each tax increment financing district, an amount
equal to at least 75 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments paid by properties in the
district must be expended on activities in the district or to pay bonds, to the extent that the proceeds
of the bonds were used to finance activities in the district or to pay, or secure payment of, debt service
on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment districts for which the request for
certification was made after June 30, 1995, the in-district percentage for purposes of the preceding
sentence is 80 percent. Not more than 25 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments
paid by properties in the district may be expended, through a development fund or otherwise, on
activities outside of the district but within the defined geographic area of the project except to pay,
or secure payment of, debt service on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment
districts for which the request for certification was made after June 30, 1995, the pooling percentage
for purposes of the preceding sentence is 20 percent. The revenue derived from tax increments for
the district that are expended on costs under section 469.176, subdivision 4h, paragraph (b), may
be deducted first before calculating the percentages that must be expended within and without the
district.
    (b) In the case of a housing district, a housing project, as defined in section 469.174, subdivision
11, is an activity in the district.
    (c) All administrative expenses are for activities outside of the district, except that if the only
expenses for activities outside of the district under this subdivision are for the purposes described
in paragraph (d), administrative expenses will be considered as expenditures for activities in the
district.
    (d) The authority may elect, in the tax increment financing plan for the district, to increase by
up to ten percentage points the permitted amount of expenditures for activities located outside the
4854                                          JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                  [92ND DAY

geographic area of the district under paragraph (a). As permitted by section 469.176, subdivision
4k, the expenditures, including the permitted expenditures under paragraph (a), need not be made
within the geographic area of the project. Expenditures that meet the requirements of this paragraph
are legally permitted expenditures of the district, notwithstanding section 469.176, subdivisions 4b,
4c, 4d, and 4j. To qualify for the increase under this paragraph, the expenditures must:
     (1) be used exclusively to assist housing that
    (i) meets the requirement for a qualified low-income building, as that term is used in section 42
of the Internal Revenue Code; ­ an

commissioner shall apportion the fire state aid relative to the premiums reported on the Minnesota
Firetown Premium Reports filed under this chapter to each municipality and/or firefighters relief
association.
    (b) The commissioner shall calculate an initial fire state aid allocation amount for each
municipality or fire department under paragraph (c) and a minimum fire state aid allocation amount
for each municipality or fire department under paragraph (d). The municipality or fire department
must receive the larger fire state aid amount.
    (c) The initial fire state aid allocation amount is the amount available for apportionment as
fire state aid under subdivision 5, without inclusion of any additional funding amount to support
a minimum fire state aid amount under section 423A.02, subdivision 3, allocated one-half in
proportion to the population as shown in the last official statewide federal census for each fire

qualifying for the aid, the commissioner shall calculate the state aid for the municipality or relief
association on the basis of the population and the estimated market value of the area furnished
fire protection service by the fire department as evidenced by duly executed and valid fire service
agreements filed with the commissioner. If one or more fire departments are furnishing contracted
fire service to a city, town, or township, only the population and estimated market value of the
area served by each fire department may be considered in calculating the state aid and the fire
departments furnishing service shall enter into an agreement apportioning among themselves the
percent of the population and the estimated market value of each service area. The agreement must
be in writing and must be filed with the commissioner.
    (d) The minimum fire state aid allocation amount is the amount in addition to the initial fire state
allocation amount that is derived from any additional funding amount to support a minimum fire state
aid amount under section 423A.02, subdivision 3, and allocated to municipalities with volunteer
firefighters relief associations or covered by the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter
retirement plan based on the number of active volunteer firefighters who are members of the relief
association as reported in the annual financial reporting for the calendar year 1993 to the Office of
the State Auditor, but not to exceed 30 active volunteer firefighters, so that all municipalities or fire
departments with volunteer firefighters relief associations receive in total at least a minimum fire
state aid amount per 1993 active volunteer firefighter to a maximum of 30 firefighters. If a relief
association is established after calendar year 1993 and before calendar year 2000, the number of
active volunteer firefighters who are members of the relief association as reported in the annual
financial reporting for calendar year 1998 to the Office of the State Auditor, but not to exceed 30
active volunteer firefighters, shall be used in this determination. If a relief association is established
after calendar year 1999, the number of active volunteer firefighters who are members of the relief
association as reported in the first annual financial reporting submitted to the Office of the State
Auditor, but not to exceed 20 active volunteer firefighters, must be used in this determination. If a
relief association is terminated as a result of providing retirement coverage for volunteer firefighters
by the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter retirement plan under chapter 353G, the
number of active volunteer firefighters of the municipality covered by the statewide plan as certified
by the executive director of the Public Employees Retirement Association to the commissioner and
the state auditor, but not to exceed 30 active firefighters, must be used in this determination.
    (e) Unless the firefighters of the applicable fire department are members of the voluntary
statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter retirement plan, the fire state aid must be paid to
the treasurer of the municipality where the fire department is located and the treasurer of the
municipality shall, within 30 days of receipt of the fire state aid, transmit the aid to the relief
association if the relief association has filed a financial report with the treasurer of the municipality
and has met all other statutory provisions pertaining to the aid apportionment. If the firefighters
of the applicable fire department are members of the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer
firefighter retirement plan, the fire state aid must be paid to the executive director of the Public
Employees Retirement Association and deposited in the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer
firefighter retirement fund.
    (f) The commissioner may make rules to permit the administration of the provisions of this
section.
   (g) Any adjustments needed to correct prior misallocations must be made to subsequent
apportionments.

   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103B.245, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Tax. After adoption of the ordinance under subdivision 2, a local government unit may
annually levy a tax on all taxable property in the district for the purposes for which the tax district is
established. The tax may not exceed 0.02418 percent of estimated market value on taxable property
located in rural towns other than urban towns, unless allowed by resolution of the town electors. The
proceeds of the tax shall be paid into a fund reserved for these purposes. Any proceeds remaining in
the reserve fund at the time the tax is terminated or the district is dissolved shall be transferred and
irrevocably pledged to the debt service fund of the local unit to be used solely to reduce tax levies
for bonded indebtedness of taxable property in the district.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103B.251, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
    Subd. 8. Tax. (a) For the payment of principal and interest on the bonds issued under subdivision
7 and the payment required under subdivision 6, the county shall irrevocably pledge and appropriate
the proceeds of a tax levied on all taxable property located within the territory of the watershed
management organization or subwatershed unit for which the bonds are issued. Each year until
the reserve for payment of the bonds is sufficient to retire the bonds, the county shall levy on all
taxable property in the territory of the organization or unit, without respect to any statutory or other
limitation on taxes, an amount of taxes sufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds and to
restore any deficiencies in reserves required to be maintained for payment of the bonds.
     (b) The tax levied on rural towns other than urban towns may not exceed 0.02418 percent of
­a
t­x­­
    ab­­e
       l­ estimated market value, unless approved by resolution of the town electors.
   (c) If at any time the amounts available from the levy on property in the territory of the
organization are insufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds when due, the county shall
make payment from any available funds in the county treasury.
    (d) The amount of any taxes which are required to be levied outside of the territory of the
watershed management organization or unit or taken from the general funds of the county to pay
principal or interest on the bonds shall be reimbursed to the county from taxes levied within the
territory of the watershed management organization or unit.

92ND DAY]                               FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012                                               4869

    Subdivision 1. Generally. Except as provided in this section or section 273.17, subdivision 1, all
property shall be valued at its market value. The market value as determined pursuant to this section
shall be stated such that any amount under $100 is rounded up to $100 and any amount exceeding
$100 shall be rounded to the nearest $100. In estimating and determining such value, the assessor
shall not adopt a lower or different standard of value because the same is to serve as a basis of
taxation, nor shall the assessor adopt as a criterion of value the price for which such property would
sell at a forced sale, or in the aggregate with all the property in the town or district; but the assessor
shall value each article or description of property by itself, and at such sum or price as the assessor
believes the same to be fairly worth in money. The assessor shall take into account the effect on the
market value of property of environmental factors in the vicinity of the property. In assessing any
tract or lot of real property, the value of the land, exclusive of structures and improvements, shall be
determined, and also the value of all structures and improvements thereon, and the aggregate value
of the property, including all structures and improvements, excluding the value of crops growing
upon cultivated land. In valuing real property upon which there is a mine or quarry, it shall be valued
at such price as such property, including the mine or quarry, would sell for at a fair, voluntary sale,
for cash, if the material being mined or quarried is not subject to taxation under section 298.015 and
the mine or quarry is not exempt from the general property tax under section 298.25. In valuing
real property which is vacant, platted property shall be assessed as provided in ­        su

subdivisions 14a and 14c. All property, or the use thereof, which is taxable under section 272.01,
subdivision 2, or 273.19, shall be valued at the market value of such property and not at the value
of a leasehold estate in such property, or at some lesser value than its market value.

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.1398, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Disparity reduction aid. The amount of disparity aid certified for each taxing district
within each unique taxing jurisdiction for taxes payable in the prior year shall be multiplied by the
ratio of (1) the jurisdiction's tax capacity using the class rates for taxes payable in the year for which
aid is being computed, to (2) its tax capacity using the class rates for taxes payable in the year prior to
that for which aid is being computed, both based upon taxable market values for taxes payable in the
year prior to that for which aid is being computed. If the commissioner determines that insufficient
information is available to reasonably and timely calculate the numerator in this ratio for the first
taxes payable year that a class rate change or new class rate is effective, the commissioner shall omit
the effects of that class rate change or new class rate when calculating this ratio for aid payable in
that taxes payable year. For aid payable in the year following a year for which such omission was
made, the commissioner shall use in the denominator for the class that was changed or created, the
tax capacity for taxes payable two years prior to that in which the aid is payable, based on taxable
market values for taxes payable in the year prior to that for which aid is being computed.
    Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.1398, subdivision 4, is amended to read:

    Subd. 4. Disparity reduction credit. (a) Beginning with taxes payable in 1989, class 4a, class
3a, and class 3b property qualifies for a disparity reduction credit if: (1) the property is located in a
border city that has an enterprise zone designated pursuant to section 469.168, subdivision 4; (2) the
property is located in a city with a population greater than 2,500 and less than 35,000 according to
the 1980 decennial census; (3) the city is adjacent to a city in another state or immediately adjacent
to a city adjacent to a city in another state; and (4) the adjacent city in the other state has a population
of greater than 5,000 and less than 75,000 according to the 1980 decennial census.
    (b) The credit is an amount sufficient to reduce (i) the taxes levied on class 4a property to 2.3
percent of the property's taxable market value and (ii) the tax on class 3a and class 3b property to
2.3 percent of taxable market value.
    (c) The county auditor shall annually certify the costs of the credits to the Department of
Revenue. The department shall reimburse local governments for the property taxes forgone as the
result of the credits in proportion to their total levies.
    Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 275.011, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Determination of levy limit. The property tax levied for any purpose under a
special law that is not codified in Minnesota Statutes or a city charter provision and that is subject to
a mill rate limitation imposed by the special law or city charter provision, excluding levies subject
to mill rate limitations that use adjusted assessed values determined by the commissioner of revenue
under section 124.2131, must not exceed the following amount for the years specified:
   (a) for taxes payable in 1988, the product of the applicable mill rate limitation imposed by
special law or city charter provision multiplied by the total assessed valuation of all taxable property
subject to the tax as adjusted by the provisions of Minnesota Statutes 1986, sections 272.64; 273.13,
subdivision 7a; and 275.49;
    (b) for taxes payable in 1989, the product of (1) the property tax levy limitation for the taxes
payable year 1988 determined under clause (a) multiplied by (2) an index for market valuation
changes equal to the assessment year 1988 total market valuation of all taxable property subject to
the tax divided by the assessment year 1987 total market valuation of all taxable property subject to
the tax; and
    (c) for taxes payable in 1990 and subsequent years, the product of (1) the property tax levy
limitation for the previous year determined pursuant to this subdivision multiplied by (2) an index
for market valuation changes equal to the total market valuation of all taxable property subject to
the tax for the current assessment year divided by the total market valuation of all taxable property
subject to the tax for the previous assessment year.

   Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 276.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Contents of tax statements. (a) The treasurer shall provide for the printing of the tax
statements. The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the property tax statement
and its contents. The tax statement must not state or imply that property tax credits are paid by the
state of Minnesota. The statement must contain a tabulated statement of the dollar amount due to
each taxing authority and the amount of the state tax from the parcel of real property for which a
particular tax statement is prepared. The dollar amounts attributable to the county, the state tax, the
voter approved school tax, the other local school tax, the township or municipality, and the total
of the metropolitan special taxing districts as defined in section 275.065, subdivision 3, paragraph
(i), must be separately stated. The amounts due all other special taxing districts, if any, may be
aggregated except that any levies made by the regional rail authorities in the county of Anoka,
Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, or Washington under chapter 398A shall be listed on a
separate line directly under the appropriate county's levy. If the county levy under this paragraph
includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581,
the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately stated from the remaining county levy
amount. In the case of Ramsey County, if the county levy under this paragraph includes an amount
for public library service under section 134.07, the amount attributable for that purpose may be
separated from the remaining county levy amount. The amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying
under the senior citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount
of property tax before subtraction of the deferred property tax amount. The amount of the tax on
contamination value imposed under sections 270.91 to 270.98, if any, must also be separately stated.
The dollar amounts, including the dollar amount of any special assessments, may be rounded to the
nearest even whole dollar. For purposes of this section whole odd-numbered dollars may be adjusted
to the next higher even-numbered dollar. The amount of market value excluded under section 273.11,
subdivision 16, if any, must also be listed on the tax statement.

   (b) The property tax statements for manufactured homes and sectional structures taxed as
personal property shall contain the same information that is required on the tax statements for real
property.
   (c) Real and personal property tax statements must contain the following information in the order
given in this paragraph. The information must contain the current year tax information in the right
column with the corresponding information for the previous year in a column on the left:

    (d) If the county uses envelopes for mailing property tax statements and if the county agrees, a
taxing district may include a notice with the property tax statement notifying taxpayers when the
taxing district will begin its budget deliberations for the current year, and encouraging taxpayers
to attend the hearings. If the county allows notices to be included in the envelope containing the
property tax statement, and if more than one taxing district relative to a given property decides to
include a notice with the tax statement, the county treasurer or auditor must coordinate the process
and may combine the information on a single announcement.

    Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 287.08, is amended to read:
    287.08 TAX, HOW PAYABLE; RECEIPTS.
    (a) The tax imposed by sections 287.01 to 287.12 must be paid to the treasurer of any county in
this state in which the real property or some part is located at or before the time of filing the mortgage
for record. The treasurer shall endorse receipt on the mortgage and the receipt is conclusive proof that
the tax has been paid in the amount stated and authorizes any county recorder or registrar of titles to
record the mortgage. Its form, in substance, shall be "registration tax hereon of ..................... dollars
paid." If the mortgage is exempt from taxation the endorsement shall, in substance, be "exempt from
registration tax." In either case the receipt must be signed by the treasurer. In case the treasurer is
unable to determine whether a claim of exemption should be allowed, the tax must be paid as in
the case of a taxable mortgage. For documents submitted electronically, the endorsements and tax
amount shall be affixed electronically and no signature by the treasurer will be required. The actual
payment method must be arranged in advance between the submitter and the receiving county.
     (b) The county treasurer may refund in whole or in part any mortgage registry tax overpayment
if a written application by the taxpayer is submitted to the county treasurer within 3-1/2 years from
the date of the overpayment. If the county has not issued a denial of the application, the taxpayer
may bring an action in Tax Court in the county in which the tax was paid at any time after the
expiration of six months from the time that the application was submitted. A denial of refund may
be appealed within 60 days from the date of the denial by bringing an action in Tax Court in the
county in which the tax was paid. The action is commenced by the serving of a petition for relief
on the county treasurer, and by filing a copy with the court. The county attorney shall defend the
action. The county treasurer shall notify the treasurer of each county that has or would receive a
portion of the tax as paid.
    (c) If the county treasurer determines a refund should be paid, or if a refund is ordered by the
court, the county treasurer of each county that actually received a portion of the tax shall immediately
pay a proportionate share of three percent of the refund using any available county funds. The county
treasurer of each county that received, or would have received, a portion of the tax shall also pay
their county's proportionate share of the remaining 97 percent of the court-ordered refund on or
before the 20th day of the following month using solely the mortgage registry tax funds that would
be paid to the commissioner of revenue on that date under section 287.12. If the funds on hand
under this procedure are insufficient to fully fund 97 percent of the court-ordered refund, the county
treasurer of the county in which the action was brought shall file a claim with the commissioner of
4874                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [92ND DAY

revenue under section 16A.48 for the remaining portion of 97 percent of the refund, and shall pay
over the remaining portion upon receipt of a warrant from the state issued pursuant to the claim.
     (d) When any mortgage covers real property located in more than one county in this state the total
tax must be paid to the treasurer of the county where the mortgage is first presented for recording,
and the payment must be receipted as provided in paragraph (a). If the principal debt or obligation
secured by such a multiple county mortgage exceeds $10,000,000, the nonstate portion of the tax
must be divided and paid over by the county treasurer receiving it, on or before the 20th day of each
month after receipt, to the county or counties entitled in the ratio that the estimated market value
of the real property covered by the mortgage in each county bears to the estimated market value of
all the real property in this state described in the mortgage. In making the division and payment the
county treasurer shall send a statement giving the description of the real property described in the
mortgage and the estimated market value of the part located in each county. For this purpose, the
treasurer of any county may require the treasurer of any other county to certify to the former the
estimated market v ­­a­u

                              ­ value of any tract of real property in any mortgage.
    (e) The mortgagor must pay the tax imposed by sections 287.01 to 287.12. The mortgagee may
undertake to collect and remit the tax on behalf of the mortgagor. If the mortgagee collects money
from the mortgagor to remit the tax on behalf of the mortgagor, the mortgagee has a fiduciary duty
to remit the tax on behalf of the mortgagor as to the amount of the tax collected for that purpose and
the mortgagor is relieved of any further obligation to pay the tax as to the amount collected by the
mortgagee for this purpose.
   Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 287.23, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Real property outside county. If any taxable deed or instrument describes any
real property located in more than one county in this state, the total tax must be paid to the treasurer
of the county where the document is first presented for recording, and the payment must be receipted
as provided in section 287.08. If the net consideration exceeds $700,000, the nonstate portion of
the tax must be divided and paid over by the county treasurer receiving it, on or before the 20th
day of each month after receipt, to the county or counties entitled in the ratio which the estimated
market value of the real property covered by the document in each county bears to the estimated
market value of all the real property in this state described in the document. In making the division
and payment the county treasurer shall send a statement to the other involved counties giving the
description of the real property described in the document and the estimated market value of the part
located in each county. The treasurer of any county may require the treasurer of any other county
to certify to the former the estimated market v ­­a­u

purpose.
   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 353G.08, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Cash flow funding requirement. If the executive director determines that an account
in the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter retirement plan has insufficient assets to
meet the service pensions determined payable from the account, the executive director shall certify
the amount of the potential service pension shortfall to the municipality or municipalities and the
municipality or municipalities shall make an additional employer contribution to the account within
ten days of the certification. If more than one municipality is associated with the account, unless
the municipalities agree to a different allocation, the municipalities shall allocate the additional
employer contribution one-half in proportion to the population of each municipality and one-half in

proportion to the estimated market value of the property of each municipality.
   Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 365.025, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Major purchases: notice, petition, election. Before buying anything under subdivision
2 that costs more than 0.24177 percent of the estimated market value of the town, the town must
follow this subdivision.
    The town must publish in its official newspaper the board's resolution to pay for the property
over time. Then a petition for an election on the contract may be filed with the clerk. The petition
must be filed within ten days after the resolution is published. To require the election the petition
must be signed by a number of voters equal to ten percent of the voters at the last regular town
election. The contract then must be approved by a majority of those voting on the question. The
question may be voted on at a regular or special election.
   Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 366.095, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Certificates of indebtedness. The town board may issue certificates of
indebtedness within the debt limits for a town purpose otherwise authorized by law. The certificates
shall be payable in not more than ten years and be issued on the terms and in the manner as the
board may determine. If the amount of the certificates to be issued exceeds 0.25 percent of the
estimated market value of the town, they shall not be issued for at least ten days after publication
in a newspaper of general circulation in the town of the board's resolution determining to issue
them. If within that time, a petition asking for an election on the proposition signed by voters equal
to ten percent of the number of voters at the last regular town election is filed with the clerk, the
certificates shall not be issued until their issuance has been approved by a majority of the votes cast
on the question at a regular or special election. A tax levy shall be made to pay the principal and
interest on the certificates as in the case of bonds.
   Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 366.27, is amended to read:

   Sec. 45. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 368.47, is amended to read:
   368.47 TOWNS MAY BE DISSOLVED.
    (1) When the voters residing within a town have failed to elect any town officials for more than
ten years continuously;
    (2) when a town has failed for a period of ten years to exercise any of the powers and functions
of a town;
   (3) when the estimated market value of a town drops to less than $165,000;
   (4) when the tax delinquency of a town, exclusive of taxes that are delinquent or unpaid because
they are contested in proceedings for the enforcement of taxes, amounts to 12 percent of its market
value; or
   (5) when the state or federal government has acquired title to 50 percent of the real estate of a
town,
which facts, or any of them, may be found and determined by the resolution of the county board of
the county in which the town is located, according to the official records in the office of the county
auditor, the county board by resolution may declare the town, naming it, dissolved and no longer
entitled to exercise any of the powers or functions of a town.
    In Cass, Itasca, and St. Louis Counties, before the dissolution is effective the voters of the town
shall express their approval or disapproval. The town clerk shall, upon a petition signed by a majority
of the registered voters of the town, filed with the clerk at least 60 days before a regular or special
town election, give notice at the same time and in the same manner of the election that the question
of dissolution of the town will be submitted for determination at the election. At the election the
question shall be voted upon by a separate ballot, the terms of which shall be either "for dissolution"
or "against dissolution." The ballot shall be deposited in a separate ballot box and the result of the
voting canvassed, certified, and returned in the same manner and at the same time as other facts and
returns of the election. If a majority of the votes cast at the election are for dissolution, the town
shall be dissolved. If a majority of the votes cast at the election are against dissolution, the town
shall not be dissolved.
    When a town is dissolved under sections 368.47 to 368.49 the county shall acquire title to any
telephone company or other business conducted by the town. The business shall be operated by the
board of county commissioners until it can be sold. The subscribers or patrons of the business shall
have the first opportunity of purchase. If the town has any outstanding indebtedness chargeable to

year formulate and file a budget in accordance with the budget procedure of the city in the same
manner as required of executive departments of the city or, if no budgets are required to be filed, by

   Sec. 73. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.034, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. General obligation revenue bonds. (a) An authority may pledge the general obligation
of the general jurisdiction governmental unit as additional security for bonds payable from income
or revenues of the project or the authority. The authority must find that the pledged revenues will
equal or exceed 110 percent of the principal and interest due on the bonds for each year. The proceeds
of the bonds must be used for a qualified housing development project or projects. The obligations
must be issued and sold in the manner and following the procedures provided by chapter 475, except
the obligations are not subject to approval by the electors, and the maturities may extend to not more
than 35 years for obligations sold to finance housing for the elderly and 40 years for other obligations
issued under this subdivision. The authority is the municipality for purposes of chapter 475.
    (b) The principal amount of the issue must be approved by the governing body of the general
jurisdiction governmental unit whose general obligation is pledged. Public hearings must be held on
issuance of the obligations by both the authority and the general jurisdiction governmental unit. The
92ND DAY]                           FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012                                         4887

hearings must be held at least 15 days, but not more than 120 days, before the sale of the obligations.
    (c) The maximum amount of general obligation bonds that may be issued and outstanding under
this section equals the greater of (1) one-half of one percent of the ­a
                                                                      t­x­­

the general jurisdiction governmental unit whose general obligation is pledged, or (2) $3,000,000. In
the case of county or multicounty general obligation bonds, the outstanding general obligation bonds
of all cities in the county or counties issued under this subdivision must be added in calculating the
limit under clause (1).
    (d) "General jurisdiction governmental unit" means the city in which the housing development
project is located. In the case of a county or multicounty authority, the county or counties may act
as the general jurisdiction governmental unit. In the case of a multicounty authority, the pledge of
the general obligation is a pledge of a tax on the taxable property in each of the counties.
    (e) "Qualified housing development project" means a housing development project providing
housing either for the elderly or for individuals and families with incomes not greater than 80
percent of the median family income as estimated by the United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development for the standard metropolitan statistical area or the nonmetropolitan county in
which the project is located. The project must be owned for the term of the bonds either by the
authority or by a limited partnership or other entity in which the authority or another entity under
the sole control of the authority is the sole general partner and the partnership or other entity must
receive (1) an allocation from the Department of Management and Budget or an entitlement issuer
of tax-exempt bonding authority for the project and a preliminary determination by the Minnesota
Housing Finance Agency or the applicable suballocator of tax credits that the project will qualify
for four percent low-income housing tax credits or (2) a reservation of nine percent low-income
housing tax credits from the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency or a suballocator of tax credits for
the project. A qualified housing development project may admit nonelderly individuals and families
with higher incomes if:
   (1) three years have passed since initial occupancy;
    (2) the authority finds the project is experiencing unanticipated vacancies resulting in insufficient
revenues, because of changes in population or other unforeseen circumstances that occurred after
the initial finding of adequate revenues; and
    (3) the authority finds a tax levy or payment from general assets of the general jurisdiction
governmental unit will be necessary to pay debt service on the bonds if higher income individuals
or families are not admitted.
    (f) The authority may issue bonds to refund bonds issued under this subdivision in accordance
with section 475.67. The finding of the adequacy of pledged revenues required by paragraph (a) and
the public hearing required by paragraph (b) shall not apply to the issuance of refunding bonds. This
paragraph applies to refunding bonds issued on and after July 1, 1992.

   Sec. 78. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.177, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Original net tax capacity. (a) Upon or after adoption of a tax increment financing
plan, the auditor of any county in which the district is situated shall, upon request of the authority,
certify the original net tax capacity of the tax increment financing district and that portion of the
district overlying any subdistrict as described in the tax increment financing plan and shall certify in
each year thereafter the amount by which the original net tax capacity has increased or decreased as
a result of a change in tax exempt status of property within the district and any subdistrict, reduction
or enlargement of the district or changes pursuant to subdivision 4. The auditor shall certify the
amount within 30 days after receipt of the request and sufficient information to identify the parcels
included in the district. The certification relates to the taxes payable year as provided in subdivision
6.
    (b) If the classification under section 273.13 of property located in a district changes to a
classification that has a different assessment ratio, the original net tax capacity of that property
must be redetermined at the time when its use is changed as if the property had originally been
classified in the same class in which it is classified after its use is changed.
    (c) The amount to be added to the original net tax capacity of the district as a result of previously
tax exempt real property within the district becoming taxable equals the net tax capacity of the
real property as most recently assessed pursuant to section 273.18 or, if that assessment was made
more than one year prior to the date of title transfer rendering the property taxable, the net tax
capacity assessed by the assessor at the time of the transfer. If improvements are made to tax exempt
property after the municipality approves the district and before the parcel becomes taxable, the
92ND DAY]                            FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012                                         4889

assessor shall, at the request of the authority, separately assess the estimated market value of the
improvements. If the property becomes taxable, the county auditor shall add to original net tax
capacity, the net tax capacity of the parcel, excluding the separately assessed improvements. If
substantial taxable improvements were made to a parcel after certification of the district and if the
property later becomes tax exempt, in whole or part, as a result of the authority acquiring the property
through foreclosure or exercise of remedies under a lease or other revenue agreement or as a result
of tax forfeiture, the amount to be added to the original net tax capacity of the district as a result
of the property again becoming taxable is the amount of the parcel's value that was included in
original net tax capacity when the parcel was first certified. The amount to be added to the original
net tax capacity of the district as a result of enlargements equals the net tax capacity of the added real
property as most recently certified by the commissioner of revenue as of the date of modification of
the tax increment financing plan pursuant to section 469.175, subdivision 4.
    (d) If the net tax capacity of a property increases because the property no longer qualifies under
the Minnesota Agricultural Property Tax Law, section 273.111; the Minnesota Open Space Property
Tax Law, section 273.112; or the Metropolitan Agricultural Preserves Act, chapter 473H, or because
platted, unimproved property is improved or market value is increased after approval of the plat
under section 273.11, subdivision 1  ­4­­

                                             ­ or 14b, the increase in net tax capacity must be added to
the original net tax capacity. If the net tax capacity of a property increases because the property no
longer qualifies for the homestead market value exclusion under section 273.13, subdivision 35, the
increase in net tax capacity must be added to the original net tax capacity if the original construction
of the affected home was completed before the date the assessor certified the original net tax capacity
of the district.
    (e) The amount to be subtracted from the original net tax capacity of the district as a result of
previously taxable real property within the district becoming tax exempt or qualifying in whole or
part for an exclusion from taxable market value, or a reduction in the geographic area of the district,
shall be the amount of original net tax capacity initially attributed to the property becoming tax
exempt, being excluded from taxable market value, or being removed from the district. If the net
tax capacity of property located within the tax increment financing district is reduced by reason
of a court-ordered abatement, stipulation agreement, voluntary abatement made by the assessor or
auditor or by order of the commissioner of revenue, the reduction shall be applied to the original
net tax capacity of the district when the property upon which the abatement is made has not been
improved since the date of certification of the district and to the captured net tax capacity of the
district in each year thereafter when the abatement relates to improvements made after the date
of certification. The county auditor may specify reasonable form and content of the request for
certification of the authority and any modification thereof pursuant to section 469.175, subdivision
4.
    (f) If a parcel of property contained a substandard building or improvements described in section
469.174, subdivision 10, paragraph (e), that were demolished or removed and if the authority elects
to treat the parcel as occupied by a substandard building under section 469.174, subdivision 10,
paragraph (b), or by improvements under section 469.174, subdivision 10, paragraph (e), the auditor
shall certify the original net tax capacity of the parcel using the greater of (1) the current net tax
capacity of the parcel, or (2) the estimated market value of the parcel for the year in which the
building or other improvements were demolished or removed, but applying the class rates for the
current year.

    (g) For a redevelopment district qualifying under section 469.174, subdivision 10, paragraph (a),
clause (4), as a qualified disaster area, the auditor shall certify the value of the land as the original
tax capacity for any parcel in the district that contains a building that suffered substantial damage
as a result of the disaster or emergency.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies
to all districts, regardless of when the request for certification was made, and to computation
of increment beginning with taxes payable in 2013, provided that the adjustments to original
tax capacity required by this section apply only to exclusions that reduced taxable market value
beginning with taxes payable in 2012 or thereafter, regardless of when the law authorizing the
exclusions became effective.

   Sec. 81. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.206, is amended to read:
   469.206 HAZARDOUS PROPERTY PENALTY.
    A city may assess a penalty up to one percent of the estimated market value of real property,
including any building located within the city that the city determines to be hazardous as defined
in section 463.15, subdivision 3. The city shall send a written notice to the address to which the
property tax statement is sent at least 90 days before it may assess the penalty. If the owner of the
property has not paid the penalty or fixed the property within 90 days after receiving notice of the
penalty, the penalty is considered delinquent and is increased by 25 percent each 60 days the penalty
is not paid and the property remains hazardous. For the purposes of this section, a penalty that is

amount included for operation and maintenance shall not exceed an amount which, when extended
against the property taxable therefor under section 473.621, subdivision 5, will require a levy at a
rate of 0.00806 percent of estimated market value. Taxes levied by the corporation shall not affect
the amount or rate of taxes which may be levied by any other local government unit within the
metropolitan area under the provisions of any charter.
     Sec. 89. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 473.667, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Additional taxes. Nothing herein shall prevent the commission from levying a tax
not to exceed 0.00121 percent of estimated market value on taxable property within its taxing
jurisdiction, in addition to any levies found necessary for the debt service fund authorized by section
473.671. Nothing herein shall prevent the levy and appropriation for purposes of the commission
of any other tax on property or on any income, transaction, or privilege, when and if authorized by
law. All collections of any taxes so levied shall be included in the revenues appropriated for the
purposes referred to in this section, unless otherwise provided in the law authorizing the levies; but
no covenant as to the continuance or as to the rate and amount of any such levy shall be made with
the holders of the commission's bonds unless specifically authorized by law.

     Sec. 90. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 473.671, is amended to read:

or interest on any bonds or indebtedness of the city issued under Laws 1943, chapter 500, and
exclusive of any taxes levied to pay the share of the city for payments on bonded indebtedness of
the corporation provided for in Laws 1943, chapter 500. The levy of taxes authorized in Laws 1943,
chapter 500, shall be in addition to the maximum rate allowed to be levied to defray the cost of
government under the provisions of the charter of any city affected by Laws 1943, chapter 500.
     Sec. 91. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 473.711, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Tax levy. (a) The commission may levy a tax on all taxable property in the district as
defined in section 473.702 to provide funds for the purposes of sections 473.701 to 473.716. The
tax shall not exceed the property tax levy limitation determined in this subdivision. A participating
county may agree to levy an additional tax to be used by the commission for the purposes of sections
473.701 to 473.716 but the sum of the county's and commission's taxes may not exceed the county's
proportionate share of the property tax levy limitation determined under this subdivision based on
the ratio of its total net tax capacity to the total net tax capacity of the entire district as adjusted by
section 270.12, subdivision 3. The auditor of each county in the district shall add the amount of the
levy made by the district to other taxes of the county for collection by the county treasurer with other
taxes. When collected, the county treasurer shall make settlement of the tax with the district in the
same manner as other taxes are distributed to political subdivisions. No county shall levy any tax
for mosquito, disease vectoring tick, and black gnat (Simuliidae) control except under this section.
The levy shall be in addition to other taxes authorized by law.
    (b) The property tax levied by the Metropolitan Mosquito Control Commission shall not exceed
the product of (i) the commission's property tax levy limitation for the previous year determined
under this subdivision multiplied by (ii) an index for market valuation changes equal to the total
estimated market v  ­­

of its estimated market value may issue bonds under this subdivision for the purpose of funding or
refunding such indebtedness or any part thereof. A list of the items of indebtedness to be funded or

newspaper published in the municipality or if there be no such newspaper, in a legal newspaper
published in the county seat. Such bonds may be issued without the submission of the question
of their issue to the electors unless within ten days after the second publication of the resolution a

hereunder unless authorized by a majority of the electors voting on the question.

    (1) name; employee identification number, which must not be the employee's Social Security
number; actual gross salary; salary range; terms and conditions of employment relationship; contract

prospective witness as part of the government entity's investigation of any complaint or charge

or charge against a public official, or if a public official resigns or is terminated from employment
while the complaint or charge is pending, all data relating to the complaint or charge are public,
unless access to the data would jeopardize an active investigation or reveal confidential sources.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for contracts let on or after July 1, 2012.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 161.321, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2a. Veteran-owned small business set-asides. (a) The commissioner must award up to
a six percent preference in the amount bid for specified construction work to veteran-owned small
businesses, except when prohibited by the federal government as a condition of receiving federal
funds. The percentage of preference in bid amount provided under this subdivision may not be
less than the percentage of bid preference provided to any small targeted group business under
subdivision 2.
    (b) The commissioner must be as inclusive as possible in specifying contracts for construction
work, as well as for construction-related professional and technical services, available under this
bid preference program for veteran-owned small businesses. The term "construction" must be given
broad meaning for purposes of specifying and letting contracts for veteran-owned small businesses
and must include, but is not limited to, preplanning, planning, and all other construction-related
professional and technical services.
   (c) The commissioner must strive to ensure that contracts under this subdivision will be awarded
on a proportional basis with contracts awarded under subdivision 2.
    (d) The commissioner, as a condition of awarding a construction contract, must set goals
that require the prime contractor to subcontract a portion of the contract to veteran-owned small
businesses, except when prohibited by federal law or rule as a condition of receiving federal
funds. The commissioner must establish a procedure for granting waivers from the subcontracting
requirement when qualified veteran-owned small businesses are not reasonably available. The
commissioner may establish financial incentives for prime contractors who exceed the goals for use
of veteran-owned small business subcontractors, as well as financial penalties for prime contractors
who have not been granted a waiver and fail to meet goals under this paragraph. The subcontracting
requirements of this paragraph do not apply to prime contractors who are veteran-owned small
businesses.
    (e) The commissioner may designate a contract for construction work for award only to
veteran-owned small businesses, if the commissioner determines that at least three veteran-owned
small businesses are likely to bid.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for contracts let on or after July 1, 2012."

   (a) $15,000,000 shall be appropriated annually to the Office of the Secretary of State to reimburse
any county, school district, statutory or home rule charter city, or town for any expense directly
associated with implementing this amendment for any state, federal, or local primary, general, or
special election. Expenses eligible for reimbursement include, but are not limited to, the following:
   (1) payment to election judges who would not have been hired but for implementation needs;
    (2) the cost of printing, purchasing, or copying any ballot, ballot envelope, ballot instructions,
or other documents required in addition to normal election materials;
   (3) the purchase of any special ballot box or other means of securing provisional ballots;
    (4) compensation to election officials and election judges for processing provisional ballots,
including any time in addition to regularly scheduled business hours needed to process or be
available to process such ballots, including being available for a voter to prove identity; and
   (5) any other cost the eligible jurisdiction can show would not have been incurred but for the
requirement to implement this amendment.
    (b) To be eligible for reimbursement, a qualifying entity shall submit to the Office of the
Secretary of State copies of documentation, including, but not limited to, receipts and payroll
records, demonstrating the actual costs of implementing this amendment. The secretary shall deny
any claim for which adequate documentation is not provided, but shall first provide the requesting
jurisdiction with notice of the intent to deny the basis of the denial, and 30 days to submit additional
requested documentation.
    (c) If in any year the amount appropriated is insufficient to fully reimburse all requesting
jurisdictions, the secretary of state shall honor reimbursement requests on a proportional basis
and certify the amount of the shortfall to the Department of Revenue. The following year's
appropriation shall be increased by the amount of the shortfall."

registration application by mail and have not voted in a federal election in this state.
    (e) The county auditor shall compile a list of voters for whom the county auditor and the
secretary of state are unable to conclude that information on the voter registration application and
the corresponding information in the Department of Public Safety database relate to the same
person.
    (f) The county auditor shall send a notice of incomplete registration to any voter whose name
appears on the list and change the voter's status to "incomplete." A voter who receives a notice
of incomplete registration from the county auditor may either provide the information required to
complete the registration at least 21 days before the next election or at the polling place on election
day.
    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 201.161, is amended to read:
    201.161 DRIVER'S LICENSE AND IDENTIFICATION CARD APPLICATIONS.
    The Department of Public Safety shall change its applications for an original, duplicate, or
change of address driver's license or identification card so that the forms may also serve as voter
registration applications. The forms must contain spaces for all information collected by voter
registration applications prescribed by the secretary of state. Applicants for driver's licenses
or identification cards must be asked if they want to register to vote at the same time and that
information must be transmitted at least weekly by electronic means to the secretary of state.
Pursuant to the Help America Vote Act of 2002, Public Law 107-252, the computerized driver's
license record containing the voter's name, address, date of birth, photograph, driver's license
number or state identification number, county, town, and city must be made available for access by
the secretary of state and interaction with the statewide voter registration system.
    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 201.221, subdivision 3, is amended to read:

district number, and space for the voter's signature. The secretary of state may prescribe additional
election-related information to be placed on the polling place rosters on an experimental basis for
one state primary and general election cycle; the same information may not be placed on the polling
place roster for a second state primary and general election cycle unless specified in this subdivision.
The polling place roster must be used to indicate whether the voter has voted in a given election.
The secretary of state shall prescribe procedures for transporting the polling place rosters to the
election judges for use on election day. The secretary of state shall prescribe the form for a county or
municipality to request the date of birth from currently registered voters. The county or municipality
shall not request the date of birth from currently registered voters by any communication other than
the prescribed form and the form must clearly indicate that a currently registered voter does not lose
registration status by failing to provide the date of birth. In accordance with section 204B.40, the
county auditor shall retain the prescribed polling place rosters used on the date of election for 22
months following the election.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 204C.10, is amended to read:
   204C.10 PERMANENT REGISTRATION; VERIFICATION OF REGISTRATION.
    (a) An individual seeking to vote shall sign a polling place roster which states that the individual
is at least 18 years of age, a citizen of the United States, has resided in Minnesota for 20 days
immediately preceding the election, maintains residence at the address shown, is not under a
guardianship in which the court order revokes the individual's right to vote, has not been found by a
court of law to be legally incompetent to vote or has the right to vote because, if the individual was
convicted of a felony, the felony sentence has expired or been completed or the individual has been
discharged from the sentence, is registered and has not already voted in the election. The roster
must also state: "I understand that deliberately providing false information is a felony punishable
by not more than five years imprisonment and a fine of not more than $10,000, or both."
    (b) A judge may, before the applicant signs the roster, confirm the applicant's name, address,
and date of birth, and verify that the applicant appears to be the same individual whose photograph
is associated with that voter record in the polling place roster. If two or more election judges of
different major political parties do not believe that the voter is the same person as the person depicted
in the photograph associated with the voter's record, the voter must certify that the voter is the person
who is registered to vote and the judge must take a photograph of the voter. If a photograph is not
associated with the applicant's record in the roster, the voter may present a Minnesota driver's license
or identification card to the judge, who shall record the number so that a photograph can be attached
to the voter's record. Otherwise, the judge must request that the applicant allow the judge to take a
color photograph of the applicant for inclusion in the statewide voter registration system and polling
place roster. Refusal of an applicant to consent to a photograph for religious reasons must be noted
on the incident log, but does not prohibit the applicant from casting a ballot.
    (c) The secretary of state may send a letter to a voter if there is not a Minnesota driver's license or
state identification card number associated with the voter's record to request that the voter provide
this number, if the voter has a Minnesota driver's license or state identification card.

      ) (d) After the applicant signs the roster, the judge shall give the applicant a voter's receipt.
The voter shall deliver the voter's receipt to the judge in charge of ballots as proof of the voter's
right to vote, and thereupon the judge shall hand to the voter the ballot. The voters' receipts must be
maintained during the time for notice of filing an election contest.

   (2) ultimate interest rate assumptions
    Once, after July 1, 2014, the geometric average dollar weighted rate of return for a ten fiscal
year period, as calculated by the approved actuary retained by the applicable retirement system
or plan and disclosed in the actuarial valuation under this section, indicates that the investment
performance of the applicable retirement plan equals or exceeds 8.5 percent, beginning July 1 of the
calendar year next following the date on which the actuarial valuation containing that result is filed
with the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement, the ultimate interest rate actuarial
assumptions for that retirement plan are as follows:

    Subd. 11. Amortization contributions. (a) In addition to the exhibit indicating the level normal
cost, the actuarial valuation of the retirement plan must contain an exhibit for financial reporting
purposes indicating the additional annual contribution sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial
accrued liability and must contain an exhibit for contribution determination purposes indicating
the additional contribution sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability. For the
retirement plans listed in subdivision 8, paragraph (c), but excluding the MERF division of the Public
Employees Retirement Association and the legislators retirement plan, the additional contribution
must be calculated on a level percentage of covered payroll basis by the established date for full
funding in effect when the valuation is prepared, assuming annual payroll growth at the applicable
percentage rate set forth in subdivision 8, paragraph (c). For all other retirement plans and for the
MERF division of the Public Employees Retirement Association and the legislators retirement plan,
the additional annual contribution must be calculated on a level annual dollar amount basis.
    (b) For any retirement plan other than the general state employees retirement plan of the
Minnesota State Retirement System or a retirement plan governed by paragraph (d), (e), (f), (g),
(h), (i), or (j), if there has not been a change in the actuarial assumptions used for calculating the
actuarial accrued liability of the fund, a change in the benefit plan governing annuities and benefits
payable from the fund, a change in the actuarial cost method used in calculating the actuarial
accrued liability of all or a portion of the fund, or a combination of the three, which change or
changes by itself or by themselves without inclusion of any other items of increase or decrease
produce a net increase in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the fund, the established date
for full funding is the first actuarial valuation date occurring after June 1, 2020.
    (c) For any retirement plan other than the general employees retirement plan of the Public
Employees Retirement Association, if there has been a change in any or all of the actuarial
assumptions used for calculating the actuarial accrued liability of the fund, a change in the benefit
plan governing annuities and benefits payable from the fund, a change in the actuarial cost method
used in calculating the actuarial accrued liability of all or a portion of the fund, or a combination of
the three, and the change or changes, by itself or by themselves and without inclusion of any other
items of increase or decrease, produce a net increase in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability in
the fund, the established date for full funding must be determined using the following procedure:
   (i) the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the fund must be determined in accordance with the
plan provisions governing annuities and retirement benefits and the actuarial assumptions in effect
before an applicable change;
    (ii) the level annual dollar contribution or level percentage, whichever is applicable, needed
to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount determined under item (i) by the
established date for full funding in effect before the change must be calculated using the interest
assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect before the change;
    (iii) the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the fund must be determined in accordance with
any new plan provisions governing annuities and benefits payable from the fund and any new
actuarial assumptions and the remaining plan provisions governing annuities and benefits payable
from the fund and actuarial assumptions in effect before the change;
    (iv) the level annual dollar contribution or level percentage, whichever is applicable, needed to
amortize the difference between the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount calculated under
item (i) and the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount calculated under item (iii) over a period

of 30 years from the end of the plan year in which the applicable change is effective must be
calculated using the applicable interest assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect after any
applicable change;
     (v) the level annual dollar or level percentage amortization contribution under item (iv) must be
added to the level annual dollar amortization contribution or level percentage calculated under item
(ii);
    (vi) the period in which the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount determined in item (iii)
is amortized by the total level annual dollar or level percentage amortization contribution computed
under item (v) must be calculated using the interest assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect
after any applicable change, rounded to the nearest integral number of years, but not to exceed
30 years from the end of the plan year in which the determination of the established date for full
funding using the procedure set forth in this clause is made and not to be less than the period of
years beginning in the plan year in which the determination of the established date for full funding
using the procedure set forth in this clause is made and ending by the date for full funding in effect
before the change; and
   (vii) the period determined under item (vi) must be added to the date as of which the actuarial
valuation was prepared and the date obtained is the new established date for full funding.
    (d) For the MERF division of the Public Employees Retirement Association, the established
date for full funding is June 30, 2031.
    (e) For the general employees retirement plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association,
the established date for full funding is June 30, 2031.
   (f) For the Teachers Retirement Association, the established date for full funding is June 30,
2037.

System, the established date for full funding is June 30, 2038.
   (h) For the judges retirement plan, the established date for full funding is June 30, 2038.
    (i) For the public employees police and fire retirement plan, the established date for full funding
is June 30, 2038.
    (j) For the St. Paul Teachers Retirement Fund Association, the established date for full funding
is June 30 of the 25th year from the valuation date. In addition to other requirements of this chapter,
the annual actuarial valuation must contain an exhibit indicating the funded ratio and the deficiency
or sufficiency in annual contributions when comparing liabilities to the market value of the assets
of the fund as of the close of the most recent fiscal year.
    (k) For the general state employees retirement plan of the Minnesota State Retirement System,
the established date for full funding is June 30, 2040.
   (l) For the retirement plans for which the annual actuarial valuation indicates an excess of
valuation assets over the actuarial accrued liability, the valuation assets in excess of the actuarial
accrued liability must be recognized as a reduction in the current contribution requirements by
an amount equal to the amortization of the excess expressed as a level percentage of pay over a

director shall make available a limited range of investment options, and each participant may direct

made available by the executive director.
    (c) This section does not obligate a public employer to meet and negotiate in good faith with
the exclusive bargaining representative of any public employee group regarding an employer
contribution to a postretirement or active employee health care savings plan authorized by this
section and section 356.24, subdivision 1, clause (7). It is not the intent of the legislature to
authorize the state to incur new funding obligations for the costs of retiree health care or the costs
of administering retiree health care plans or accounts.

participants at least quarterly for eligible health-related expenses, as allowable by federal and state
law, until the participant exhausts the accumulation in the participant's account. If a participant
dies prior to exhausting the participant's account balance, the participant's spouse or dependents are
eligible to be reimbursed for health care expenses from the account until the account balance is
exhausted. If an account balance remains after the death of a participant and all of the participant's
legal dependents, the remainder of the account must be paid to the participant's beneficiaries or, if

            PERA-ADMINISTERED RETIREMENT PLAN MODIFICATIONS
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 353.01, subdivision 16, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 16. Allowable service; limits and computation. (a) "Allowable service" means:
   (1) service during years of actual membership in the course of which employee deductions were
withheld from salary and contributions were made at the applicable rates under section 353.27,
353.65, or 353E.03;
   (2) periods of service covered by payments in lieu of salary deductions under sections 353.27,
subdivision 12, and 353.35;
   (3) service in years during which the public employee was not a member but for which the
member later elected, while a member, to obtain credit by making payments to the fund as permitted
by any law then in effect;
   (4) a period of authorized leave of absence with pay from which deductions for employee
contributions are made, deposited, and credited to the fund;
    (5) a period of authorized personal, parental, or medical leave of absence without pay, including
a leave of absence covered under the federal Family Medical Leave Act, that does not exceed one
year, and for which a member obtained service credit for each month in the leave period by payment
under section 353.0161 to the fund made in place of salary deductions. An employee must return to
public service and render a minimum of three months of allowable service in order to be eligible to
make payment under section 353.0161 for a subsequent authorized leave of absence without pay.
Upon payment, the employee must be granted allowable service credit for the purchased period;
    (6) a periodic, repetitive leave that is offered to all employees of a governmental subdivision.
The leave program may not exceed 208 hours per annual normal work cycle as certified to the
association by the employer. A participating member obtains service credit by making employee
contributions in an amount or amounts based on the member's average salary, excluding overtime
pay, that would have been paid if the leave had not been taken. The employer shall pay the employer
and additional employer contributions on behalf of the participating member. The employee and
the employer are responsible to pay interest on their respective shares at the rate of 8.5 percent
a year, compounded annually, from the end of the normal cycle until full payment is made. An
employer shall also make the employer and additional employer contributions, plus 8.5 percent
interest, compounded annually, on behalf of an employee who makes employee contributions but
terminates public service. The employee contributions must be made within one year after the
end of the annual normal working cycle or within 30 days after termination of public service,
whichever is sooner. The executive director shall prescribe the manner and forms to be used by a
governmental subdivision in administering a periodic, repetitive leave. Upon payment, the member
must be granted allowable service credit for the purchased period;
    (7) an authorized temporary or seasonal layoff under subdivision 12, limited to three months
allowable service per authorized temporary or seasonal layoff in one calendar year. An employee
92ND DAY]                           FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012                                        4965

who has received the maximum service credit allowed for an authorized temporary or seasonal
layoff must return to public service and must obtain a minimum of three months of allowable service
subsequent to the layoff in order to receive allowable service for a subsequent authorized temporary
or seasonal layoff;
    (8) a period during which a member is absent from employment by a governmental subdivision
by reason of service in the uniformed services, as defined in United States Code, title 38, section
4303(13), if the member returns to public service with the same governmental subdivision upon
discharge from service in the uniformed service within the time frames required under United States
Code, title 38, section 4312(e), provided that the member did not separate from uniformed service
with a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge or under other than honorable conditions. The service
must be credited if the member pays into the fund equivalent employee contributions based upon the
contribution rate or rates in effect at the time that the uniformed service was performed multiplied
by the full and fractional years being purchased and applied to the annual salary rate. The annual
salary rate is the average annual salary, excluding overtime pay, during the purchase period that the
member would have received if the member had continued to be employed in covered employment
rather than to provide uniformed service, or, if the determination of that rate is not reasonably
certain, the annual salary rate is the member's average salary rate, excluding overtime pay, during
the 12-month period of covered employment rendered immediately preceding the period of the
uniformed service. Payment of the member equivalent contributions must be made during a period
that begins with the date on which the individual returns to public employment and that is three times
the length of the military leave period, or within five years of the date of discharge from the military
service, whichever is less. If the determined payment period is less than one year, the contributions
required under this clause to receive service credit may be made within one year of the discharge
date. Payment may not be accepted following 30 days after termination of public service under
subdivision 11a. If the member equivalent contributions provided for in this clause are not paid in
full, the member's allowable service credit must be prorated by multiplying the full and fractional
number of years of uniformed service eligible for purchase by the ratio obtained by dividing the
total member contributions received by the total member contributions otherwise required under this
clause. The equivalent employer contribution, and, if applicable, the equivalent additional employer
contribution must be paid by the governmental subdivision employing the member if the member
makes the equivalent employee contributions. The employer payments must be made from funds
available to the employing unit, using the employer and additional employer contribution rate or
rates in effect at the time that the uniformed service was performed, applied to the same annual salary
rate or rates used to compute the equivalent member contribution. The governmental subdivision
involved may appropriate money for those payments. The amount of service credit obtainable under
this section may not exceed five years unless a longer purchase period is required under United States
Code, title 38, section 4312. The employing unit shall pay interest on all equivalent member and
employer contribution amounts payable under this clause. Interest must be computed at a rate of 8.5
percent compounded annually from the end of each fiscal year of the leave or the break in service
to the end of the month in which the payment is received. Upon payment, the employee must be
granted allowable service credit for the purchased period; or

   (b) For calculating benefits under sections 353.30, 353.31, 353.32, and 353.33 for state officers
and employees displaced by the Community Corrections Act, chapter 401, and transferred into
county service under section 401.04, "allowable service" means the combined years of allowable

service as defined in paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (6), and section 352.01, subdivision 11.
    (c) For a public employee who has prior service covered by a local police or firefighters relief
association that has consolidated with the Public Employees Retirement Association under chapter
353A or to which section 353.665 applies, and who has elected the type of benefit coverage
provided by the public employees police and fire fund either under section 353A.08 following
the consolidation or under section 353.665, subdivision 4, "allowable service" is a period of
service credited by the local police or firefighters relief association as of the effective date of the
consolidation based on law and on bylaw provisions governing the relief association on the date
of the initiation of the consolidation procedure.
    (d) No member may receive more than 12 months of allowable service credit in a year either
for vesting purposes or for benefit calculation purposes. For an active member who was an
active member of the former Minneapolis Firefighters Relief Association on the day prior to the
effective date of consolidation under Laws 2011, First Special Session chapter 8, article 6, section
19, "allowable service" is the period of service credited by the Minneapolis Firefighters Relief
Association as reflected in the transferred records of the association up to the effective date of
consolidation under Laws 2011, First Special Session chapter 8, article 6, section 19, and the
period of service credited under paragraph (a), clause (1), after the effective date of consolidation
under Laws 2011, First Special Session chapter 8, article 6, section 19. For an active member
who was an active member of the former Minneapolis Police Relief Association on the day prior
to the effective date of consolidation under Laws 2011, First Special Session chapter 8, article 7,
section 19, "allowable service" is the period of service credited by the Minneapolis Police Relief
Association as reflected in the transferred records of the association up to the effective date of
consolidation under Laws 2011, First Special Session chapter 8, article 7, section 19, and the period
of service credited under paragraph (a), clause (1), after the effective date of consolidation under
Laws 2011, First Special Session chapter 8, article 7, section 19.

   Subd. 47. Vesting. (a) "Vesting" means obtaining a nonforfeitable entitlement to an annuity or
benefit from a retirement plan administered by the Public Employees Retirement Association by
having credit for sufficient allowable service under paragraph (b) or (c), whichever applies.

    (b) An active member covered by the MERF division must make an employee contribution of
9.75 percent of the total salary of the member as defined in section 353.01, subdivision 10. The

7b, 12, 12a, and 12b.
   (c) The employer regular contribution to the MERF division account with respect to an active
MERF division member is 9.75 percent of the total salary of the member as defined in section
353.01, subdivision 10.
    (d) The employer additional contribution to the MERF division account with respect to an active
member of the MERF division is 2.68 percent of the total salary of the member as defined in section

    (2) the amount of $27,000,000, but the total supplemental contribution amount plus the
contributions under paragraphs (c) and (d) may not exceed $34,000,000. Each employing unit's

the Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund board.
    (f) Before January 31, each employing unit must be invoiced for its share of the total employer
supplemental contribution amount under paragraph (e). The amount is payable by the employing
unit in two parts. The first half of the amount due is payable on or before the July 31 following
the date of the invoice, and the second half of the amount due is payable on or before December
15. Each invoice must be based on the actuarial valuation report prepared under section 356.215

    (b) This paragraph applies if the legislation adding the medical facility or other employing unit
to section 353F.02, subdivision 4 or 5, as applicable, was enacted before July 26, 2005, and became
effective before January 1, 2008, for the Hutchinson Area Health Care or before January 1, 2007,
for all other medical facilities and all other employing units. For a terminated medical facility or
other public employing unit employee, the augmentation rate is 5.5 percent compounded annually
until January 1 following the year in which the person attains age 55. From that date to the effective
date of retirement, the augmentation rate is 7.5 percent compounded annually.
    (c) If paragraph (b) is not applicable, and if the effective date of the privatization is before January
1, 2011, the augmentation rate is four percent compounded annually until January 1, following
the year in which the person attains age 55. From that date to the effective date of retirement, the
augmentation rate is six percent compounded annually.
    (d) If the effective date of the privatization is after December 31, 2010, the applicable
augmentation rate depends on the result of computations specified in section 353F.025, subdivision
1. If those computations indicate no loss or a net gain to the fund of the general employees
retirement plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association, the augmentation rate is 2.0
percent compounded annually until the effective date of retirement. If the computations under that
subdivision indicate a net loss to the fund if a 2.0 percent augmentation rate is used, but a net
gain or no loss if a 1.0 percent rate is used, then the augmentation rate is 1.0 percent compounded
annually until the effective date of retirement.
    (e) The term "effective date of the privatization" as used in this subdivision means the "effective
date" as defined in section 353F.02, subdivision 3.

Association as the district's share of the contribution requirement in excess of the maximum state
contribution under section 353.505.
   (b) For taxes payable in 1994 and thereafter, Special School District No. 1, Minneapolis, and
Independent School District No. 625, St. Paul, may levy for the increase in the employer retirement
fund contributions, under Laws 1992, chapter 598, article 5, section 1.

increased for fiscal year 1994 or later fiscal years, Special School District No. 1, Minneapolis, and
Independent School District No. 625, St. Paul, may levy in payable 1994 or later an amount equal to
the amount derived by applying the net increase in the employer retirement fund contribution rate
of the respective teacher retirement fund association between fiscal year 1993 and the fiscal year
beginning in the year after the levy is certified to the total covered payroll of the applicable teacher
retirement fund association. If an applicable school district levies under this paragraph, they may
not levy under paragraph (b).
    (d) In addition to the levy authorized under paragraph (c), Special School District No. 1,

  Sec. 3. [354.435] ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS BY SPECIAL SCHOOL DISTRICT
NO. 1 AND CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS.
    Subdivision 1. Special direct state matching aid. (a) Special School District No. 1,
Minneapolis, and the city of Minneapolis must make additional employer contributions to the
Teachers Retirement Association in the amounts specified in paragraph (b). These contributions
can be made from any available source. If made in whole or in part by a levy, the levy may be
classified as that of a special taxing district for purposes of sections 275.065 and 276.04, and for
all other property tax purposes.
    (b) Each fiscal year $1,250,000 must be contributed by Special School District No. 1,
Minneapolis, and $1,250,000 must be contributed by the city of Minneapolis to the Teachers
Retirement Association and the state shall match this total by paying to the Teachers Retirement
Association $2,500,000. The superintendent of Special School District No. 1, Minneapolis, the
mayor of the city of Minneapolis, and the executive director of the Teachers Retirement Association
shall jointly certify to the commissioner of management and budget the total amount that has
been contributed by Special School District No. 1, Minneapolis, and by the city of Minneapolis to
the Teachers Retirement Association. Any certification to the commissioner of management and
budget must be made quarterly. If the certifications for a fiscal year exceed the maximum annual
direct state matching aid amount in any quarter, the amount of direct state matching aid payable
to the Teachers Retirement Association must be limited to the balance of the maximum annual
direct state matching aid amount available. The amount required under this paragraph, subject to
the maximum direct state matching aid amount, is appropriated annually to the commissioner of
management and budget.
   (c) The commissioner of management and budget may prescribe the form of the certifications
required under paragraph (b).
   Subd. 2. Additional contributions. In addition to any other required contributions, on or before
June 30 each fiscal year, Special School District No. 1, Minneapolis, and the city of Minneapolis
must each make an additional contribution to the Teachers Retirement Association of $1,000,000.
    Subd. 3. Procedure for recovery of deficient or delinquent amounts. If Special School District
No. 1, Minneapolis, or the city of Minneapolis fails to pay the full amount required under subdivision
1, paragraph (b), or 2, in a timely manner, the executive director is authorized to use section 354.512,
or any other process in law to ensure full payment is obtained.
    Subd. 4. Expiration. This section expires effective the first day of the fiscal year next following
the fiscal year in which the Teachers Retirement Association has no unfunded actuarial accrued
liability as determined by the actuarial valuation prepared under section 356.215 by the approved
actuary retained under section 356.214.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 354.51, subdivision 5, is amended to read:

July 1, 1981, may be made any time before retirement. Payment must include interest at an annual
rate of 8.5 percent compounded annually from the end of the fiscal year in which the shortage
occurred to the end of the month in which payment is made and the interest must be credited to the
fund. If payment of a shortage in deductions is not made, the formula service credit of the member
must be prorated under section 354.05, subdivision 25, clause (3).
     (2) Payment of shortages in member deductions on salary earned after June 30, 1981, are the
sole obligation of the employing unit and are payable by the employing unit upon notification by
the executive director of the shortage with interest at an annual rate of 8.5 percent compounded
annually from the end of the fiscal year in which the shortage occurred to the end of the month
in which payment is made and the interest must be credited to the fund. Effective July 1, 1986, the
employing unit shall also pay the employer contributions as specified in section 354.42, subdivisions
3 and 5 for the shortages. If the shortage payment is not paid by the employing unit within 60 days
of notification, and if the executive director does not use the recovery procedure in section 354.512,

residential mortgages, not in default, that has previously been financed by the issuance of bonds or
notes of the agency. The state board may also enter into a commitment with the agency, at the time
of any issue of bonds or notes, to purchase at a specified future date, not exceeding 12 years from the
date of the issue, the amount of mortgage loans then outstanding and not in default that have been
made or purchased from the proceeds of the bonds or notes. The state board may charge reasonable
fees for any such commitment and may agree to purchase the mortgage loans at a price sufficient
to produce a yield to the state board comparable, in its judgment, to the yield available on similar
mortgage loans at the date of the bonds or notes. The state board may also enter into agreements
with the agency for the investment of any portion of the funds of the agency. The agreement must
cover the period of the investment, withdrawal privileges, and any guaranteed rate of return.

or any part of a pool of residential mortgages, not in default, that has previously been financed
by the issuance of bonds or notes of the agency. The covered pension plan may also enter into a
commitment with the agency, at the time of any issue of bonds or notes, to purchase at a specified
future date, not exceeding 12 years from the date of the issue, the amount of mortgage loans then
outstanding and not in default that have been made or purchased from the proceeds of the bonds
or notes. The covered pension plan may charge reasonable fees for any such commitment and may
agree to purchase the mortgage loans at a price sufficient to produce a yield to the covered pension
plan comparable, in its judgment, to the yield available on similar mortgage loans at the date of the
bonds or notes. The covered pension plan may also enter into agreements with the agency for the
investment of any portion of the funds of the agency. The agreement must cover the period of the
investment, withdrawal privileges, and any guaranteed rate of return.

    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 69.77, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Relief association financial requirements; minimum municipal obligation. (a) The

and minimum obligation of the municipality for the following calendar year in accordance with
the requirements of this subdivision. The financial requirements of the relief association and the
92ND DAY]                                  FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012                                                    5001

minimum obligation of the municipality must be determined on or before the submission date
established by the municipality under subdivision 5.
    (b) The financial requirements of the relief association for the following calendar year must
be based on the most recent actuarial valuation or survey of the special fund of the association
if more than one fund is maintained by the association, or of the association, if only one fund
is maintained, prepared in accordance with sections 356.215, subdivisions 4 to 15, and 356.216,
as required under subdivision 10. If an actuarial estimate is prepared by the actuary of the relief
association as part of obtaining a modification of the benefit plan of the relief association and the
modification is implemented, the actuarial estimate must be used in calculating the subsequent
financial requirements of the relief association.
    (c) If the relief association has an unfunded actuarial accrued liability as reported in the most
recent actuarial valuation or survey, the total of the amounts calculated under clauses (1), (2), and
(3), constitute the financial requirements of the relief association for the following year. If the relief
association does not have an unfunded actuarial accrued liability as reported in the most recent
actuarial valuation or survey, the amount calculated under clauses (1) and (2) constitute the financial
requirements of the relief association for the following year. The financial requirement elements are:
    (1) the normal level cost requirement for the following year, expressed as a dollar amount, which
must be determined by applying the normal level cost of the relief association as reported in the
actuarial valuation or survey and expressed as a percentage of covered payroll to the estimated
covered payroll of the active membership of the relief association, including any projected change
in the active membership, for the following year;

administrative officer of the Minneapolis Police Relief Association shall transfer the entire assets
of the special fund of the Minneapolis Police Relief Association other than the health insurance
account to the public employees police and fire retirement fund at market value. Unless ineligible
or inappropriate, the transfer must be in the form of investment securities and must include any
accounts receivable that are determined by the State Board of Investment as being capable of
being collected. An amount, in cash, must be transferred by the city of Minneapolis equal to the
market value recognized by the relief association of investment securities that are determined
by the executive director of the State Board of Investment not to be in compliance with the
requirements and limitations set forth in sections 11A.09, 11A.14, 11A.23, and 11A.24 or not to
be appropriate for retention in light of the established investment objectives of the State Board
of Investment or of accounts receivable determined by the executive director of the State Board
of Investment as being incapable of being collected. Legal and beneficial title to assets that are
determined noncompliant or inappropriate securities or that are uncollectible accounts receivable
are transferred to the city of Minneapolis on the effective date of consolidation under Laws 2011,
First Special Session chapter 8, article 7, section 19. Any accounts payable on the effective date
of consolidation under Laws 2011, First Special Session chapter 8, article 7, section 19, are an
obligation of the public employees police and fire retirement fund and reduce the asset value
for purposes of subdivision 6. The transferred assets must be deposited in the public employees
police and fire retirement fund. The amount of the health insurance account as of the date of the
consolidation must remain deposited in the financial institution retained by the former Minneapolis
Police Relief Association on May 1, 2011, and that financial institution must act as the custodian
of the account. The health insurance account may be transferred from the financial institution that
holds the account to a successor financial institution on June 30, 2012, under the requirements of
this subdivision and the terms of an agreement between the Minneapolis Police Relief Association
and the successor financial institution dated December 30, 2011, that provides for the transfer. The
financial institution shall perform all trustee and fiduciary duties with respect to the account as a
condition to the retention of the account. The executive director of the Minneapolis Police Relief
Association, prior to the effective date of consolidation, shall estimate three calendar years of the
administrative expenses related to the operation of the account and shall prepay those expenses
from the account to the financial institution prior to the effective date of consolidation. After the
three-year prepayment period, the beneficiaries of the account are responsible for the payment of

the administrative expenses related to the operation of the account.
    (b) Upon the transfer of assets to the State Board of Investment under paragraph (a), legal title to
those transferred assets vests with the State Board of Investment on behalf of the public employees
police and fire retirement plan, and beneficial title to the transferred assets remains with the former
membership of the former Minneapolis Police Relief Association.
    (c) The public employees police and fire retirement plan and fund is the successor in interest
to all claims for or against the Minneapolis Police Relief Association. The public employees
police and fire retirement plan and fund is not liable for any claim against the Minneapolis Police
Relief Association, its governing board, or its administrative staff acting in a fiduciary capacity,
under chapter 356A or common law, which is founded upon a claim of a breach of fiduciary duty
if the act or acts constituting the claimed breach were not undertaken in good faith. The public
employees police and fire retirement plan may assert any applicable defense to any claim in any
judicial or administrative proceeding that the Minneapolis Police Relief Association, its board, or
its administrative staff would otherwise have been entitled to assert, and the public employees
police and fire retirement plan may assert any applicable defense that it has in its capacity as a
statewide agency.
    (d) The Public Employees Retirement Association shall indemnify any former fiduciary of
the Minneapolis Police Relief Association consistent with the provisions of section 356A.11.
The indemnification may be effected by the purchase by the Public Employees Retirement
Association of reasonable fiduciary liability tail insurance for the officers and directors of the
former Minneapolis Police Relief Association. Consistent with section 69.80, the relief association
may purchase reasonable fiduciary liability tail insurance for its officers and directors prior to the
effective date of consolidation under Laws 2011, First Special Session chapter 8, article 7, section
19.
    (e) Office equipment and other physical assets of the special fund of the Minneapolis Police
Relief Association that are not needed by the Public Employees Retirement Association may
be sold by the special fund of the Minneapolis Police Relief Association to the general fund
of the Minneapolis Police Relief Association or to any successor fraternal organization of the
Minneapolis Police Relief Association at fair market value, with the proceeds of that sale deposited
in the public employees police and fire retirement fund and included in the transferred asset value
under subdivision 6.

employees police and fire retirement plan on the effective date of consolidation.
    Subd. 3. Transfer of records. On the effective date of consolidation, the chief administrative

    Subd. 4. Transfer of assets; transfer of title to assets. (a) On the effective date of consolidation,
the chief administrative officer of the Fairmont Police Relief Association shall transfer the entire
assets of the special fund of the Fairmont Police Relief Association to the public employees
police and fire retirement fund at market value. Unless ineligible or inappropriate as determined
by the State Board of Investment, the transfer must be in the form of investment securities and
must include any accounts receivable that are determined by the State Board of Investment as
being capable of being collected. The city of Fairmont must transfer, in cash, an amount equal
to the market value, as recognized by the relief association of any investment securities that are
determined by the executive director of the State Board of Investment to be not in compliance
with the requirements and limitations set forth in sections 11A.09, 11A.14, 11A.23, and 11A.24,
or to be inappropriate for retention in light of the established investment objectives of the State
Board of Investment, or of any accounts receivable that are determined by the executive director
as being incapable of being collected. The legal and beneficial title to assets that are determined
to be noncompliant or inappropriate securities or that are determined to be uncollectable accounts
receivable are transferred from the relief association special fund to the city of Fairmont as of the
effective date of consolidation. Any accounts payable of the special fund of the Fairmont Police
Relief Association on the effective date of consolidation, are an obligation of the public employees
police and fire retirement fund and reduce the value of the transferred relief association special
fund assets for purposes of subdivision 6. Assets transferred from the special fund of the Fairmont
Police Relief Association must be deposited in the public employees police and fire retirement
fund and must be managed by the State Board of Investment through the Minnesota combined
investment funds under section 11A.14.
    (b) Upon the transfer of the assets to the management of the State Board of Investment under
paragraph (a), legal title to those transferred assets vests with the State Board of Investment on
behalf of the public employees police and fire retirement plan, and beneficial title to the transferred
assets remains with the former membership of the former Fairmont Police Relief Association.
     (c) The public employees police and fire retirement plan and fund is the successor in interest to all
claims for and against the Fairmont Police Relief Association. The public employees police and fire
retirement plan and fund is not liable for any claim against the Fairmont Police Relief Association or
its governing board acting in a fiduciary capacity under chapter 356A or under common law which
is founded upon a claim of a breach of fiduciary duty if the act or acts constituting the claimed
breach were not undertaken in good faith. The public employees police and fire retirement plan
may assert any applicable defense to any claim in any judicial or administrative proceeding that the
former Fairmont Police Relief Association or its former governing board would otherwise have been
entitled to assert and the public employees police and fire retirement plan may assert any applicable
defense that it has in its capacity as a statewide agency.
    (d) The Public Employees Retirement Association shall indemnify any former fiduciary of
the Fairmont Police Relief Association consistent with the provisions of section 356A.11. The
92ND DAY]                           FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012                                        5005

indemnification may be effected by the purchase by the Public Employees Retirement Association
of reasonable fiduciary liability tail insurance for the officers and directors of the former Fairmont
Police Relief Association.
    Subd. 5. Benefits. (a) The annuities, service pensions, and other retirement benefits of or
attributable to retired members and surviving spouses of the Fairmont Police Relief Association
who had that status as of the effective date of consolidation, continue after consolidation in the
same amount and under the same terms as provided under Minnesota Statutes 2000, sections
423.41 to 423.46, 423.48 to 423.59, 423.61, and 423.62; Laws 1963, chapter 423; Laws 1977,
chapter 100; and Laws 1999, chapter 222, article 3, section 4, except as provided in paragraph (b).
    (b) The annual base salary figure for pension and benefit determinations upon consolidation
and for the balance of calendar year 2012 is $106,666.67. After December 31, 2012, annual
postretirement adjustments of pensions and benefits in force must be calculated solely under
section 356.415, subdivision 1c.
    Subd. 6. Calculation of final funded status; employer contributions. (a) As of the effective
date of consolidation, the approved actuary retained by the Public Employees Retirement
Association under section 356.214 shall determine the final funded status of the Fairmont Police
Relief Association special fund. The final funded status is the present value of future benefits
payable from the Fairmont Police Relief Association as of the effective date of consolidation after
subtracting the market value of the transferred assets of the Fairmont Police Relief Association as
of the effective date of consolidation. The present value of future benefits figure must be calculated
using the applicable actuarial assumptions for the public employees police and fire retirement plan
specified in or established under section 356.215. If there is a remainder present value of future
benefits amount, the city of Fairmont shall pay to the public employees police and fire retirement
fund an amount sufficient, on a level annual dollar basis, to amortize the calculated remainder
present value of future benefits amount by December 31, 2020. Payments shall be made annually
on or before December 31, beginning in 2012.
    (b) If there are assets of the former Fairmont Police Relief Association in excess of the present
value of future benefits as of the effective date of consolidation, these assets must be credited to an

   Sec. 5. [353.6691] MERGER OF THE VIRGINIA FIRE DEPARTMENT RELIEF
5006                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [92ND DAY

ASSOCIATION.
    Subdivision 1. Merger authorized. On the effective date of merger, the Virginia fire department
consolidation account of the Public Employees Retirement Association under chapter 353A
becomes a part of the public employees police and fire retirement plan and fund governed by
sections 353.63 to 353.659.
    Subd. 2. Benefit liability transfer. All current and future liabilities of the Virginia fire
department consolidation account under chapter 353A are liabilities of the public employees police
and fire retirement plan and fund as of the effective date of merger and the accrued benefits of the
members of the consolidation account are the obligation of the public employees police and fire
retirement plan and fund.
    Subd. 3. Transfer of assets; transfer to title assets. On the effective date of merger, the assets
of the Virginia fire department consolidation account must be transferred to the public employees
police and fire retirement fund. Upon transfer, the market value of the assets of the consolidation
account, less any amount of residual assets under subdivision 5, are assets of the public employees
police and fire fund as of the effective date of merger, and the assets, excluding the distribution
amount under subdivision 5, become an asset of the public employees police and fire retirement
fund. The public employees police and fire retirement fund also must be credited as an asset with
the amount of any receivable assets from employer contributions under subdivision 5.
    Subd. 4. Benefits. A person who received a service pension, a disability benefit, or a survivor
benefit from the Virginia fire department consolidation account for the month prior to the effective
date of merger and who has not previously elected postretirement adjustments under section
356.415, subdivision 1c, rather than the postretirement adjustment mechanism of the Virginia
Fire Department Relief Association under section 353A.08, subdivision 1, may elect future
postretirement adjustments under section 356.415, subdivision 1c, or the retention of the former
Virginia Fire Department Relief Association postretirement adjustment mechanism. The election
must be made in writing on a form prescribed by the executive director on or before September
1, 2012. Unless modified by an election under this subdivision, the benefit plan election by any
person or on behalf of any person under section 353A.08 remains binding.
     Subd. 5. Calculation of final funded status; employer contributions. (a) As of the effective
date of merger, the approved actuary retained by the Public Employees Retirement Association
under section 356.214 shall determine the final funded status of the former Virginia Fire Department
Relief Association special fund. The final funded status is the present value of future benefits
payable from the Virginia fire department consolidation account as of the effective date of
merger after subtracting the market value of the transferred assets of the Virginia fire department
consolidation account as of the effective date of merger. The present value of future benefits figure
must be calculated using the applicable actuarial assumptions for the public employees police and
fire retirement plan specified in or established under section 356.215. If there is a remainder present
value of future benefits amount, the city of Virginia shall pay to the public employees police and
fire retirement fund an amount sufficient, on a level annual dollar basis, to amortize the calculated
remainder present value of future benefits amount by December 31, 2020. Payments shall be made
annually on or before December 31, beginning in 2012.
    (b) If there are assets of the former Virginia fire department consolidation account in excess of
the present value of future benefits as of the effective date of merger, these assets shall be credited

to an interest bearing suspense account within the public employees police and fire retirement fund
until January 1, 2013. The suspense account must be credited with the same rate of investment return
as the public employees police and fire retirement fund.
    (c) If, after the effective date of merger, the postretirement or preretirement interest rate actuarial
assumption applicable to the public employees police and fire retirement plan under section 356.215,
subdivision 8, is modified from the rates specified in Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 356.215,
subdivision 8, the remainder present value of future benefits amount calculation under paragraph
(a), updated for the passage of time, must be revised and any amortization contribution by the city
of Virginia for the balance of the amortization period must be redetermined and certified to the city
of Virginia.
    (d) On January 1, 2013, one-half of any suspense account under paragraph (b) must be paid as an
additional ad hoc postretirement adjustment to the service pensioners, disabilitants, and surviving
spouses of the former Virginia fire consolidation account. The additional ad hoc postretirement
adjustment for each recipient is the total amount available for the adjustment divided by the total
number of recipients as of January 1, 2013, of the former Virginia fire consolidation account. On
January 1, 2014, if the suspense account has earned investment income equal to or greater than the
preretirement interest rate assumption applicable to the public employees police and fire retirement
plan under section 356.215, subdivision 8, the balance remaining of the suspense account under
paragraph (b) must be paid as an additional ad hoc postretirement adjustment to the service
pensioners, disabilitants, and surviving spouses of the former Virginia fire consolidation account,
divided by the total number of recipients as of January 1, 2014. Nothing in this paragraph may be
deemed to authorize the payment of a postretirement adjustment to an estate.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective on June 29, 2012, which is the effective date of
merger.

association, if one exists. If a relief association has only one fund, that fund is the special fund
for purposes of this section. If a relief association has a special fund and a general fund, and any
expense of the relief association that is directly related to the purposes for which both funds were
established, the payment of that expense must be apportioned between the two funds on the basis
of the benefits derived by each fund.

    (b)(1) If a firefighter who has ceased to perform or supervise fire suppression and fire prevention
duties for at least 60 days resumes performing active firefighting with the fire department associated
with the relief association, if the bylaws of the relief association so permit, the firefighter may again

membership is subject to the service pension calculation requirements under this section.
    (2) A firefighter who has been granted an approved leave of absence not exceeding one year by
the fire department or by the relief association is exempt from the minimum period of resumption
service requirement of this section.
    (3) A person who has a break in service not exceeding one year but has not been granted an
approved leave of absence and who has not received a service pension or disability benefit may be
made exempt from the minimum period of resumption service requirement of this section by the
relief association bylaws.
   (4) If the bylaws so provide, a firefighter who returns to active relief association membership
under this paragraph may continue to collect a monthly service pension, notwithstanding the service
pension eligibility requirements under chapter 424A.
    (c) If a former firefighter who has received a service pension or disability benefit returns to
active relief association membership under paragraph (b), the firefighter may qualify for the receipt
of a service pension from the relief association for the resumption service period if the firefighter
meets the service requirements of section 424A.016, subdivision 3, or 424A.02, subdivision 2. No
firefighter may be paid a service pension more than once for the same period of service.
     (d) If a former firefighter who has not received a service pension or disability benefit returns to
active relief association membership under paragraph (b), the firefighter may qualify for the receipt

by applying the service pension amount in effect on the date of the firefighter's termination of the
resumption service, or, if the bylaws so provide, based on the service pension amount in effect on
the date of the firefighter's previous cessation of duties. The service pension for a firefighter who
returns to active lump-sum relief association membership under this paragraph, but who had met
the minimum period of resumption service requirement specified in the relief association's bylaws,
must be calculated by applying the service pension amount in effect on the date of the firefighter's
termination of the resumption service.
    (g) If a firefighter receiving a monthly benefit service pension returns to active monthly benefit
relief association membership under paragraph (b), and if the relief association bylaws do not allow
for the firefighter to continue collecting a monthly service pension, any monthly benefit service
pension payable to the firefighter is suspended as of the first day of the month next following the
date on which the firefighter returns to active membership. If the firefighter was receiving a monthly
benefit service pension, and qualifies for a service pension under paragraph (c), the firefighter is
entitled to an additional monthly benefit service pension upon a subsequent cessation of duties
calculated based on the resumption service credit and the service pension accrual amount in effect
on the date of the termination of the resumption service. A suspended initial service pension resumes
as of the first of the month next following the termination of the resumption service. If the firefighter

    (i) For defined contribution plans, a firefighter who returns to active relief association
membership under paragraph (b) and who qualifies for a service pension under paragraph (c) or (d)
must have, upon a subsequent cessation of duties, any service pension for the resumption service
period calculated as a separate benefit. If a service pension had been paid to the firefighter upon
the firefighter's previous cessation of duties, and if the firefighter meets the minimum service
requirement of section 424A.016, subdivision 3, based on the resumption years of service, a second
service pension for the resumption service period must be calculated to include allocations credited
to the firefighter's individual account during the resumption period of service and deductions for
administrative expenses, if applicable.

service and membership is waived for persons who have discontinued their volunteer firefighter
duties and who are employed on a full-time basis under section 424A.015, subdivision 1.
    (b) The deferred service pension is payable when the former member reaches at least age 50,
or at least the minimum age specified in the bylaws governing the relief association if that age is
greater than age 50, and when the former member makes a valid written application.
    (c) A defined contribution relief association may, if its governing bylaws so provide, credit
interest or additional investment performance on the deferred lump-sum service pension during
the period of deferral. If provided for in the bylaws, the interest must be paid:
    (1) at the investment performance rate actually earned on that portion of the assets if the deferred

   (2) at the investment performance rate actually earned on that portion of the assets if the deferred
benefit amount is invested in a separate investment vehicle held by the relief association; or

     ­­) (3) at the investment return on the assets of the special fund of the defined contribution
volunteer firefighter relief association in proportion to the share of the assets of the special fund to
the credit of each individual deferred member account through the accounting date on which the
investment return is recognized by and credited to the special fund.
    (d) Unless the bylaws of a relief association that has elected to pay interest or additional
investment performance on deferred lump-sum service pensions under paragraph (c) specifies a
different interest or additional investment performance method, including the interest or additional
investment performance period starting date and ending date, the interest or additional investment
performance on a deferred service pension is creditable as follows:
    (1) for a relief association that has elected to pay interest or additional investment performance
under paragraph (c), clause (1) or (3), beginning on the date that the member separates from active
service and membership and ending on the accounting date immediately before the deferred member
commences receipt of the deferred service pension; or
   (2) for a relief association that has elected to pay interest or additional investment performance
under paragraph (c), clause (2), beginning on the date that the member separates from active service
and membership and ending on the date that the separate investment vehicle is valued immediately
before the date on which the deferred member commences receipt of the deferred service pension.
    (e) The deferred service pension is governed by and must be calculated under the general
statute, special law, relief association articles of incorporation, and relief association bylaw
provisions applicable on the date on which the member separated from active service with the fire
department and active membership in the relief association.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. (a) This section is effective January 1, 2013.
   (b) This section applies only to persons becoming deferred service pensioners after January 1,
2013.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 424A.02, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Authorization. (a) A defined benefit relief association, when its articles of
incorporation or bylaws so provide, may pay out of the assets of its special fund a defined benefit
service pension to each of its members who: (1) separates from active service with the fire
department; (2) reaches age 50; (3) completes at least five years of active service as an active
member of the municipal fire department to which the relief association is associated; (4) completes
at least five years of active membership with the relief association before separation from active
service; and (5) complies with any additional conditions as to age, service, and membership that are
prescribed by the bylaws of the relief association. A service pension computed under this section
may be prorated monthly for fractional years of service as the bylaws or articles of incorporation of
the relief association so provide. The bylaws or articles of incorporation may define a "month," but
the definition must require a calendar month to have at least 16 days of active service. If the bylaws
or articles of incorporation do not define a "month," a "month" is a completed calendar month

of active service measured from the member's date of entry to the same date in the subsequent
month. The service pension earned by a volunteer firefighter under this chapter and the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the volunteer firefighters' relief association may be paid whether or not
the municipality or nonprofit firefighting corporation to which the relief association is associated
qualifies for the receipt of fire state aid under chapter 69.
    (b) In the case of a member who has completed at least five years of active service as an active
member of the fire department to which the relief association is associated on the date that the relief
association is established and incorporated, the requirement that the member complete at least five
years of active membership with the relief association before separation from active service may be
waived by the board of trustees of the relief association if the member completes at least five years
of inactive membership with the relief association before the date of the payment of the service
pension. During the period of inactive membership, the member is not entitled to receive disability
benefit coverage, is not entitled to receive additional service credit towards computation of a service
pension, and is considered to have the status of a person entitled to a deferred service pension under
subdivision 7.
    (c) No municipality or nonprofit firefighting corporation may delegate the power to take final
action in setting a service pension or ancillary benefit amount or level to the board of trustees of
the relief association or to approve in advance a service pension or ancillary benefit amount or level
equal to the maximum amount or level that this chapter would allow rather than a specific dollar
amount or level.

    (b) The deferred service pension is payable when the former member reaches at least age 50,
or at least the minimum age specified in the bylaws governing the relief association if that age is
greater than age 50, and when the former member makes a valid written application.
    (c) A defined benefit relief association that provides a lump-sum service pension governed by
subdivision 3 may, when its governing bylaws so provide, pay interest on the deferred lump-sum
service pension during the period of deferral. If provided for in the bylaws, interest must be paid in
one of the following manners:
    (1) at the investment performance rate actually earned on that portion of the assets if the deferred
benefit amount is invested by the relief association in a separate account established and maintained
by the relief association o
                          ­­r;
   (2) at the investment performance rate actually earned on that portion of the assets if the deferred
benefit amount is invested in a separate investment vehicle held by the relief association; or
    ­
    (2
     ­­) (3) at an interest rate of up to five percent, compounded annually, as set by the board of
directors and approved as provided in subdivision 10.
    (d) Interest under paragraph (c), clause ­
                                             (2
                                              ­­) (3), is payable following the date on which the
municipality has approved the deferred service pension interest rate established by the board of
trustees.
    (e) Unless the bylaws of a relief association that has elected to pay interest or additional
investment performance on deferred lump-sum service pensions under paragraph (c) specifies a
different interest or additional investment performance method, including the interest or additional
investment performance period starting date and ending date, the interest or additional investment
performance on a deferred service pension is creditable as follows:
    (1) for a relief association that has elected to pay interest or additional investment performance
under paragraph (c), clause (1) or (3), beginning on the date that the member separates from active
service and membership and ending on the accounting date immediately before the deferred member
commences receipt of the deferred service pension; or
   (2) for a relief association that has elected to pay interest or additional investment performance
under paragraph (c), clause (2), beginning on the date that the member separates from active service
and membership and ending on the date that the separate investment vehicle is valued immediately
before the date on which the deferred member commences receipt of the deferred service pension.
    (f) For a deferred service pension that is transferred to a separate account established and
maintained by the relief association or separate investment vehicle held by the relief association, the
deferred member bears the full investment risk subsequent to transfer and in calculating the accrued
liability of the volunteer firefighters relief association that pays a lump-sum service pension, the
accrued liability for deferred service pensions is equal to the separate relief association account
balance or the fair market value of the separate investment vehicle held by the relief association.

   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 424A.02, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Limitation on ancillary benefits. A defined benefit relief association, including any
volunteer firefighters relief association governed by section 69.77 or any volunteer firefighters
division of a relief association governed by chapter 424, may only pay ancillary benefits which
would constitute an authorized disbursement as specified in section 424A.05 subject to the
following requirements or limitations:
    (1) with respect to a defined benefit relief association in which governing bylaws provide solely
for a lump-sum service pension to a retiring member, or provide a retiring member the choice of
either a lump-sum service pension or a monthly service pension and the lump-sum service pension
was chosen, no ancillary benefit may be paid to any former member or paid to any person on behalf
of any former member after the former member (i) terminates active service with the fire department
and active membership in the relief association; and (ii) commences receipt of a service pension as
authorized under this section; and
    (2) with respect to any defined benefit relief association, no ancillary benefit paid or payable to
any member, to any former member, or to any person on behalf of any member or former member,
may exceed in amount the total earned service pension of the member or former member. The total
earned service pension must be calculated by multiplying the service pension amount specified in
the bylaws of the relief association at the time of death or disability, whichever applies, by the years
of service credited to the member or former member. The years of service must be determined as
of (i) the date the member or former member became entitled to the ancillary benefit; or (ii) the
date the member or former member died entitling a survivor or the estate of the member or former
member to an ancillary benefit. The ancillary benefit must be calculated without regard to whether
the member had attained the minimum amount of service and membership credit specified in the
governing bylaws. For active members, the amount of a permanent disability benefit or a survivor
benefit must be equal to the member's total earned service pension except that the bylaws of a defined
benefit relief association may provide for the payment of a survivor benefit in an amount not to
exceed five times the yearly service pension amount specified in the bylaws on behalf of any member
who dies before having performed five years of active service in the fire department with which the
relief association is affiliated.
   (3)(i) If a lump sum survivor or death benefit is payable under the articles of incorporation or
bylaws, the benefit must be paid:
   (A) as a survivor benefit to the surviving spouse of the deceased firefighter;
   (B) as a survivor benefit to the surviving children of the deceased firefighter if no surviving
spouse;

   (C) as a survivor benefit to a designated beneficiary of the deceased firefighter if no surviving
spouse or surviving children; or
    (D) as a death benefit to the estate of the deceased active or deferred firefighter if no surviving
children and no beneficiary designated.
    (ii) If there are no surviving children, the surviving spouse may waive, in writing, wholly or
partially, the spouse's entitlement to a survivor benefit.
    (4)(i) If a monthly benefit survivor or death benefit is payable under the articles of incorporation
or bylaws, the benefit must be paid:
   (A) as a survivor benefit to the surviving spouse of the deceased firefighter;
   (B) as a survivor benefit to the surviving children of the deceased firefighter if no surviving
spouse;
   (C) as a survivor benefit to a designated beneficiary of the deceased firefighter if no surviving
spouse or surviving children; or
   (D) as a death benefit to the estate of the deceased active or deferred firefighter if no surviving
spouse, no surviving children, and no beneficiary designated.
    (ii) If there are no surviving children, the surviving spouse may waive, in writing, wholly or
partially, the spouse's entitlement to a survivor benefit.
   (iii) For purposes of this clause, if the relief association bylaws authorize a monthly survivor
benefit payable to a designated beneficiary, the relief association bylaws may limit the total survivor
benefit amount payable.
    (5) For purposes of this section, for a monthly benefit volunteer fire relief association or for a
combination lump-sum and monthly benefit volunteer fire relief association where a monthly benefit
service pension has been elected by or a monthly benefit is payable with respect to a firefighter,
a designated beneficiary must be a natural person. For purposes of this section, for a lump-sum
volunteer fire relief association or for a combination lump-sum and monthly benefit volunteer fire
relief association where a lump-sum service pension has been elected by or a lump-sum benefit
is payable with respect to a firefighter, a trust created under chapter 501B may be a designated
beneficiary. If a trust is payable to the surviving children organized under chapter 501B as authorized
by this section and there is no surviving spouse, the survivor benefit may be paid to the trust,
notwithstanding a requirement of this section to the contrary.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2013.

section 356.551, as of the date of the asset transfer, the untransferred balance of the prior service
and salary may be purchased on June 30, 2014, by the applicable person or a combination of the

   (1) was born on February 2, 1978;
    (2) was initially employed by the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system on a
part-time basis at Metropolitan State University on August 27, 2005;
    (3) was also additionally employed within the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system
at Inver Hills Community College and St. Paul College; and
    (4) was covered by the higher education individual retirement account plan because of a failure
of Metropolitan State University to advise the eligible person about the optional election and default
retirement coverage provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 354B.21, subdivisions 2 and 3.
    (c) An eligible person may elect retirement coverage by the Teachers Retirement Association
rather than the higher education individual retirement account plan for faculty employment
rendered after the date of the retirement coverage election under this section and for past Minnesota
State Colleges and Universities system faculty employment from August 27, 2005, until the date
of the retirement coverage election. The election must be made in writing, must be filed with the
executive director of the Teachers Retirement Association, and must be accompanied with any
relevant documentation required by the executive director of the Teachers Retirement Association.
    (d) If an eligible person makes the retirement coverage election under paragraph (c), the eligible
person's member contributions to the higher education individual retirement account plan must be
transferred to the Teachers Retirement Association, with any earned investment returns on those
contributions. If the transferred member contributions and investment earnings are less than the
calculated amount of the member contribution that the eligible person would have made to the
Teachers Retirement Association on the eligible person's compensation from the Minnesota State
Colleges and Universities system for the period from August 27, 2005, to the date of the retirement
coverage election, if the person had been covered by the Teachers Retirement Association during
the period, plus annual compound interest at the rate of 8.5 percent, the eligible person shall pay the
balance of that calculated member contribution obligation within 30 days of the retirement coverage
election. Any payment may be made through an institution-to-institution transfer from the eligible
person's account in the Minnesota state deferred compensation program or the eligible person's
tax-sheltered savings account under section 403(b) of the federal Internal Revenue Code.
    (e) Upon the transfer of the equivalent member contribution amount and any additional payments
under paragraph (d), the balance of the eligible person's higher education individual retirement
account plan account must be transferred to the Teachers Retirement Association. If the amounts
under paragraph (d) and the higher education individual retirement account plan account balance
under this paragraph are less than the prior service credit purchase payment amount calculated under
Minnesota Statutes, section 356.551, the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system shall pay
that difference within 60 days of the retirement coverage election date.
    (f) Upon the transfers and payments under paragraphs (d) and (e), the eligible person must be
credited by the Teachers Retirement Association with allowable and formula service for Minnesota
State Colleges and Universities system employment since August 27, 2005.
    (g) The authority to make a retirement coverage election under this section expires on January
1, 2013.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

   Subd. 2. Calculation of health care costs and quality. The commissioner of health shall
develop a uniform method of calculating providers' relative cost of care, defined as a measure
of health care spending including resource use and unit prices, and relative quality of care. In

across provider patient populations, using generally accepted and transparent risk adjustment
methodologies and case mix adjustment;

results related to the peer grouping system that identify hospitals, clinics, or other providers only if
the following criteria are met:
   (1) the results, data, and summaries, including any graphical depictions of provider performance,
have been distributed to providers at least 120 days prior to publication;
   (2) the commissioner has provided an opportunity for providers to verify and review data for
which the provider is the subject consistent with the recommendations developed pursuant to
paragraph (d) and adopted by the commissioner;
   (3) the results meet thresholds of validity, reliability, statistical significance, representativeness,
and other standards that reflect the recommendations of the advisory committee, established under
subdivision 3; and
    (4) any public report or other usage of the analyses, report, or data used by the state clearly
notifies consumers about how to use and interpret the results, including any limitations of the data
and analysis.

     ­­) (c) After publishing the first public report, the commissioner shall, no less frequently than
annually, publish information on providers' total cost, total resource use, total quality, and the
results of the total care portion of the peer grouping process, as well as information on providers'
condition-specific cost, condition-specific resource use, and condition-specific quality, and the
results of the condition-specific portion of the peer grouping process. The results that are published
must be on a risk-adjusted basis, including case mix adjustments.
    (d) The commissioner shall convene a work group comprised of representatives of physician
clinics, hospitals, their respective statewide associations, and other relevant stakeholder
organizations to make recommendations on data to be made available to hospitals and physician
clinics to allow for verification of the accuracy and representativeness of the provider peer grouping
results.

advisory committee and representatives of physician clinics and hospitals during the peer grouping
data analysis process to obtain input on the methodological options prior to final analysis and on the
design, development, and testing of provider reports.

not included in a health care claim or equivalent encounter information transaction that is required
under section 62J.536.

                                    ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
    Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 84.027, subdivision 15, is amended to read:
    Subd. 15. Electronic transactions. (a) The commissioner may receive an application for, sell,
and issue any license, stamp, permit, pass, sticker, gift card, safety training certification, registration,
or transfer under the jurisdiction of the commissioner by electronic means, including by telephone.
Notwithstanding section 97A.472, electronic and telephone transactions may be made outside of
the state. The commissioner may:
    (1) provide for the electronic transfer of funds generated by electronic transactions, including
by telephone;
    (2) assign an identification number to an applicant who purchases a hunting or fishing license or
recreational vehicle registration by electronic means, to serve as temporary authorization to engage
in the activity requiring a license or registration until the license or registration is received or expires;
    (3) charge and permit agents to charge a fee of individuals who make electronic transactions and
transactions by telephone or Internet, including issuing fees and an additional transaction fee not to
exceed $3.50;
    (4) charge and permit agents to charge a convenience fee not to exceed three percent of the cost of
the license to individuals who use electronic bank cards for payment. An electronic licensing system
agent charging a fee of individuals making an electronic bank card transaction in person must post
a sign informing individuals of the fee. The sign must be near the point of payment, clearly visible,
include the amount of the fee, and state: "License agents are allowed by state law to charge a fee
not to exceed three percent of the cost of state licenses to persons who use electronic bank cards for
payment. The fee is not required by state law.";
    (5) establish, by written order, an electronic licensing system commission to be paid by revenues
generated from all sales made through the electronic licensing system. The commissioner shall
establish the commission in a manner that neither significantly overrecovers nor underrecovers costs
involved in providing the electronic licensing system; and
    (6) adopt rules to administer the provisions of this subdivision.
    (b) The fees established under paragraph (a), clauses (3) and (4), and the commission established
under paragraph (a), clause (5), are not subject to the rulemaking procedures of chapter 14 and
section 14.386 does not apply.
92ND DAY]                                       FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012                                                             5071

    (c) Money received from fees and commissions collected under this subdivision, including
interest earned, is annually appropriated from the game and fish fund and the natural resources
fund to the commissioner for the cost of electronic licensing.
    (d) Game and fish licenses under chapters 97A, 97B, and 97C shall be available by electronic
transaction, regardless of whether all or any part of the biennial appropriation law for the
department has been enacted. If, by July 1 of an odd-numbered year, legislation has not been
enacted to appropriate money to the commissioner of management and budget for central
accounting, procurement, payroll, and human resources functions, amounts necessary to operate
those functions for the purpose of this paragraph are appropriated from the general fund to the
commissioner of management and budget. As necessary, the commissioner may transfer a portion
of this appropriation to other state agencies to support carrying out these functions. Any subsequent
appropriation to the commissioner of management and budget for a biennium in which this section
is applicable supersedes and replaces the funding authorized in this paragraph. This paragraph may
be cited as the "Freedom to Hunt and Fish Act of 2012."
     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 84.67, is amended to read:
     84.67 FORESTS FOR THE FUTURE REVOLVING ACCOUNT.
     A forests for the future revolving account is created in the natural resources fund. Money in the
account is appropriated to the commissioner of natural resources for the acquisition of forest lands
that meet the eligibility criteria in section 84.66, subdivision 4. The commissioner shall sell the lands
acquired under this section, subject to an easement as provided in section 84.66. Money received
from the sale of forest lands acquired under this section and interest earned on the account shall
be deposited into the account. T           ­h­­e­co­m­m ­­s

removed from waters of the state. Any check stations shall be operated in a manner that minimizes
delays to vehicles, equipment, and their occupants.
    (e) Conservation officers or other licensed peace officers may order water-related equipment to
be removed from a water body if the commissioner determines such action is needed to implement
aquatic invasive species control measures.
   (f) The commissioner may require mandatory inspections of water-related equipment before a
person places or removes water-related equipment into or out of a water body. Inspection stations
may be located at or near public water accesses or in locations that allow for servicing multiple

by the commissioner;
   (4) have decontamination equipment available at inspection stations or identify alternative
decontamination equipment locations within a reasonable distance of the inspection station that
can bring water-related equipment into compliance;
      (5) provide for inspection station locations that do not create traffic delays or public safety issues;
and
      (6) submit a plan approved by the commissioner according to paragraph (h).
      (h) Plans required under paragraph (g) must address:

   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 85.055, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Fee deposit and appropriation; continued operation. (a) The fees collected under
this section shall be deposited in the natural resources fund and credited to the state parks account.
Money in the account, except for the electronic licensing system commission established by
the commissioner under section 84.027, subdivision 15, is available for appropriation to the
commissioner to operate and maintain the state park system.
    (b) State parks and recreation areas shall remain open for camping and other recreational
activities, regardless of whether all or any part of the biennial appropriation law for the state parks
and recreation areas has been enacted. The amount necessary for operations of state parks and
recreation areas when the biennial appropriation law has not been enacted is appropriated from the
state parks account in the natural resources fund. If, by July 1 of an odd-numbered year, legislation
has not been enacted to appropriate money to the commissioner of management and budget for
central accounting, procurement, payroll, and human resources functions, amounts necessary to
operate those functions for the purpose of this paragraph are appropriated from the general fund
to the commissioner of management and budget. As necessary, the commissioner may transfer a
portion of this appropriation to other state agencies to support carrying out these functions. Any
subsequent appropriation to the commissioner of management and budget for a biennium in which
this paragraph has been applied supersedes and replaces the funding authorized in this paragraph.

the commissioner of management and budget for central accounting, procurement, payroll, and
human resources functions, amounts necessary to operate those functions for the purpose of this
paragraph are appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of management and budget.

    Subd. 14. Local water management coordination. (a) The board may adopt resolutions,
policies, or orders that allow a comprehensive plan, local water management plan, or watershed
management plan, developed or amended, approved and adopted, according to chapter 103B,
103C, or 103D to serve as substitutes for one another or be replaced with a comprehensive
watershed management plan. The board may also develop criteria for incorporating or coordinating
the elements of metropolitan county groundwater plans in accordance with section 103B.255.
The board shall, to the extent practicable, incorporate a watershed approach when adopting the
resolutions, policies, or orders, and shall establish a suggested watershed boundary framework for
development, approval, adoption, and coordination of plans.

    (b) The board shall work with local government stakeholders and others to foster mutual
understanding and develop recommendations for local water management and related state water
management policy and programs. The board may convene informal working groups or work teams
to develop information, education, and recommendations. Local government units may develop
and carry out TMDL implementation plans, or their equivalent, as provided in chapter 114D, as part
of the local water management plans and responsibilities under chapters 103B, 103C, and 103D.
    Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103B.101, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 15. Local water management boundary and plan determinations and appeals. (a)
Local government units may either submit a request for a plan boundary determination as part
of a plan approval request or apply separately for a plan boundary determination from the board
before requesting plan approval. Local government units must provide written documentation of the
rationale and justification for the proposed boundary. The board may request additional information
needed to make a plan boundary determination.
    (b) Local government units may appeal a board decision to deny approval of a plan or the
establishment of a plan boundary. An appeal of a board decision may be taken to the state Court of
Appeals and must be considered an appeal from a contested case decision for purposes of judicial
review under sections 14.63 to 14.69. Local government units may request the board's dispute
resolution committee or executive director to hear and make recommendations to resolve boundary
and plan implementation disputes.
    Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103B.311, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Water plan requirements. (a) A local water management plan must:
    (1) cover the entire area within a county;
    (2) address water problems in the context of watershed units and groundwater systems;
   (3) be based upon principles of sound hydrologic management of water, effective environmental
protection, and efficient management;
    (4) be consistent with local water management plans prepared by counties and watershed
management organizations wholly or partially within a single watershed unit or groundwater
system; and
     (5) the local water management plan must specify the period covered by the local water
management plan and must extend at least five years but no more than ten years from the date
the board approves the local water management plan. Local water management plans that contain
revision dates inconsistent with this section must comply with that date, provided it is not more
than ten years beyond the date of board approval. A           ­ ­w

   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103B.355, is amended to read:
   103B.355 APPLICATION.
    Sections 103B.301 to 103B.335 and 103B.341 to 103B.355 do not apply in areas subject to the
requirements of sections 103B.201 to 103B.255 under section 103B.231, subdivision 1, and in areas
covered by an agreement under section 103B.231, subdivision 2, except as otherwise provided in
section 103B.311, subdivision 4, clause (4).
   Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 103G.222, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Requirements. (a) Wetlands must not be drained or filled, wholly or partially,
unless replaced by restoring or creating wetland areas of at least equal public value under
a replacement plan approved as provided in section 103G.2242, a replacement plan under a
local governmental unit's comprehensive wetland protection and management plan approved by
the board under section 103G.2243, or, if a permit to mine is required under section 93.481,
under a mining reclamation plan approved by the commissioner under the permit to mine. For

project-specific wetland replacement completed prior to wetland impacts authorized or conducted
under a permit to mine within the Great Lakes and Rainy River watershed basins, those basins
shall be considered a single watershed for purposes of determining wetland replacement ratios.
Mining reclamation plans shall apply the same principles and standards for replacing wetlands by
restoration or creation of wetland areas that are applicable to mitigation plans approved as provided
in section 103G.2242. Public value must be determined in accordance with section 103B.3355 or
a comprehensive wetland protection and management plan established under section 103G.2243.
Sections 103G.221 to 103G.2372 also apply to excavation in permanently and semipermanently
flooded areas of types 3, 4, and 5 wetlands.
    (b) Replacement must be guided by the following principles in descending order of priority:
    (1) avoiding the direct or indirect impact of the activity that may destroy or diminish the wetland;
   (2) minimizing the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the wetland activity and its
implementation;
   (3) rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected wetland
environment;
   (4) reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations
during the life of the activity;
    (5) compensating for the impact by restoring a wetland; and
   (6) compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute wetland resources or
environments.
    For a project involving the draining or filling of wetlands in an amount not exceeding 10,000
square feet more than the applicable amount in section 103G.2241, subdivision 9, paragraph (a), the
local government unit may make an on-site sequencing determination without a written alternatives
analysis from the applicant.
     (c) If a wetland is located in a cultivated field, then replacement must be accomplished through
restoration only without regard to the priority order in paragraph (b), provided that ­   ad

wetland area drained is at risk of conversion to a nonagricultural use within ten years based on the
zoning classification, proximity to a municipality or full service road, or other criteria as determined
by the local government unit.
   (e) Restoration and replacement of wetlands must be accomplished in accordance with the
ecology of the landscape area affected and ponds that are created primarily to fulfill storm water
management, and water quality treatment requirements may not be used to satisfy replacement
requirements under this chapter unless the design includes pretreatment of runoff and the pond is
functioning as a wetland.

    (f) Except as provided in paragraph (g), for a wetland or public waters wetland located on
nonagricultural land, replacement must be in the ratio of two acres of replaced wetland for each
acre of drained or filled wetland.
    (g) For a wetland or public waters wetland located on agricultural land or in a greater than 80
percent area, replacement must be in the ratio of one acre of replaced wetland for each acre of
drained or filled wetland.
    (h) Wetlands that are restored or created as a result of an approved replacement plan are subject
to the provisions of this section for any subsequent drainage or filling.
    (i) Except in a greater than 80 percent area, only wetlands that have been restored from
previously drained or filled wetlands, wetlands created by excavation in nonwetlands, wetlands
created by dikes or dams along public or private drainage ditches, or wetlands created by dikes
or dams associated with the restoration of previously drained or filled wetlands may be used in a
statewide banking program established in rules adopted under section 103G.2242, subdivision 1.
Modification or conversion of nondegraded naturally occurring wetlands from one type to another
are not eligible for enrollment in a statewide wetlands bank.
    (j) The Technical Evaluation Panel established under section 103G.2242, subdivision 2,
shall ensure that sufficient time has occurred for the wetland to develop wetland characteristics
of soils, vegetation, and hydrology before recommending that the wetland be deposited in the
statewide wetland bank. If the Technical Evaluation Panel has reason to believe that the wetland
characteristics may change substantially, the panel shall postpone its recommendation until the
wetland has stabilized.
    (k) This section and sections 103G.223 to 103G.2242, 103G.2364, and 103G.2365 apply to the
state and its departments and agencies.
    (l) For projects involving draining or filling of wetlands associated with a new public
transportation project, and for projects expanded solely for additional traffic capacity, public
transportation authorities may purchase credits from the board at the cost to the board to establish
credits. Proceeds from the sale of credits provided under this paragraph are appropriated to the
board for the purposes of this paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, "transportation
project" does not include an airport project.
     (m) A replacement plan for wetlands is not required for individual projects that result in the
filling or draining of wetlands for the repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or replacement of a
currently serviceable existing state, city, county, or town public road necessary, as determined by the
public transportation authority, to meet state or federal design or safety standards or requirements,
excluding new roads or roads expanded solely for additional traffic capacity lanes. This paragraph
only applies to authorities for public transportation projects that:
   (1) minimize the amount of wetland filling or draining associated with the project and consider
mitigating important site-specific wetland functions on site;
    (2) except as provided in clause (3), submit project-specific reports to the board, the Technical
Evaluation Panel, the commissioner of natural resources, and members of the public requesting a
copy at least 30 days prior to construction that indicate the location, amount, and type of wetlands to
be filled or drained by the project or, alternatively, convene an annual meeting of the parties required
5088                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [92ND DAY

to receive notice to review projects to be commenced during the upcoming year; and
    (3) for minor and emergency maintenance work impacting less than 10,000 square feet, submit
project-specific reports, within 30 days of commencing the activity, to the board that indicate the
location, amount, and type of wetlands that have been filled or drained.
    Those required to receive notice of public transportation projects may appeal minimization,
delineation, and on-site mitigation decisions made by the public transportation authority to the board
according to the provisions of section 103G.2242, subdivision 9. The Technical Evaluation Panel
shall review minimization and delineation decisions made by the public transportation authority and
provide recommendations regarding on-site mitigation if requested to do so by the local government
unit, a contiguous landowner, or a member of the Technical Evaluation Panel.
     Except for state public transportation projects, for which the state Department of Transportation
is responsible, the board must replace the wetlands, and wetland areas of public waters if authorized
by the commissioner or a delegated authority, drained or filled by public transportation projects on
existing roads.
    Public transportation authorities at their discretion may deviate from federal and state design
standards on existing road projects when practical and reasonable to avoid wetland filling or
draining, provided that public safety is not unreasonably compromised. The local road authority
and its officers and employees are exempt from liability for any tort claim for injury to persons or
property arising from travel on the highway and related to the deviation from the design standards
for construction or reconstruction under this paragraph. This paragraph does not preclude an action
for damages arising from negligence in construction or maintenance on a highway.
    (n) If a landowner seeks approval of a replacement plan after the proposed project has already
affected the wetland, the local government unit may require the landowner to replace the affected
wetland at a ratio not to exceed twice the replacement ratio otherwise required.
   (o) A local government unit may request the board to reclassify a county or watershed on
the basis of its percentage of presettlement wetlands remaining. After receipt of satisfactory
documentation from the local government, the board shall change the classification of a county
or watershed. If requested by the local government unit, the board must assist in developing the
documentation. Within 30 days of its action to approve a change of wetland classifications, the
board shall publish a notice of the change in the Environmental Quality Board Monitor.
   (p) One hundred citizens who reside within the jurisdiction of the local government unit may
request the local government unit to reclassify a county or watershed on the basis of its percentage of
presettlement wetlands remaining. In support of their petition, the citizens shall provide satisfactory
documentation to the local government unit. The local government unit shall consider the petition
and forward the request to the board under paragraph (o) or provide a reason why the petition is
denied.
   Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103G.2241, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Agricultural activities. A replacement plan for wetlands is not required for:
   (1) activities in a wetland that was planted with annually seeded crops, was in a crop rotation
seeding of pasture grass or legumes, or was required to be set aside to receive price support or other
payments under United States Code, title 7, sections 1421 to 1469, in six of the last ten years prior

to January 1, 1991;
    (2) activities in a type 1 wetland on agricultural pasture land that remains in the same use, except
for bottomland hardwood type 1 wetlands, and activities in a type 2 or type 6 wetland that is less
than two acres in size and located on agricultural pasture land that remains in the same use;
    (3) activities in a wetland conducted as part of normal farming practices. For purposes of this
clause, "normal farming practices" means farming, silvicultural, grazing, and ranching activities
such as plowing, seeding, cultivating, and harvesting for the production of feed, food, and fiber
products, but does not include activities that result in the draining of wetlands;
    (4) soil and water conservation practices approved by the soil and water conservation district,
after review by the Technical Evaluation Panel;
    (5) aquaculture activities including pond excavation and construction and maintenance of
associated access roads and dikes authorized under, and conducted in accordance with, a permit
issued by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the federal Clean Water
Act, United States Code, title 33, section 1344, but not including construction or expansion of
buildings;
   (6) wild rice production activities, including necessary diking and other activities authorized
under a permit issued by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the federal
Clean Water Act, United States Code, title 33, section 1344; or
     (7) agricultural activities on agricultural land that is subject to federal farm program restrictions

It is the purpose of sections 115.41 to 115.53 to safeguard the waters of the state from pollution by:
(a) preventing any new pollution; and (b) abating pollution existing when sections 115.41 to 115.53
become effective, under a program consistent with the declaration of policy above stated.
    Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 115.55, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Local standards. (a) Existing systems. Counties may adopt by ordinance local
standards that are less restrictive than the agency's rules in order to define an acceptable existing
system. The local standards may include soil separation, soil classification, vegetation, system use,
localized well placement and construction, localized density of systems and wells, extent of area to
be covered by local standards, groundwater flow patterns, and existing natural or artificial drainage
systems. The local standards and criteria shall be submitted to the commissioner for comment prior
to adoption to demonstrate that, based on local circumstances in that jurisdiction, they adequately
protect public health and the environment.
     (b) New or replacement systems. Counties, after providing documentation of conditions
listed in this paragraph to the commissioner, may adopt by ordinance local standards that are
less restrictive than the agency's rules for new system construction or replacement in areas of
sustained and projected low population density where conditions render conformance to applicable
requirements difficult or otherwise inappropriate. Documentation may include a map delineating
the area of the county to be served by the local standards, a description of the hardship that
would result from strict adherence to the agency's rules, and evidence of sustained and projected
low population density. The local standards must protect human health and the environment and
be based on considerations that may include, but need not be limited to, soil separation, soil
classification, vegetation, system use, localized well placement and construction, localized density
of systems and wells, extent of area to be covered by local standards, groundwater flow patterns,
and existing natural or artificial drainage systems. The local standards must provide cost-effective
and long-term treatment alternatives. The draft ordinance incorporating the local standards must be
submitted with justification to the commissioner 30 days before adoption for review and comment.
    (c) New or replacement systems; local ordinances. A local unit of government may adopt and
enforce ordinances or rules affecting new or replacement subsurface sewage treatment systems that
are more restrictive than the agency's rules. A local unit of government may not adopt or enforce an
ordinance or rule if its effect is to prevent or delay recording with the county recorder or registrar
of titles of a deed or other instrument that is otherwise entitled to be recorded.
    (d) Local standards; conflict with state law. Local standards adopted under paragraph (a) or
(b) must not conflict with any requirements under other state laws or rules or local ordinances,
5094                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [92ND DAY

including, but not limited to, requirements for:
   (1) systems in shoreland areas, regulated under sections 103F.201 to 103F.221;
   (2) well construction and location, regulated under chapter 103I; and
   (3) systems used in connection with food, beverage, and lodging establishments, regulated under
chapter 157.
Alternative local standards for new or replacement residential systems with flow of 2,500 gallons
per day or less may be applied to systems listed in clause (1), provided the alternative standards are
no less stringent than provisions of Minnesota Rules, chapter 7080, that went into effect on April
3, 2006. In addition, alternative local standards for new or replacement systems with flow of 2,500
gallons per day or less may be applied to systems listed in clause (3), provided the alternative
standards are no less stringent than provisions of Minnesota Rules, chapter 7080, that went into
effect on April 3, 2006, except that the waste strength must meet the standards established in
Minnesota Rules, part 7080.2150, subpart 3, item K. If additional treatment of waste is needed to
meet this standard, the treatment must be in accordance with Minnesota Rules, part 7080.2150,
subpart 3, item A. The local standards must include references to applicable requirements under
other state laws or rules or local ordinances. Nothing in this paragraph prevents a local subsurface
sewage treatment system ordinance from including provisions of the current rule as part of the
alternative local standards.
   Sec. 45. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 115A.1320, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
   Subdivision 1. Duties of the agency. (a) The agency shall administer sections 115A.1310 to
115A.1330.
   (b) The agency shall establish procedures for:
   (1) receipt and maintenance of the registration statements and certifications filed with the agency
under section 115A.1312; and
  (2) making the statements and certifications easily available to manufacturers, retailers, and
members of the public.
    (c) The agency shall annually review the value of the following variables that are part of
the formula used to calculate a manufacturer's annual registration fee under section 115A.1314,
subdivision 1:
   (1) the proportion of sales of video display devices sold to households that manufacturers are
required to recycle;
   (2) the estimated per-pound price of recycling covered electronic devices sold to households;
   (3) the base registration fee; and
   (4) the multiplier established for the weight of covered electronic devices collected in section
115A.1314, subdivision 1, paragraph (d). If the agency determines that any of these values must be
changed in order to improve the efficiency or effectiveness of the activities regulated under sections
115A.1312 to 115A.1330, the agency shall submit recommended changes and the reasons for them

to the chairs of the senate and house of representatives committees with jurisdiction over solid waste
policy.
   (d) By January 15 each year, beginning in 2008, the agency shall calculate estimated sales of
video display devices sold to households by each manufacturer during the preceding program year,
based on national sales data, and forward the estimates to the department.

to the governor and the legislature on the implementation of sections 115A.1310 to 115A.1330. For
each program year, the report must discuss the total weight of covered electronic devices recycled
and a summary of information in the reports submitted by manufacturers and recyclers under section
115A.1316. The report must also discuss the various collection programs used by manufacturers to
collect covered electronic devices; information regarding covered electronic devices that are being
collected by persons other than registered manufacturers, collectors, and recyclers; and information
about covered electronic devices, if any, being disposed of in landfills in this state. The report must
include a description of enforcement actions under sections 115A.1310 to 115A.1330. The agency
may include in its report other information received by the agency regarding the implementation of
sections 115A.1312 to 115A.1330. The report must be done in conjunction with the report required
under section 115D.10.
   (f) The agency shall promote public participation in the activities regulated under sections
115A.1312 to 115A.1330 through public education and outreach efforts.
    (g) The agency shall enforce sections 115A.1310 to 115A.1330 in the manner provided by
sections 115.071, subdivisions 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6; and 116.072, except for those provisions enforced
by the department, as provided in subdivision 2. The agency may revoke a registration of a collector
or recycler found to have violated sections 115A.1310 to 115A.1330.
   (h) The agency shall facilitate communication between counties, collection and recycling
centers, and manufacturers to ensure that manufacturers are aware of video display devices
available for recycling.
   (i) The agency shall develop a form retailers must use to report information to manufacturers
under section 115A.1318 and post it on the agency's Web site.

    (1) a summary of the current status of solid waste management, including the amount of solid
waste generated and reduced, the manner in which it is collected, processed, and disposed, the extent
of separation, recycling, reuse, and recovery of solid waste, and the facilities available or under
development to manage the waste;
    (2) an evaluation of the extent and effectiveness of implementation ­   an
                                                                             ­d­ of section 115A.02,
including an assessment of progress in accomplishing state policies, goals, and objectives, including
those listed in paragraph (b);
    (3) identification of issues requiring further research, study, and action, the appropriate scope
of the research, study, or action, the state agency or political subdivision that should implement the
research, study, or action, and a schedule for completion of the activity; and
   (4) recommendations for establishing or modifying state solid waste management policies,
authorities, responsibilities, and programs.
    (b) Beginning in 1997, and every sixth year thereafter, the report shall be expanded to include
the metropolitan area solid waste policy plan required in section 473.149, subdivision 1, and
strategies for the agency to advance the goals of this chapter, to manage waste as a resource,
to further reduce the need for expenditures on resource recovery and disposal facilities, and to
further reduce long-term environmental and financial liabilities. The expanded report must include
strategies for:
     (1) achieving the maximum feasible reduction in waste generation;
    (2) encouraging manufacturers to design products that eliminate or reduce the adverse
environmental impacts of resource extraction, manufacturing, use, and waste processing and
disposal;

    (3) educating businesses, public entities, and other consumers about the need to consider the
potential environmental and financial impacts of purchasing products that may create a liability or
that may be expensive to recycle or manage as waste, due to the presence of toxic or hazardous
components;
   (4) eliminating or reducing toxic or hazardous components in compost from municipal solid
waste composting facilities, in ash from municipal solid waste incinerators, and in leachate and air
emissions from municipal solid waste landfills, in order to reduce the potential liability of waste
generators, facility owners and operators, and taxpayers;
    (5) encouraging the source separation of materials to the extent practicable, so that the materials
are most appropriately managed and to ensure that resources that can be reused or recycled are not
disposed of or destroyed; and
    (6) maximizing the efficiency of the waste management system by managing waste and
recyclables close to the point of generation, taking into account the characteristics of the resources
to be recovered from the waste and the type and capacity of local facilities.

as a goal to recycle the following amounts:
   (1) for a county outside of the metropolitan area, 35 percent by weight of total solid waste
generation;
     (2) for a metropolitan county, 50 percent by weight of total solid waste generation.
    Each county will develop and implement or require political subdivisions within the county to
develop and implement programs, practices, or methods designed to meet its recycling goal. Nothing
in this section or in any other law may be construed to prohibit a county from establishing a higher
recycling goal.

meet requirements of subdivision 1, the commissioner of public safety shall be given access to the
facility plan.
    (c) After reviewing the plan and the progress report with any modifications submitted,
the commissioner of public safety shall state in writing whether the progress report meets the
requirements of subdivision 1. If the commissioner of public safety determines that a modified
progress report still does not meet the requirements of subdivision 1, the commissioner of public
safety shall schedule a public meeting. The meeting shall be held in the county where the facility is
located. The meeting is not subject to the requirements of chapter 14.
    (d) The facility shall be given the opportunity to amend the progress report within a period of
not less than 30 days after the public meeting.
    (e) If the commissioner of public safety determines that a modified progress report still does
not meet the requirements of subdivision 1, action may be taken under section 115.071 to obtain
compliance with sections 115D.01 to 115D.12.

every four years thereafter, to the governor and the legislature concerning the activities of the
Interstate Commission. The report shall include any recommendations the commissioner deems
necessary to assure the protection of the interest of the state in the proper functioning of the

change in the status of a host state or other party states in the compact.
   Sec. 57. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 116D.04, subdivision 2a, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2a. When prepared. Where there is potential for significant environmental effects
resulting from any major governmental action, the action shall be preceded by a detailed
environmental impact statement prepared by the responsible governmental unit. The environmental
impact statement shall be an analytical rather than an encyclopedic document which describes the
proposed action in detail, analyzes its significant environmental impacts, discusses appropriate
92ND DAY]                         FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012                                     5101

alternatives to the proposed action and their impacts, and explores methods by which adverse
environmental impacts of an action could be mitigated. The environmental impact statement shall
also analyze those economic, employment and sociological effects that cannot be avoided should
the action be implemented. To ensure its use in the decision-making process, the environmental
impact statement shall be prepared as early as practical in the formulation of an action. No
mandatory environmental impact statement may be required for an ethanol plant, as defined in
section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), that produces less than 125,000,000 gallons of
ethanol annually and is located outside of the seven-county metropolitan area.
    (a) The board shall by rule establish categories of actions for which environmental impact
statements and for which environmental assessment worksheets shall be prepared as well as
categories of actions for which no environmental review is required under this section. A mandatory
environmental assessment worksheet shall not be required for the expansion of an ethanol plant,
as defined in section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), or the conversion of an ethanol plant
to a biobutanol facility or the expansion of a biobutanol facility as defined in section 41A.105,
subdivision 1a, based on the capacity of the expanded or converted facility to produce alcohol
fuel, but must be required if the ethanol plant or biobutanol facility meets or exceeds thresholds
of other categories of actions for which environmental assessment worksheets must be prepared.
The responsible governmental unit for an ethanol plant or biobutanol facility project for which
an environmental assessment worksheet is prepared shall be the state agency with the greatest
responsibility for supervising or approving the project as a whole.
    (b) The responsible governmental unit shall promptly publish notice of the completion of
an environmental assessment worksheet in a manner to be determined by the board and shall
provide copies of the environmental assessment worksheet to the board and its member agencies.
Comments on the need for an environmental impact statement may be submitted to the responsible
governmental unit during a 30-day period following publication of the notice that an environmental
assessment worksheet has been completed. The responsible governmental unit's decision on the
need for an environmental impact statement shall be based on the environmental assessment
worksheet and the comments received during the comment period, and shall be made within 15
days after the close of the comment period. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not
more than 15 additional days upon the request of the responsible governmental unit.
    (c) An environmental assessment worksheet shall also be prepared for a proposed action
whenever material evidence accompanying a petition by not less than 100 individuals who reside
or own property in the state, submitted before the proposed project has received final approval
by the appropriate governmental units, demonstrates that, because of the nature or location of a
proposed action, there may be potential for significant environmental effects. Petitions requesting
the preparation of an environmental assessment worksheet shall be submitted to the board. The
chair of the board shall determine the appropriate responsible governmental unit and forward the
petition to it. A decision on the need for an environmental assessment worksheet shall be made by
the responsible governmental unit within 15 days after the petition is received by the responsible
governmental unit. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not more than 15 additional
days upon request of the responsible governmental unit.
   (d) Except in an environmentally sensitive location where Minnesota Rules, part 4410.4300,
subpart 29, item B, applies, the proposed action is exempt from environmental review under this
chapter and rules of the board, if:
5102                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [92ND DAY

   (1) the proposed action is:
   (i) an animal feedlot facility with a capacity of less than 1,000 animal units; or
   (ii) an expansion of an existing animal feedlot facility with a total cumulative capacity of less
than 1,000 animal units;
    (2) the application for the animal feedlot facility includes a written commitment by the proposer
to design, construct, and operate the facility in full compliance with Pollution Control Agency
feedlot rules; and
    (3) the county board holds a public meeting for citizen input at least ten business days prior
to the Pollution Control Agency or county issuing a feedlot permit for the animal feedlot facility
unless another public meeting for citizen input has been held with regard to the feedlot facility to be
permitted. The exemption in this paragraph is in addition to other exemptions provided under other
law and rules of the board.
    (e) The board may, prior to final approval of a proposed project, require preparation of an
environmental assessment worksheet by a responsible governmental unit selected by the board for
any action where environmental review under this section has not been specifically provided for by
rule or otherwise initiated.
    (f) An early and open process shall be utilized to limit the scope of the environmental impact
statement to a discussion of those impacts, which, because of the nature or location of the project,
have the potential for significant environmental effects. The same process shall be utilized to
determine the form, content and level of detail of the statement as well as the alternatives which
are appropriate for consideration in the statement. In addition, the permits which will be required
for the proposed action shall be identified during the scoping process. Further, the process shall
identify those permits for which information will be developed concurrently with the environmental
impact statement. The board shall provide in its rules for the expeditious completion of the scoping
process. The determinations reached in the process shall be incorporated into the order requiring
the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (g) The responsible governmental unit shall, to the extent practicable, avoid duplication and
ensure coordination between state and federal environmental review and between environmental
review and environmental permitting. Whenever practical, information needed by a governmental
unit for making final decisions on permits or other actions required for a proposed project shall be
developed in conjunction with the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (h) An environmental impact statement shall be prepared and its adequacy determined within
280 days after notice of its preparation unless the time is extended by consent of the parties or
by the governor for good cause. The responsible governmental unit shall determine the adequacy
of an environmental impact statement, unless within 60 days after notice is published that an
environmental impact statement will be prepared, the board chooses to determine the adequacy of
an environmental impact statement. If an environmental impact statement is found to be inadequate,
the responsible governmental unit shall have 60 days to prepare an adequate environmental impact
statement.
   (i) The proposer of a specific action may include in the information submitted to the responsible
governmental unit a preliminary draft environmental impact statement under this section on
92ND DAY]                          FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2012                                       5103

that action for review, modification, and determination of completeness and adequacy by the
responsible governmental unit. A preliminary draft environmental impact statement prepared by
the project proposer and submitted to the responsible governmental unit shall identify or include as
an appendix all studies and other sources of information used to substantiate the analysis contained
in the preliminary draft environmental impact statement. The responsible governmental unit shall
require additional studies, if needed, and obtain from the project proposer all additional studies and
information necessary for the responsible governmental unit to perform its responsibility to review,
modify, and determine the completeness and adequacy of the environmental impact statement.

whether the objectives of the metropolitan abatement plan have been met and whether each county
and each class of city within each county have achieved the objectives set for it in the plan. The
report must recommend any legislation that may be required to implement the plan. The report shall
be included in the report required by section 115A.411. If in any year the commissioner reports
that the objectives of the abatement plan have not been met, the commissioner shall evaluate and
report on the need to reassign governmental responsibilities among cities, counties, and metropolitan
agencies to assure implementation and achievement of the metropolitan and local abatement plans
and objectives.
    The report must include a report on the operating, capital, and debt service costs of solid waste
facilities in the metropolitan area; changes in the costs; the methods used to pay the costs; and the
resultant allocation of costs among users of the facilities and the general public. The facility costs
report must present the cost and financing analysis in the aggregate and broken down by county and
