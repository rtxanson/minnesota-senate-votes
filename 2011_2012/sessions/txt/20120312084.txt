The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
Dear Madam President:
   I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 129, Senate File 134, a bill to change the definition of
a public employee.
    This bill modifies a provision of the Public Employee Labor Relations Act (PELRA) that
defines which temporary or seasonal workers are considered public employees. Public employees
are afforded certain rights under PELRA, including the right to bargain for wages and benefits,
protection from dismissal without cause, and the right to file grievances against wrongful
employers. The particular change provided in this bill affects students who perform temporary or
seasonal work for public employers, including state agencies, schools, and municipalities.
    Current law states that certain fulltime students under the age of 22, who work for a public
employer for up to 100 days a year, are not public employees. This bill would exclude all fulltime
students, of any age, who are temporary or seasonal employees of a public employer, and who work
84TH DAY]                         MONDAY, MARCH 12, 2012                                        4273

for up to 100 days a year, from being public employees.
    According to the Minnesota Bureau of Meditation Services, this change in the law would have
several effects on older workers, which in my judgment, are harmful. Under this bill, students older
than the age of 22 would not be considered public employees and, therefore, would not be eligible for
the benefits contained in the labor agreement covering their positions, because the labor agreement
would only cover employees meeting the definition of a public employee.
    Among the rights and benefits for which they would not be eligible, are those benefits found in
collective bargaining agreements, which include: Health Care Benefits, Negotiated Wage Rates and
Negotiated Wage Increases, Vacation, Sick Leave, Job Protection (not being discharged without just
cause), Protection from Discipline without just cause, and Overtime.
    One of the reasons this age limitation is in statute, is to provide protections for workers beyond
the age where they often have health care coverage through their families. This bill puts in jeopardy
adults who happen to be in school but work temporary or seasonal jobs. They would find themselves
without insurance, benefits and other protections afforded other public employees.
    Current law balances the interests of students to access the rights and benefits of PELRA, while
providing public employers the flexibility to hire student employees for short term or seasonal
work. This change would result in a significant increase in temporary seasonal positions lacking
job protections and fringe benefits provided by PELRA. I cannot support it.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Mark Dayton, Governor
   Senator Senjem moved that S.F. No. 134 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table. The
motion prevailed.

section.
    A district shall grant academic credit to a pupil enrolled in a course for secondary credit if the
pupil successfully completes the course. Seven quarter or four semester college credits equal at
least one full year of high school credit. Fewer college credits may be prorated. A district must also
grant academic credit to a pupil enrolled in a course for postsecondary credit if secondary credit is
requested by a pupil. If no comparable course is offered by the district, the district must, as soon as
possible, notify the commissioner, who shall determine the number of credits that shall be granted
to a pupil who successfully completes a course. If a comparable course is offered by the district, the
school board shall grant a comparable number of credits to the pupil. If there is a dispute between
the district and the pupil regarding the number of credits granted for a particular course, the pupil
may appeal the board's decision to the commissioner. The commissioner's decision regarding the
number of credits shall be final.
    The secondary credits granted to a pupil must be counted toward the graduation requirements
and subject area requirements of the district. Evidence of successful completion of each course and
secondary credits granted must be included in the pupil's secondary school record. A pupil shall
provide the school with a copy of the pupil's grade in each course taken for secondary credit under
this section. Upon the request of a pupil, the pupil's secondary school record must also include
evidence of successful completion and credits granted for a course taken for postsecondary credit.
In either case, the record must indicate that the credits were earned at a postsecondary institution.
    If a pupil enrolls in a postsecondary institution after leaving secondary school, the postsecondary
institution must award postsecondary credit for any course successfully completed for secondary
credit at that institution. Other postsecondary institutions may award, after a pupil leaves secondary
school, postsecondary credit for any courses successfully completed under this section. An
institution may not charge a pupil for the award of credit.

secondary credit.
    The department must not make payments to a school district or postsecondary institution

postsecondary institution for a course from which a student officially withdraws during the first
14 days of the quarter or semester or who has been absent from the postsecondary institution for
the first 15 consecutive school days of the quarter or semester and is not receiving instruction in
the home or hospital.
    A postsecondary institution, including a college or university under subdivision 5a, shall receive
the following:
    (1) for an institution granting quarter credit, the reimbursement per credit hour shall be an amount
equal to 88 percent of the product of the formula allowance minus $415, multiplied by 1.3, and
divided by 45; or
   (2) for an institution granting semester credit, the reimbursement per credit hour shall be an
amount equal to 88 percent of the product of the general revenue formula allowance minus $415,
multiplied by 1.3, and divided by 30.
    The department must pay to each postsecondary institution 100 percent of the amount in clause
(1) or (2) within 30 days of receiving initial enrollment information each quarter or semester. If
changes in enrollment occur during a quarter or semester, the change shall be reported by the
postsecondary institution at the time the enrollment information for the succeeding quarter or
semester is submitted. At any time the department notifies a postsecondary institution that an
overpayment has been made, the institution shall promptly remit the amount due.

     Sec. 40. [97B.647] TAKING WOLVES.
   Subdivision 1. License required. Except as provided under section 97B.645 or 97B.671, a
person may not take a wolf without a wolf hunting or wolf trapping license.
    Subd. 2. Open seasons. Wolves may be taken with legal firearms, with bow and arrow, and by
trapping. The commissioner may by rule prescribe the open seasons for wolves.
    Subd. 3. Open areas. The commissioner may by rule designate areas where wolves may be
taken.
   Subd. 4. Daily and possession limits. The commissioner may establish by rule the daily and
possession limits for wolves.
    Subd. 5. Limit on number of hunters and trappers. The commissioner may by rule limit the
number of persons that may hunt or trap wolves in an area, if it is necessary to prevent an overharvest
or improve the distribution of hunters and trappers. The commissioner shall establish a method,
including a drawing, to impartially select the hunters and trappers for an area.
    Subd. 6. Application for license. An application for a wolf hunting or trapping license must
be made in a manner provided by the commissioner and accompanied by a $4 application fee.
The $4 application fee is appropriated to pay for costs associated with conducting the wolf license
drawing and wolf management. A person may not make more than one application for each season
as prescribed by the commissioner. If a person makes more than one application, the person is
ineligible for a license for that season after determination by the commissioner, without a hearing.
    Subd. 7. Quotas. The commissioner may by rule set an annual quota for the number of wolves
that can be taken by hunting and trapping. The commissioner may establish a method to monitor
harvest and close the season when the quota is reached. The commissioner shall reserve a portion
of the annual quota for the trapping season.
