   (18) pursuant to section 575.06, in connection with adverse claimants;
   (19) pursuant to sections 582.05 to 582.10, in connection with mortgage foreclosures; however,

   (20) pursuant to section 609.904, in connection with criminal penalties; or

    (d) Unless explicitly displaced by this chapter, the provisions of other statutory law and the

   Sec. 3. [576.23] POWERS OF THE COURT.
    The court has the exclusive authority to direct the receiver and the authority over all receivership
property wherever located including, without limitation, authority to determine all controversies
relating to the collection, preservation, improvement, disposition, and distribution of receivership
property, and all matters otherwise arising in or relating to the receivership, the receivership property,
the exercise of the receiver's powers, or the performance of the receiver's duties.
   Sec. 4. [576.24] TYPES OF RECEIVERSHIPS.
    A receivership may be either a limited receivership or a general receivership. Any receivership
which is based upon the enforcement of an assignment of rents or leases, or the foreclosure of a
mortgage lien, judgment lien, mechanic's lien, or other lien pursuant to which the respondent or any
holder of a lien would have a statutory right of redemption, shall be a limited receivership. If the
order appointing the receiver does not specify whether the receivership is a limited receivership or
a general receivership, the receivership shall be a limited receivership unless and until the court by
later order designates the receivership as a general receivership, notwithstanding that pursuant to
section 576.25, subdivision 8, a receiver may have control over all the property of the respondent.
At any time, the court may order a general receivership to be converted to a limited receivership
and a limited receivership to be converted to a general receivership.
   Sec. 5. [576.25] APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVERS; RECEIVERSHIP NOT A TRUST.
    Subdivision 1. No necessity of separate action. A receiver may be appointed under this chapter
whether or not the motion for appointment of a receiver is combined with, or is ancillary to, an
action seeking a money judgment.
   Subd. 2. Before judgment. Except where judgment for failure to answer may be had without
application to the court, a limited receiver may be appointed before judgment to protect any party
5194                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [95TH DAY

to an action who demonstrates an apparent right to property that is the subject of the action and is
in the possession of an adverse party, and that the property or its rents and profits are in danger of
loss or material impairment.
    Subd. 3. In a judgment or after judgment. A limited or general receiver may be appointed
in a judgment or after judgment to carry the judgment into effect, to preserve property pending an
appeal, or when an execution has been returned unsatisfied and the judgment debtor refuses to apply
the property in satisfaction of the judgment.
    Subd. 4. Entities. In addition to those situations specifically provided for in statute, a limited
or general receiver may be appointed when a corporation or other entity is dissolved, insolvent, in
imminent danger of insolvency, or has forfeited its corporate rights and in like cases of the property
within the state of foreign corporations and other entities.
   Subd. 5. Appointment of receiver of mortgaged property. (a) A limited receiver shall be
appointed at any time after the commencement of mortgage foreclosure proceedings under chapter
580 or 581 and before the end of the period for redemption, if the mortgage being foreclosed:
    (1) secures an original principal amount of $100,000 or more or is a lien upon residential real
estate containing more than four dwelling units; and
   (2) is not a lien upon property that was entirely homesteaded, residential real estate containing
four or fewer dwelling units where at least one unit is homesteaded; or agricultural property.
The foreclosing mortgagee or the purchaser at foreclosure sale may at any time bring an action in
the district court of the county in which the mortgaged property or any part thereof is located for
the appointment of a receiver; provided, however, if the foreclosure is by action under chapter 581,
a separate action need not be filed.
   (b) The court shall appoint a receiver upon a showing that the mortgagor has breached a covenant
contained in the mortgage relating to any of the following:
   (1) application of tenant security deposits as required by section 504B.178;
    (2) payment when due of prior or current real estate taxes or special assessments with respect to
the mortgaged property or the periodic escrow for the payment of the taxes or special assessments;
    (3) payment when due of premiums for insurance of the type required by the mortgage or the
periodic escrow for the payment of the premiums; or
   (4) keeping of the covenants required of a landlord or licensor pursuant to section 504B.161,
subdivision 1.
   (c) The receiver shall be or shall retain an experienced property manager.
    (d) The receiver shall collect the rents, profits, and all other income of any kind. The receiver,
after providing for payment of its reasonable fees and expenses, shall, to the extent possible and in
the order determined by the receiver to preserve the value of the mortgaged property:
   (1) manage the mortgaged property so as to prevent waste;
   (2) execute contracts and leases within the period of the receivership, or beyond the period of
95TH DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, MARCH 28, 2012                                        5195

the receivership if approved by the court;
     (3) pay the expenses listed in paragraph (b), clauses (1) to (3);
     (4) pay all expenses for normal maintenance of the mortgaged property; and
     (5) perform the terms of any assignment of rents that complies with section 559.17, subdivision
2.
    (e) The purchaser at a foreclosure sale shall have the right, at any time and without limitation
as provided in section 582.03, to advance money to the receiver to pay any or all of the expenses
that the receiver should otherwise pay if cash were available from the mortgaged property. Sums so
advanced, with interest, shall be a part of the sum required to be paid to redeem from the sale. The
sums shall be proved by the affidavit of the purchaser, an agent, or attorney, stating the expenses
and describing the mortgaged property. The affidavit shall be furnished to the sheriff in the manner
of expenses claimed under section 582.03.
    (f) Any sums collected that remain in the possession of the receiver at the termination of the
receivership shall, in the event the termination of the receivership is due to the reinstatement of the
mortgage debt or redemption of the mortgaged property by the mortgagor, be paid to the mortgagor;
and in the event termination of the receivership occurs at the end of the period of redemption without
redemption by the mortgagor or any other party entitled to redeem, interest accrued upon the sale
price pursuant to section 580.23 or 581.10 shall be paid to the purchaser at the foreclosure sale. Any
net sum remaining shall be paid to the mortgagor, except if the receiver was enforcing an assignment
of rents that complies with section 559.17, subdivision 2, in which case any net sum remaining shall
be paid pursuant to the terms of the assignment.
    (g) This subdivision applies to all mortgages executed on or after August 1, 1977, and to
amendments or modifications thereto, and to amendments or modifications made on or after August
1, 1977, to mortgages executed before August 1, 1977, if the amendment or modification is duly

accord with existing practice, except as otherwise prescribed.
    Subd. 7. Motion for appointment of receiver. The court may appoint a receiver upon a motion
with notice to the respondent, to all other parties in the action, and to parties in interest and other
persons as the court may require. Notice shall also be given to any judgment creditor who is seeking
the appointment of a receiver in any other action. A motion to appoint a general receiver shall be
treated as a dispositive motion. The court may appoint a receiver ex parte or on shortened notice on a
temporary basis if it is clearly shown that an emergency exists requiring the immediate appointment
of a receiver. In that event, the court shall set a hearing as soon as practicable and at the subsequent
hearing, the burdens of proof shall be as would be applicable to a motion made on notice that is not
expedited.
    Subd. 8. Description of receivership property. The order appointing the receiver or subsequent
order shall describe the receivership property with particularity appropriate to the circumstances. If
the order does not so describe the receivership property, until further order of the court, the receiver
shall have control over all of the respondent's nonexempt property.
     Subd. 9. Receivership not a trust. The order appointing the receiver does not create a trust.

   Sec. 6. [576.26] ELIGIBILITY OF RECEIVER.
    Subdivision 1. Who may serve as receiver. Unless otherwise prohibited by law or prior order,
any person, whether or not a resident of this state, may serve as a receiver, provided that the court,
in its order appointing the receiver, makes written conclusions based in the record that the person
proposed as receiver:
   (1) is qualified to serve as receiver and as an officer of the court; and
   (2) is independent as to the parties and the underlying dispute.
    Subd. 2. Considerations regarding qualifications. (a) In determining whether a proposed
receiver is qualified to serve as receiver and as an officer of the court, the court shall consider any
relevant information, including, but not limited to, whether:
    (1) the proposed receiver has knowledge and experience sufficient to perform the duties of
receiver;
   (2) the proposed receiver has the financial ability to post the bond required by section 576.07;
   (3) the proposed receiver or any insider of the proposed receiver has been previously disqualified
from serving as receiver and the reasons for disqualification;
    (4) the proposed receiver or any insider of the proposed receiver has been convicted of a felony
or other crime involving moral turpitude; and
   (5) the proposed receiver or any insider of the proposed receiver has been found liable in a civil
court for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, civil theft, or similar misconduct.
   (b) For the purposes of this subdivision, "insider" includes:
    (1) if the proposed receiver is a corporation, an officer or director of the corporation, or a person
in control of the proposed receiver; and
   (2) if the proposed receiver is a partnership, a general or limited partner of the partnership, or a
person in control of the proposed receiver.
    Subd. 3. Considerations regarding independence. (a) In determining whether a proposed
receiver is independent as to the parties and the underlying dispute, the court shall consider any
relevant information, including, but not limited to:
    (1) the nature and extent of any relationship that the proposed receiver has to the parties and
the property proposed as receivership property including, without limitation, whether the proposed
receiver is a party to the action, a family member of a party to the action, or an officer, director,
member, employee, or owner of or controls a party to the action;
    (2) whether the proposed receiver has any interest materially adverse to the interests of any of
the parties to the action;
    (3) whether the proposed receiver has any material financial or pecuniary interest, other than
receiver compensation allowed by court order, in the outcome of the underlying dispute, including
any proposed contingent or success fee compensation arrangement; and

    (4) whether the proposed receiver is a debtor, secured or unsecured creditor, lienor of, or holder
of any equity interest in, any of the parties to the action of the receivership property.
    (b) In evaluating all information, the court may exercise its discretion and need not consider any
single item of information to be determinative of independence. Without limiting the generality of
the preceding sentence, the proposed receiver shall not be disqualified solely because the proposed
receiver was appointed receiver in other unrelated matters involving any of the parties to the matter
in which the appointment is sought, or the proposed receiver has been engaged by any of the parties
to the action in matters unrelated to the underlying action.
    Subd. 4. Information provided to court. The proposed receiver, the parties, and prospective
parties in interest may provide any information relevant to the qualifications, independence, and the
selection of the receiver.

the court shall order in its discretion consistent with section 574.11. Unless otherwise ordered by
the court, the receiver's bond shall be conditioned on the receiver's faithful discharge of its duties in
accordance with the orders of the court and the laws of this state. The receiver shall execute a bond
with a surety authorized to write bonds in the state.

action against a receiver to recover receivership property or the value thereof.
    (c) A party or party in interest may conduct discovery of the receiver concerning any matter
relating to the receiver's administration of the receivership property after obtaining an order
authorizing the discovery.

property, a notice of lis pendens shall be recorded as soon as practicable with the county recorder or

receiver's duties, the receiver may employ attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, and
other professionals that do not hold or represent an interest adverse to the receivership.
    (b) This section does not require prior court approval for the retention of professionals. However,
any professional to be retained shall provide the receiver with a disclosure of any potential conflicts

retention within 21 days after the filing of the notice of retention.
   (c) A person is not disqualified for employment under this section solely because of the person's

other party in interest if the court determines that the employment is appropriate.
    Subd. 2. Compensation. (a) The receiver and any professional retained by the receiver shall

   (1) the activities of the receiver since the last report;
    (2) cash receipts and disbursements, including payments made to professionals retained by the
receiver;
   (3) receipts and dispositions of receivership property; and
   (4) other matters.
   (b) The order may provide for the delivery of the receiver's interim reports to persons on the
master service list and to other persons and may provide a procedure for objection to the interim

   Sec. 18. [576.38] TERMINATION OF RECEIVERSHIPS; FINAL REPORT.
    Subdivision 1. Termination of receivership. The court may discharge a receiver and terminate

RECEIVERSHIP PROPERTY.
   Subdivision 1. Actions by or against receiver. The receiver may sue in the receiver's capacity

and, subject to other sections of this chapter and all immunities provided at common law, may be
sued in that capacity.
    Subd. 2. Venue. Unless applicable law requires otherwise or the court orders otherwise, an action
by or against the receiver or relating to the receivership or receivership property shall be commenced
in the court and assigned to the judge before whom the receivership is pending.
    Subd. 3. Joinder. Subject to section 576.42, a limited or general receiver may be joined or
substituted as a party in any action or other proceeding that relates to receivership property that was
pending at the time of appointment. Subject to other sections of this chapter, a general receiver may
be joined or substituted as a party in any action or other proceeding that was pending at the time
of appointment in which the respondent is a party. Pending actions may be transferred to the court
upon the receiver's motion for change of venue made in the court in which the action is pending.
    Subd. 4. Effect of judgments. A judgment entered subsequent to the time of appointment
against a receiver or the respondent shall not constitute a lien on receivership property, nor shall
any execution issue thereon. Upon submission of a certified copy of the judgment in accordance
with section 576.49, the amount of the judgment shall be treated as an allowed claim in a general
receivership. A judgment against a limited receiver shall have the same effect as a judgment against
the respondent, except that the judgment shall be enforceable against receivership property only to
the extent ordered by the court.
   Sec. 20. [576.40] TURNOVER OF PROPERTY.
    Subdivision 1. Demand by receiver. Except as expressly provided in this section, and unless
otherwise ordered by the court, upon demand by a receiver, any person shall turn over any
receivership property that is within the possession or control of that person. Unless ordered by the
court, a person in possession of receivership property pursuant to a valid lien perfected prior to the
time of appointment is not required to turn over receivership property.
    Subd. 2. Motion by receiver. A receiver may seek to compel turnover of receivership property
by motion in the receivership. If there exists a bona fide dispute with respect to the existence or
nature of the receiver's or the respondent's interest in the property, turnover shall be sought by means
of an action under section 576.39. In the absence of a bona fide dispute with respect to the receiver's
or the respondent's right to possession of receivership property, the failure to relinquish possession
and control to the receiver may be punishable as contempt of the court.
   Sec. 21. [576.41] ANCILLARY RECEIVERSHIPS.
    Subdivision 1. Ancillary receiverships in foreign jurisdictions. A receiver appointed by a
court of this state may, without first seeking approval of the court, apply in any foreign jurisdiction
for appointment as receiver with respect to any receivership property which is located within the
foreign jurisdiction.
    Subd. 2. Ancillary receiverships in the courts of this state. (a) A foreign receiver may obtain
appointment by a court of this state as a receiver in an ancillary receivership with respect to any
property located in or subject to the jurisdiction of the court if (1) the foreign receiver would be
eligible to serve as receiver under section 576.26, and (2) the appointment is in furtherance of the
foreign receiver's possession, control, or disposition of property subject to the foreign receivership
and in accordance with orders of the foreign jurisdiction.
5204                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [95TH DAY

    (b) The courts of this state may enter any order necessary to effectuate orders entered by
the foreign jurisdiction's receivership proceeding. Unless the court orders otherwise, a receiver
appointed in an ancillary receivership in this state shall have the powers and duties of a limited
receiver as set forth in this chapter and shall otherwise comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to limited receivers.

   Subdivision 1. Control of property. All receivership property is under the control and
supervision of the court appointing the receiver.

a stay or stays to protect receivership property and to facilitate the administration of the receivership.
   Subd. 3. Stay in all receiverships. Except as otherwise ordered by the court, the entry of an
order appointing a receiver shall operate as a stay, applicable to all persons, of:
   (1) any act to obtain possession of receivership property, or to interfere with or exercise
control over receivership property, other than the commencement or continuation of a judicial,
administrative, or other action or proceeding, including the issuance or use of process, to enforce
any lien having priority over the rights of the receiver in receivership property; and
    (2) any act to create or perfect any lien against receivership property, except by exercise of a
right of setoff, to the extent that the lien secures a claim that arose before the time of appointment.
    Subd. 4. Limited additional stay in general receiverships. (a) Except as otherwise ordered by
the court, in addition to the stay provided in subdivision 3, the entry of an order appointing a general
receiver shall operate as a stay, applicable to all persons, of:

proceeding, including the issuance or use of process, against the respondent or the receiver that
was or could have been commenced before the time of appointment, or to recover a claim against
the respondent that arose before the time of appointment;
    (2) the commencement or continuation of a judicial, administrative, or other action or
proceeding, including the issuance or use of process, to enforce any lien having priority over the
rights of the receiver in receivership property.
    (b) As to the acts specified in this subdivision, the stay shall expire 30 days after the time
of appointment unless, before the expiration of the 30-day period, the receiver or other party in
interest files a motion seeking an order of the court extending the stay and before the expiration of
an additional 30 days following the 30-day period, the court orders the stay extended.
   Subd. 5. Modification of stay. The court may modify any stay provided in this section upon the
motion of any party in interest affected by the stay.
    Subd. 6. Inapplicability of stay. The entry of an order appointing a receiver does not operate
as a stay of:
   (1) the commencement or continuation of a criminal proceeding against the respondent;
   (2) the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to
95TH DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, MARCH 28, 2012                                          5205

enforce its police or regulatory power;
   (3) the enforcement of a judgment, other than a money judgment, obtained in an action or
proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce its police or regulatory power, or with respect to
any licensure of the respondent;
   (4) the establishment by a governmental unit of any tax liability and any appeal thereof;
   (5) the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding to establish paternity;
to establish or modify an order for alimony, maintenance, or support; or to collect alimony,
maintenance, or support under any order of a court;
   (6) the exercise of a right of setoff;
    (7) any act to maintain or continue the perfection of a lien on, or otherwise preserve or protect
rights in, receivership property, but only to the extent that the act was necessary to preserve or protect
the lien or other rights as they existed as of the time of the appointment. If the act would require
seizure of receivership property or commencement of an action prohibited by a stay, the continued
perfection shall instead be accomplished by filing a notice in the court before which the receivership
is pending and by serving the notice upon the receiver and receiver's attorney, if any, within the time
fixed by law for seizure or commencement of the action;
   (8) the commencement of a bankruptcy case under federal bankruptcy laws; or
    (9) any other exception as provided in United States Code, title 11, section 326(b), as to the
automatic stay in federal bankruptcy cases to the extent not inconsistent with any provision in this
section.
   Sec. 23. [576.43] UTILITY SERVICE.
    A utility providing service to receivership property that has received written notice from the
receiver of the appointment of the receiver may not alter, refuse, or discontinue service to the
receivership property without first giving the receiver written notice of any receivership default
in compliance with the utility's approved tariffs. After written notice to the utility and a hearing
satisfactory to the court, the court may prohibit the alteration, refusal, or discontinuance of utility
service if the receiver furnishes adequate assurance of payment for service to be provided after the
time of appointment.
   Sec. 24. [576.44] RECEIVERSHIP FINANCING.
    (a) Without necessity of a court order, the receiver may obtain unsecured credit and incur
unsecured debt on behalf of the receivership, and the amounts shall be allowable as expenses of
the receivership under section 576.51, subdivision 1, clause (2).
    (b) Without necessity of a court order, the receiver may obtain secured financing on behalf of the
receivership from any secured party under a financing facility existing at the time of the appointment.
   (c) The court may authorize the receiver to obtain credit or incur indebtedness, and the court
may authorize the receiver to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise encumber receivership
property as security for repayment of any indebtedness.
   Sec. 25. [576.45] EXECUTORY CONTRACTS.
5206                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [95TH DAY

    Subdivision 1. Performance by receiver. Unless a court orders otherwise, a receiver succeeds to
all of the rights and duties of the respondent under any executory contract. The court may condition
the continued performance by the receiver on terms that are appropriate under the circumstances.
Performance of an executory contract shall create a claim against the receivership to the extent of
the value of the performance received by the receivership after the time of appointment. The claim
shall not constitute a personal obligation of the receiver.
    Subd. 2. Assignment and delegation by receiver. For good cause, the court may authorize a
receiver to assign and delegate an executory contract to a third party under the same circumstances
and under the same conditions as the respondent was permitted to do so pursuant to the terms of the
executory contract and applicable law immediately before the time of appointment.
    Subd. 3. Termination by receiver. For good cause, the court may authorize the receiver to
terminate an executory contract. The receiver's right to possess or use property pursuant to the
executory contract shall terminate at the termination of the executory contract. Except as to the
claim against the receivership under subdivision 1, the termination shall create a claim equal to
the damages, if any, for a breach of contract as if the breach of contract had occurred immediately
before the time of appointment. Any claim arising under this section for termination of an executory
contract shall be presented or filed in the same manner as other claims in the receivership no later
than the later of: (1) the time set for filing of claims in the receivership; or (2) 28 days after the
notice by the receiver of the termination of the executory contract.
  Sec. 26. [576.46]          SALES      FREE      AND      CLEAR       OF    LIEN     IN    GENERAL
RECEIVERSHIPS.
    Subdivision 1. Sales free and clear of liens. (a) The court may order that a general receiver's
sale of receivership property is free and clear of all liens, except any lien for unpaid real estate taxes
or assessments and liens arising under federal law, and may be free of the rights of redemption of
the respondent if the rights of redemption are receivership property and the rights of redemption
of the holders of any liens, regardless of whether the sale will generate proceeds sufficient to fully
satisfy all liens on the property, unless either:
    (1) the property is (i) real property classified as agricultural land under section 273.13,
subdivision 23, or the property is a homestead under section 510.01; and (ii) each of the owners of
the property has not consented to the sale following the time of appointment; or
   (2) any owner of the property or holder of a lien on the property serves and files a timely
objection, and the court determines that the amount likely to be realized from the sale by the
objecting person is less than the objecting person would realize within a reasonable time in the
absence of this sale.
    (b) The receiver shall have the burden of proof to establish that the amount likely to be realized
by the objecting person from the sale is equal to or more than the objecting person would realize
within a reasonable time in the absence of the sale.
    (c) Upon any sale free and clear of liens authorized by this section, all liens encumbering the
property conveyed shall transfer and attach to the proceeds of the sale, net of reasonable expenses
approved by the court incurred in the disposition of the property, in the same order, priority, and
validity as the liens had with respect to the property immediately before the sale. The court may
authorize the receiver to satisfy, in whole or in part, any ownership interest or lien out of the proceeds
95TH DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, MARCH 28, 2012                                          5207

of the sale if the ownership interest or lien of any party in interest would not thereby be impaired.
    Subd. 2. Co-owned property. If any receivership property includes an interest as a co-owner of
property, the receiver shall have the rights and powers afforded by applicable state or federal law
of the respondent, including but not limited to any rights of partition, but may not sell the property
free and clear of the co-owner's interest in the property.
    Subd. 3. Right to credit bid. A creditor with a claim secured by a valid and perfected lien
against the property to be sold may bid on the property at a sale and may offset against the purchase
price part or all of the amount secured by its lien, provided that the creditor tenders cash sufficient
to satisfy in full the reasonable expenses, approved by the court, incurred in the disposition of the
property and all liens payable out of the proceeds of sale having priority over the lien of that creditor.
   Subd. 4. Effect of appeal. The reversal or modification on appeal of an authorization to sell
property under this section does not affect the validity of a sale to a person that purchased the
property in good faith, whether or not the person knew of the pendency of the appeal, unless the
authorization and sale is stayed pending the appeal.
   Sec. 27. [576.47] ABANDONMENT OF PROPERTY.
    The court may authorize the receiver to abandon any receivership property that is burdensome
or is not of material value to the receivership. Property that is abandoned is no longer receivership
property.
   Sec. 28. [576.48] LIENS AGAINST AFTER-ACQUIRED PROPERTY.
    Except as otherwise provided for by statute, property that becomes receivership property after
the time of appointment is subject to a lien to the same extent as it would have been in the absence
of the receivership.
   Sec. 29. [576.49] CLAIMS PROCESS.
    Subdivision 1. Recommendation of receiver. In a general receivership, and in a limited
receivership if the circumstances require, the receiver shall submit to the court a recommendation
concerning a claims process appropriate to the particular receivership.
    Subd. 2. Order establishing process. In a general receivership and, if the court orders, in a
limited receivership, the court shall establish the claims process to be followed in the receivership
addressing whether proofs of claim must be submitted, the form of any proofs of claim, the place
where the proofs of claim must be submitted, the deadline or deadlines for submitting the proofs of
claim, and other matters bearing on the claims process.
    Subd. 3. Alternative procedures. The court may authorize proofs of claim to be filed with the
receiver rather than the court. The court may authorize the receiver to treat claims as allowed claims
based on the amounts established in the books and records of the respondent or the schedule of
claims filed pursuant to section 576.33, without necessity of formal proofs of claim.
   Sec. 30. [576.50] OBJECTION TO AND ALLOWANCE OF CLAIMS.
    Subdivision 1. Objections and allowance. The receiver or any party in interest may file a motion
objecting to a claim and stating the grounds for the objection. The court may order that a copy
of the objection be served on the persons on the master service list at least 30 days prior to the
5208                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [95TH DAY

hearing. Claims allowed by court order, and claims properly submitted and not disallowed by the
court shall be allowed claims and shall be entitled to share in distributions of receivership property
in accordance with the priorities provided by this chapter or otherwise by law.
    Subd. 2. Examination of claims. If the claims process does not require proofs of claim to be
filed with the court, at any time after expiration of the claim-filing period and upon 14 days' written
notice to the receiver, any party in interest shall have the right to examine:
   (1) all claims filed with the receiver; and
    (2) all books and records in the receiver's possession that provided the receiver the basis
for concluding that creditors identified therein are entitled to participate in any distributions of
receivership property without having to file claims.
   Subd. 3. Estimation of claims. For the purpose of allowance of claims, the court may estimate:
    (1) any contingent or unliquidated claim, the fixing or liquidation of which would unduly delay
the administration of the receivership; or
   (2) any right to payment arising from a right to an equitable remedy.
   Sec. 31. [576.51] PRIORITY OF CLAIMS.
    Subdivision 1. Priorities. Allowed claims shall receive distribution under this chapter in the
following order of priority and, except as set forth in clause (1), on a pro rata basis:
    (1) claims secured by liens on receivership property, which liens are valid and perfected
before the time of appointment, to the extent of the proceeds from the disposition of the collateral
in accordance with their respective priorities under otherwise applicable law, subject first to
reimbursing the receiver for the reasonable and necessary expenses of preserving, protecting, or
disposing of the collateral, including allowed fees and reimbursement of reasonable expenses of
the receiver and professionals;
   (2) actual, necessary costs and expenses incurred during the receivership, other than those
expenses allowable under clause (1), including allowed fees and reimbursement of reasonable
expenses of the receiver and professionals employed by the receiver under section 576.32;
    (3) claims for wages, salaries, or commissions, including vacation, severance, and sick leave
pay, or contributions to an employee benefit plan, earned by the claimant within the 90 days before
the time of appointment or the cessation of the respondent's business, whichever occurs first, but
only to the extent of the dollar amount in effect in United States Code, title 11, section 507(4);
     (4) allowed unsecured claims, to the extent of the dollar amount in effect in United States Code,
title 11, section 507(7) for each individual, arising from the deposit with the respondent, before the
time of appointment of the receiver, of money in connection with the purchase, lease, or rental of
property or the purchase of services for personal, family, or household use by individuals that were
not delivered or provided;
   (5) claims for arrears in amounts owing pursuant to a support order as defined in section 518A.26,
subdivision 3;
   (6) unsecured claims of governmental units for taxes that accrued before the time of appointment
95TH DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, MARCH 28, 2012                                         5209

of the receiver;
   (7) all other unsecured claims due as of the time of appointment, including the balance due the
holders of secured claims to the extent not satisfied under clause (1); and
   (8) interest pursuant to section 576.52.
   Subd. 2. Payments to respondent. If all of the amounts payable under subdivision 1 have been
paid in full, any remaining receivership property shall be returned to the respondent.
   Sec. 32. [576.52] INTEREST ON UNSECURED CLAIMS.
    To the extent that funds are available to pay holders of allowed unsecured claims in full or the
amounts due as of the time of appointment, each holder shall also be entitled to receive interest,
calculated from the time of appointment, at the rate set forth in the agreement evidencing the claim,
or if no rate is provided, at the judgment rate that would be payable as of the time of appointment;
provided however, that no holder shall be entitled to interest on that portion, if any, of its unsecured
claim that is itself interest calculated from the time of appointment. If there are not sufficient funds
in the receivership to pay in full the interest owed to all the holders, then the interest shall be paid
pro rata.
   Sec. 33. [576.53] DISTRIBUTIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Proposed distributions. Before any interim or final distribution is made, the
receiver shall file a distribution schedule listing the proposed distributions. The distribution schedule
may be filed at any time during the case or may be included in the final report.
   Subd. 2. Notice. The receiver shall give notice of the filing of the distribution schedule to all
persons on the master mailing list or that have filed proofs of claim. If there is no objection within 21
days after the notice, the court may enter an order authorizing the receiver to make the distributions
described in the distribution schedule without the necessity of a hearing.
    Subd. 3. Other distributions. In the order appointing the receiver or in subsequent orders, the
court may authorize distribution of receivership property to persons with ownership interests or
liens.

property, the assignment shall be effective as a deed, and a notice of a lis pendens shall be recorded
as soon as practicable with the county recorder or registrar of titles, as appropriate, of the county
in which the real property is located. The priority of the assignee as lien creditor against real
property shall be from the time of recording of the notice of lis pendens, except as to persons with
actual or implied knowledge of the assignment under section 507.34. The assignment executed
by the assignor and certified by the court administrator and a deed executed by the assignee shall
be recorded with the county recorder or registrar of titles, as appropriate, of the county in which

PROCEEDINGS.
     The involuntary or supervised voluntary dissolution of a cooperative may be discontinued at any
time during the dissolution proceedings if it is established that cause for dissolution does not exist.
The court shall dismiss the proceedings and direct the receiver, if any, to redeliver to the cooperative

     Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 316.11, is amended to read:
     316.11 RECEIVER, APPOINTMENT, DUTIES.
      In any action or proceeding to dissolve a corporation, the court, at any time before judgment, or
within three years after judgment, of dissolution, may appoint a receiver to take charge of its estate
and effects and to collect the debts and property due and belonging to it, with, in addition to the
powers set forth in chapter 576, power to prosecute and defend actions in its name or otherwise, to
appoint agents, and do all other acts necessary to the final settlement of the unfinished business of the
corporation which it might do if in being. The power of such receiver shall continue so long as the
court deems necessary for such purposes. The receiver shall pay all debts due from the corporation,
if the funds in hand are sufficient therefor; and, if not, ­                       sh­­

business of the corporation and to sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all or any of the assets
of the corporation at a public or private sale.

some specified event, and a showing is made that the event has occurred, the court shall, without
regard to waste, adequacy of the security, or solvency of the mortgagor, appoint a receiver who

the interest sought to be disclaimed or contracts to do so;
   (3) the portion of the interest sought to be disclaimed is sold pursuant to a judicial sale; or
   (4) the disclaimant is insolvent when the disclaimer becomes irrevocable.
    (c) Acceptance of a distribution from a trust shall constitute acceptance of only that portion of
the beneficial interest in that trust that has been distributed, and shall not constitute acceptance or
bar disclaimer of that portion of the beneficial interest in the trust that has not yet been distributed.

  524.2-1107 POWER             TO     DISCLAIM;        GENERAL         REQUIREMENTS;             WHEN
IRREVOCABLE.
    (a) A person may disclaim, in whole or in part, any interest in or power over property, including
a power of appointment. A person may disclaim the interest or power even if its creator imposed
a spendthrift provision or similar restriction on transfer or a restriction or limitation on the right to
disclaim.

    (b) With court approval, a fiduciary may disclaim, in whole or in part, any interest in or power
over property, including a power of appointment when acting in a representative capacity. Without
court approval, a fiduciary may disclaim, in whole or in part, any interest in or power over property,
including a power of appointment, if and to the extent that the instrument creating the fiduciary
relationship explicitly grants the fiduciary the right to disclaim. With court approval, a custodial
parent may disclaim on behalf of a minor child for whom no conservator has been appointed, in
whole or in part, any interest in or power over property, including a power of appointment, which
the minor child is to receive.
    (c) To be effective, a disclaimer must be in writing, declare the writing as a disclaimer, describe
the interest or power disclaimed, and be signed by the person or fiduciary making the disclaimer
and acknowledged in the manner provided for deeds of real estate to be recorded in this state. In
addition, for a disclaimer to be effective, an original of the disclaimer must be delivered or filed in
the manner provided in section 524.2-1114.
   (d) A partial disclaimer may be expressed as a fraction, percentage, monetary amount, specific
property, term of years, portion of a beneficial interest in or right to distributions from a trust,
limitation of a power, or any other interest or estate in the property.
   (e) A disclaimer becomes irrevocable when the disclaimer is delivered or filed pursuant to section
524.2-1114 or it becomes effective as provided in sections 524.2-1108 to 524.2-1113, whichever
occurs later.
    (f) A disclaimer made under sections 524.2-1101 to 524.2-1116 is not a transfer, assignment, or
release.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 524.2-1114, is amended to read:
   524.2-1114 DELIVERY OR FILING.
     (a) Subject to paragraphs (b) to (l), delivery of a disclaimer may be effective by personal delivery,
first-class mail, or any other method that results in its receipt. A disclaimer sent by first-class mail
is deemed to have been delivered on the date it is postmarked. Delivery by any other method is
effective upon receipt by the person to whom the disclaimer is to be delivered under this section.
    (b) In the case of a disclaimer of an interest created under the law of intestate succession or an
interest created by will, other than an interest in a testamentary trust:
   (1) the disclaimer must be delivered to the personal representative of the decedent's estate; or
    (2) if no personal representative is serving when the disclaimer is sought to be delivered, the
disclaimer must be filed with the clerk of the court in any county where venue of administration
would be proper.
   (c) In the case of a disclaimer of an interest in a testamentary trust:
    (1) the disclaimer must be delivered to the trustee serving when the disclaimer is delivered or,
if no trustee is then serving, to the personal representative of the decedent's estate; or
    (2) if no personal representative is serving when the disclaimer is sought to be delivered, the
disclaimer must be filed with the clerk of the court in any county where venue of administration of
the decedent's estate would be proper.

   (d) In the case of a disclaimer of an interest in an inter vivos trust:
   (1) the disclaimer must be delivered to the trustee serving when the disclaimer is delivered;
    (2) if no trustee is then serving, it must be filed with the clerk of the court in any county where
the filing of a notice of trust would be proper; or
    (3) if the disclaimer is made before the time the instrument creating the trust becomes
irrevocable, the disclaimer must be delivered to the person with the power to revoke the revocable
trust or the transferor of the interest or to such person's legal representative.
    (e) In the case of a disclaimer of an interest created by a beneficiary designation made before the
time the designation becomes irrevocable, the disclaimer must be delivered to the person making
the beneficiary designation or to such person's legal representative.
    (f) In the case of a disclaimer of an interest created by a beneficiary designation made after the
time the designation becomes irrevocable, the disclaimer must be delivered to the person obligated
to distribute the interest.
     (g) In the case of a disclaimer by a surviving holder of jointly held property, the disclaimer
must be delivered to the person to whom the disclaimed interest passes or, if such person cannot
reasonably be located by the disclaimant, the disclaimer must be delivered as provided in paragraph
(b).
   (h) In the case of a disclaimer by an object, or taker in default of exercise, of a power of
appointment at any time after the power was created, the disclaimer must be delivered to:
   (1) the holder of the power; or
    (2) the fiduciary acting under the instrument that created the power or, if no fiduciary is serving
when the disclaimer is sought to be delivered, filed with a court having authority to appoint the
fiduciary.
    (i) In the case of a disclaimer by an appointee of a nonfiduciary power of appointment, the
disclaimer must be delivered to:
   (1) the holder of the power or the personal representative of the holder's estate; or
    (2) the fiduciary under the instrument that created the power or, if no fiduciary is serving when
the disclaimer is sought to be delivered, filed with a court having authority to appoint the fiduciary.
   (j) In the case of a disclaimer by a fiduciary of a power over a trust or estate, the disclaimer must
be delivered as provided in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) as if the power disclaimed were an interest in
property.
    (k) In the case of a disclaimer of a power exercisable by an agent, other than a power exercisable
by a fiduciary over a trust or estate, the disclaimer must be delivered to the principal or the principal's
representative.
    (l) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), delivery of a disclaimer of an interest in or relating to real
estate shall be presumed upon the recording of the disclaimer in the office of the ­ c­e

     (m) A fiduciary or other person having custody of the disclaimed interest is not liable for any
otherwise proper distribution or other disposition made without actual notice of the disclaimer or,
if the disclaimer is barred under section 524.2-1106, for any otherwise proper distribution or other
disposition made in reliance on the disclaimer, if the distribution or disposition is made without
actual knowledge of the facts constituting the bar of the right to disclaim.
    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 524.2-1115, is amended to read:
    524.2-1115 RECORDING OF DISCLAIMER RELATING TO REAL ESTATE.

results related to the peer grouping system that identify hospitals, clinics, or other providers only if
the following criteria are met:
   (1) the results, data, and summaries, including any graphical depictions of provider performance,
have been distributed to providers at least 120 days prior to publication;
   (2) the commissioner has provided an opportunity for providers to verify and review data for
which the provider is the subject consistent with the recommendations developed pursuant to
subdivision 3c, paragraph (d), and adopted by the commissioner;
   (3) the results meet thresholds of validity, reliability, statistical significance, representativeness,
and other standards that reflect the recommendations of the advisory committee, established under
subdivision 3; and
    (4) any public report or other usage of the analyses, report, or data used by the state clearly
notifies consumers about how to use and interpret the results, including any limitations of the data
and analysis.
   ­(g
     ­­) (c) After publishing the first public report, the commissioner shall, no less frequently than
annually, publish information on providers' total cost, total resource use, total quality, and the
results of the total care portion of the peer grouping process, as well as information on providers'
condition-specific cost, condition-specific resource use, and condition-specific quality, and the
results of the condition-specific portion of the peer grouping process. The results that are published
must be on a risk-adjusted basis, including case mix adjustments.
    (d) The commissioner shall convene a work group comprised of representatives of physician
clinics, hospitals, their respective statewide associations, and other relevant stakeholder
organizations to make recommendations on data to be made available to hospitals and physician
clinics to allow for verification of the accuracy and representativeness of the provider peer grouping
results.
