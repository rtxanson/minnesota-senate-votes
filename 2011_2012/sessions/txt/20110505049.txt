by or solely for the benefit of a physically disabled person:
    (1) in a designated parking space for disabled persons, as provided in section 169.346;

passenger vehicles but restricted to a maximum period of time and that does not specifically prohibit
the exercise of disabled parking privileges in that space.
A person may park a motor vehicle for a physically disabled person in a parking space described in
clause (1) or (2) only when actually transporting the physically disabled person for the sole benefit
of that person and when the parking space is within a reasonable distance from the drop-off point.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, a certificate is prominently displayed if it is displayed so
that it may be viewed from the front and rear of the motor vehicle by hanging it from the rearview
mirror attached to the front windshield of the motor vehicle. If there is no rearview mirror or if
the certificate holder's disability precludes placing the certificate on the mirror, the certificate must

in areas prohibited by sections 169.32 and 169.34, in designated no parking spaces, or in parking
spaces reserved for specified purposes or vehicles. A local governmental unit may, by ordinance,

must be enforced in the same manner as parking ordinances or regulations in the governmental
subdivision in which the violation occurs. Law enforcement officers may tag motor vehicles parked
on either private or public property in violation of subdivision 1. Parking enforcement employees
or agents of statutory or home rule charter cities or towns may tag or otherwise issue citations for
motor vehicles parked on public property in violation of subdivision 1. If a holder of a disability
certificate or disability plates allows a person who is not otherwise eligible to use the certificate
or plates, then the holder is not eligible to be issued or to use a disability certificate or plates for
12 months after the date of violation. Except when the permit or certificate is expired by, or is
otherwise invalid for, more than 90 days, a physically disabled person, or a person parking a motor
vehicle for a disabled person, who is charged with violating subdivision 1 because the person
parked in a parking space for physically disabled persons without the required certificate, license
plates, or permit must not be convicted if the person (1) produces in court or before the court
appearance the required certificate, permit, or evidence that the person has been issued plates under
section 168.021, (2) surrenders the expired permit or certificate, and (3) demonstrates entitlement
to the certificate, plates, or permit at the time of arrest or tagging. To be valid, the certificate or
permit must show that it is owned by the same person that owned the expired certificate or permit
displayed at the time the tag was issued. The registered vehicle owner is subject to the provisions
of this subdivision."
