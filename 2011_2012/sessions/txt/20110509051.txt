imposed by section 297A.62 and all local taxes and license fees except a fee authorized under section
349.16, subdivision 8, or a tax authorized under subdivision 5.
    The tax imposed under this subdivision is payable by the organization or party conducting,

   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 297E.02, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
     Subd. 4. Pull-tab and tipboard tax. (a) A tax is imposed on the sale of each deal of pull-tabs and

or tipboard deal. The sales tax imposed by chapter 297A on the sale of the pull-tabs and tipboards by
the distributor is imposed on the retail sales price less the tax imposed by this subdivision. The retail
sale of pull-tabs or tipboards by the organization is exempt from taxes imposed by chapter 297A
and is exempt from all local taxes and license fees except a fee authorized under section 349.16,
subdivision 8.
    (b) The liability for the tax imposed by this section is incurred when the pull-tabs and tipboards

the customer, or when received by the customer's authorized representative at the distributor's place
of business, regardless of the distributor's method of accounting or the terms of the sale.
    The tax imposed by this subdivision is imposed on all sales of pull-tabs and tipboards, except
the following:
   (1) sales to the governing body of an Indian tribal organization for use on an Indian reservation;
   (2) sales to distributors licensed under the laws of another state or of a province of Canada, as

    (4) pull-tabs and tipboards sold to an organization that sells pull-tabs and tipboards under
the exemption from licensing in section 349.166, subdivision 2. A distributor shall require an
organization conducting exempt gambling to show proof of its exempt status before making a
tax-exempt sale of pull-tabs or tipboards to the organization. A distributor shall identify, on all
reports submitted to the commissioner, all sales of pull-tabs and tipboards that are exempt from
tax under this subdivision.
   (c) A distributor having a liability of $10,000 or more during a fiscal year ending June 30 must
remit all liabilities in the subsequent calendar year by electronic means.
    (d) Any customer who purchases deals of pull-tabs or tipboards from a distributor may file an
annual claim for a refund or credit of taxes paid pursuant to this subdivision for unsold pull-tab
and tipboard tickets. The claim must be filed with the commissioner on a form prescribed by the
commissioner by March 20 of the year following the calendar year for which the refund is claimed.
The refund must be filed as part of the customer's February monthly return. The refund or credit is

    (a) All the powers and duties conferred and imposed upon the state auditor shall be exercised
and performed by the state auditor in respect to the offices, institutions, public property, and
improvements of several counties of the state. At least once in each year, if funds and personnel
permit, the state auditor may visit, without previous notice, each county and make a thorough
examination of all accounts and records relating to the receipt and disbursement of the public
funds and the custody of the public funds and other property. If the audit is performed by a private
certified public accountant, the state auditor may require additional information from the private
certified public accountant as the state auditor deems in the public interest. The state auditor may
accept the audit or make additional examinations as the state auditor deems to be in the public

shall be uniform, so far as practicable, for the same class of offices. A copy of the report of such
examination shall be filed and be subject to public inspection in the office of the state auditor
and another copy in the office of the auditor of the county thus examined. The state auditor may
accept the records and audit, or any part thereof, of the Department of Human Services in lieu of
examination of the county social welfare funds, if such audit has been made within any period
covered by the state auditor's audit of the other records of the county. If any such examination shall
disclose malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in any office of such county, such report shall
be filed with the county attorney of the county, and the county attorney shall institute such civil and
criminal proceedings as the law and the protection of the public interests shall require.
    (b) The county receiving any examination shall pay to the state general fund, notwithstanding
the provisions of section 16A.125, the total cost and expenses of such examinations, including the
salaries paid to the examiners while actually engaged in making such examination. The state auditor
on deeming it advisable may bill counties, having a population of 200,000 or over, monthly for
services rendered and the officials responsible for approving and paying claims shall cause said
bill to be promptly paid. The general fund shall be credited with all collections made for any such
examinations.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a county may provide for an audit to be performed by a
certified public accountant firm meeting the requirements of section 326A.05. The audit performed
under this paragraph must meet the standards and be in the form required by the state auditor. The
state auditor may require additional information from the certified public accountant firm as the
state auditor deems in the public interest, but the state auditor must accept the audit unless the state
auditor determines that it does not meet recognized industry auditing standards.

245A.07, or a license denial under section 245A.05, is based on a determination that an individual
subject to disqualification under chapter 245C is disqualified, the disqualification as a basis for the
licensing sanction or denial is public data. As specified in clause (1), if the disqualified individual
is the license holder or applicant, the identity of the license holder or applicant is public data. If the
disqualified individual is an individual other than the license holder or applicant, the identity of the

reveal the identity of individuals protected under subdivision 17. Photographs which are part of
inactive investigative files and which are clearly offensive to common sensibilities are classified as
private or nonpublic data, provided that the existence of the photographs shall be disclosed to any
person requesting access to the inactive investigative file. An investigation becomes inactive upon
the occurrence of any of the following events:
    (a) a decision by the agency or appropriate prosecutorial authority not to pursue the case;
   (b) expiration of the time to bring a charge or file a complaint under the applicable statute of
limitations, or 30 years after the commission of the offense, whichever comes earliest; or
   (c) exhaustion of or expiration of all rights of appeal by a person convicted on the basis of the
investigative data.
    Any investigative data presented as evidence in court shall be public. Data determined to be
inactive under clause (a) may become active if the agency or appropriate prosecutorial authority
decides to renew the investigation.
    During the time when an investigation is active, any person may bring an action in the
district court located in the county where the data ­s
                                                     i­ are being maintained to authorize disclosure
of investigative data. The court may order that all or part of the data relating to a particular
investigation be released to the public or to the person bringing the action. In making the
determination as to whether investigative data shall be disclosed, the court shall consider whether
the benefit to the person bringing the action or to the public outweighs any harm to the public, to
the agency or to any person identified in the data. The data in dispute shall be examined by the
court in camera.

subdivision 8 if the county attorney determines release would not impede the ongoing investigation.
When the law enforcement investigation becomes inactive, the data are private or nonpublic data.
Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to make not public the data elements identified in
