person, whether an independent contractor or other representative, who directly or indirectly
solicits business for the retailer.
    (b) A retailer is presumed to have a solicitor in this state if it enters into an agreement with
a resident under which the resident, for a commission or other consideration, directly or indirectly
refers potential customers, whether by a link on an Internet Web site, or otherwise, to the seller. This
paragraph only applies if the total gross receipts from sales to customers located in the state who
were referred to the retailer by all residents with this type of agreement with the retailer is at least
$10,000 in the 12-month period ending on the last day of the most recent calendar quarter before
the calendar quarter in which the sale is made.

the seller has an agreement did not engage in any solicitation in the state on behalf of the retailer that
would satisfy the nexus requirement of the United States Constitution during the 12-month period
in question. Nothing in this section shall be construed to narrow the scope of the terms affiliate,

estate which is residential and used for homestead purposes is class 1a. In the case of a duplex or

for the purposes of a homestead by:
   (1) any person who is blind as defined in section 256D.35, or the blind person and the blind
person's spouse;
   (2) any person who is permanently and totally disabled or by the disabled person and the disabled
person's spouse; or
    (3) the surviving spouse of a permanently and totally disabled veteran homesteading a property
classified under this paragraph for taxes payable in 2008.
    Property is classified and assessed under clause (2) only if the government agency or
income-providing source certifies, upon the request of the homestead occupant, that the homestead
occupant satisfies the disability requirements of this paragraph, and that the property is not eligible
for the valuation exclusion under subdivision 34.
    Property is classified and assessed under paragraph (b) only if the commissioner of revenue or
the county assessor certifies that the homestead occupant satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.
    Permanently and totally disabled for the purpose of this subdivision means a condition which
is permanent in nature and totally incapacitates the person from working at an occupation which
brings the person an income. The first $50,000 market value of class 1b property has a net class rate
of .45 percent of its market value. The remaining market value of class 1b property has a class rate
using the rates for class 1a or class 2a property, whichever is appropriate, of similar market value.
    (c) Class 1c property is commercial use real and personal property that abuts public water as
defined in section 103G.005, subdivision 15, and is devoted to temporary and seasonal residential
occupancy for recreational purposes but not devoted to commercial purposes for more than 250 days
in the year preceding the year of assessment, and that includes a portion used as a homestead by the
owner, which includes a dwelling occupied as a homestead by a shareholder of a corporation that
owns the resort, a partner in a partnership that owns the resort, or a member of a limited liability
company that owns the resort even if the title to the homestead is held by the corporation, partnership,
or limited liability company. For purposes of this paragraph, property is devoted to a commercial
purpose on a specific day if any portion of the property, excluding the portion used exclusively as a
homestead, is used for residential occupancy and a fee is charged for residential occupancy. Class 1c
property must contain three or more rental units. A "rental unit" is defined as a cabin, condominium,
townhouse, sleeping room, or individual camping site equipped with water and electrical hookups
for recreational vehicles. Class 1c property must provide recreational activities such as the rental
of ice fishing houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski equipment;
provide marina services, launch services, or guide services; or sell bait and fishing tackle. Any unit
in which the right to use the property is transferred to an individual or entity by deeded interest, or the
sale of shares or stock, no longer qualifies for class 1c even though it may remain available for rent.
A camping pad offered for rent by a property that otherwise qualifies for class 1c is also class 1c,
regardless of the term of the rental agreement, as long as the use of the camping pad does not exceed
250 days. If an owner of property that had been classified as class 1c ceases to use that property as a
homestead but retains ownership of that property and continues to operate it as a resort, and begins
to occupy a second property that is located in the same township as the original class 1c property,
both properties will be assessed as a single class 1c property, provided that the second property
would separately qualify to be assessed as class 1c property. The portion of the property used as a
homestead is class 1a property under paragraph (a). The remainder of the property is classified as

follows: the first $600,000 of market value is tier I, the next $1,700,000 of market value is tier II,
and any remaining market value is tier III. The class rates for class 1c are: tier I, 0.50 percent; tier II,
1.0 percent; and tier III, 1.25 percent. Owners of real and personal property devoted to temporary
and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes in which all or a portion of the property
was devoted to commercial purposes for not more than 250 days in the year preceding the year of
assessment desiring classification as class 1c, must submit a declaration to the assessor designating
the cabins or units occupied for 250 days or less in the year preceding the year of assessment by
January 15 of the assessment year. Those cabins or units and a proportionate share of the land on
which they are located must be designated as class 1c as otherwise provided. The remainder of the
cabins or units and a proportionate share of the land on which they are located must be designated as
class 3a commercial. The owner of property desiring designation as class 1c property must provide
guest registers or other records demonstrating that the units for which class 1c designation is sought
were not occupied for more than 250 days in the year preceding the assessment if so requested.
The portion of a property operated as a (1) restaurant, (2) bar, (3) gift shop, (4) conference center
or meeting room, and (5) other nonresidential facility operated on a commercial basis not directly
related to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes does not qualify for
class 1c.
      (d) Class 1d property includes structures that meet all of the following criteria:
   (1) the structure is located on property that is classified as agricultural property under section
273.13, subdivision 23;
   (2) the structure is occupied exclusively by seasonal farm workers during the time when they
work on that farm, and the occupants are not charged rent for the privilege of occupying the property,
provided that use of the structure for storage of farm equipment and produce does not disqualify the
property from classification under this paragraph;
      (3) the structure meets all applicable health and safety requirements for the appropriate season;
and
   (4) the structure is not salable as residential property because it does not comply with local
ordinances relating to location in relation to streets or roads.
   The market value of class 1d property has the same class rates as class 1a property under
paragraph (a).

    (d) In lieu of a tax computed according to the rates set forth in this subdivision, the tax of
any individual taxpayer whose taxable net income for the taxable year is less than an amount
determined by the commissioner must be computed in accordance with tables prepared and issued
by the commissioner of revenue based on income brackets of not more than $100. The amount of
tax for each bracket shall be computed at the rates set forth in this subdivision, provided that the
commissioner may disregard a fractional part of a dollar unless it amounts to 50 cents or more, in
which case it may be increased to $1.
    (e) An individual who is not a Minnesota resident for the entire year must compute the
individual's Minnesota income tax as provided in this subdivision. After the application of the
nonrefundable credits provided in this chapter, the tax liability must then be multiplied by a fraction
in which:
    (1) the numerator is the individual's Minnesota source federal adjusted gross income as defined
in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code and increased by the additions required under section
290.01, subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (12), (13), (16), and (17), and reduced
by the Minnesota assignable portion of the subtraction for United States government interest under
section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clause (1), and the subtractions under section 290.01, subdivision
19b, clauses (8), (9), (13), (14), (15), and (17), after applying the allocation and assignability
provisions of section 290.081, clause (a), or 290.17; and
   (2) the denominator is the individual's federal adjusted gross income as defined in section
62 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, increased by the amounts specified in section 290.01,
subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (12), (13), (16), and (17), and reduced by the
amounts specified in section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clauses (1), (8), (9), (13), (14), (15), and (17).

any rate bracket must not be changed. The dollar amounts setting forth the tax shall be adjusted to
reflect the changes in the rate brackets. The rate brackets as adjusted must be rounded to the nearest
$10 amount. If the rate bracket ends in $5, it must be rounded up to the nearest $10 amount.
    (b) The commissioner shall adjust the rate brackets and by the percentage determined pursuant
to the provisions of section 1(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, except that in section 1(f)(3)(B) the

   "Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290.17, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Unitary business principle. (a) If a trade or business conducted wholly within this
state or partly within and partly without this state is part of a unitary business, the entire income
of the unitary business is subject to apportionment pursuant to section 290.191. Notwithstanding
subdivision 2, paragraph (c), none of the income of a unitary business is considered to be derived
from any particular source and none may be allocated to a particular place except as provided by
the applicable apportionment formula. The provisions of this subdivision do not apply to business
income subject to subdivision 5, income of an insurance company, or income of an investment
company determined under section 290.36.
   (b) The term "unitary business" means business activities or operations which result in a flow of
value between them. The term may be applied within a single legal entity or between multiple entities

and without regard to whether each entity is a sole proprietorship, a corporation, a partnership or a
trust.
    (c) Unity is presumed whenever there is unity of ownership, operation, and use, evidenced by
centralized management or executive force, centralized purchasing, advertising, accounting, or other
controlled interaction, but the absence of these centralized activities will not necessarily evidence
a nonunitary business. Unity is also presumed when business activities or operations are of mutual
benefit, dependent upon or contributory to one another, either individually or as a group.
    (d) Where a business operation conducted in Minnesota is owned by a business entity that carries
on business activity outside the state different in kind from that conducted within this state, and the
other business is conducted entirely outside the state, it is presumed that the two business operations
are unitary in nature, interrelated, connected, and interdependent unless it can be shown to the
contrary.
    (e) Unity of ownership is not deemed to exist when a corporation is involved unless that
corporation is a member of a group of two or more business entities and more than 50 percent
of the voting stock of each member of the group is directly or indirectly owned by a common
owner or by common owners, either corporate or noncorporate, or by one or more of the member
corporations of the group. For this purpose, the term "voting stock" shall include membership
interests of mutual insurance holding companies formed under section 66A.40.
     (f) The net income and apportionment factors under section 290.191 or 290.20 of foreign
corporations and other foreign entities which are part of a unitary business shall not be included
in the net income or the apportionment factors of the unitary business. A foreign corporation or
other foreign entity which is required to file a return under this chapter shall file on a separate
return basis. T   ­h

    (d) In lieu of a tax computed according to the rates set forth in this subdivision, the tax of
any individual taxpayer whose taxable net income for the taxable year is less than an amount
determined by the commissioner must be computed in accordance with tables prepared and issued
by the commissioner of revenue based on income brackets of not more than $100. The amount of
tax for each bracket shall be computed at the rates set forth in this subdivision, provided that the
commissioner may disregard a fractional part of a dollar unless it amounts to 50 cents or more, in
which case it may be increased to $1.
    (e) An individual who is not a Minnesota resident for the entire year must compute the
individual's Minnesota income tax as provided in this subdivision. After the application of the
nonrefundable credits provided in this chapter, the tax liability must then be multiplied by a fraction
in which:
    (1) the numerator is the individual's Minnesota source federal adjusted gross income as defined
in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code and increased by the additions required under section
290.01, subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (12), (13), (16), and (17), and reduced
by the Minnesota assignable portion of the subtraction for United States government interest under

any rate bracket must not be changed. The dollar amounts setting forth the tax shall be adjusted to
