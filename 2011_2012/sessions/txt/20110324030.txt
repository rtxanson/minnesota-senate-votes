exemption certificate that is in effect before March 1, 2009, shall remain in effect until March 1,
2013, unless revoked by the commissioner or canceled by the individual.
    (c) Within 30 days of receiving a complete application and the certificate fee, the commissioner
must either grant or deny the application. The commissioner may deny an application for an
independent contractor exemption certificate if the individual has not submitted a complete
application and certificate fee or if the individual does not meet all of the conditions for holding
the independent contractor exemption certificate. The commissioner may revoke an independent
contractor exemption certificate if the commissioner determines that the individual no longer meets
all of the conditions for holding the independent contractor exemption certificate, commits any of
the actions set out in subdivision 7, or fails to cooperate with a department investigation into the
continued validity of the individual's certificate. Once issued, an independent contractor exemption
certificate remains in effect for four years unless:
     (1) revoked by the commissioner; or
     (2) canceled by the individual.
   (d) If the department denies an individual's original or renewal application for an independent
contractor exemption certificate or revokes an independent contractor exemption certificate, the
commissioner shall issue to the individual an order denying or revoking the certificate. The
commissioner may issue an administrative penalty order to an individual or person who commits
any of the actions set out in subdivision 7. The commissioner may file and enforce the unpaid
portion of a penalty as a judgment in district court without further notice or additional proceedings.
    (e) An individual or person to whom the commissioner issues an order under paragraph (d) shall
have 30 days after service of the order to request a hearing. The request for hearing must be in
writing and must be served on or faxed to the commissioner at the address or facsimile number
specified in the order by the 30th day after service of the order. If the individual does not request
a hearing or if the individual's request for a hearing is not served on or faxed to the commissioner
by the 30th day after service of the order, the order shall become a final order of the commissioner
and will not be subject to review by any court or agency. The date on which a request for hearing is
served by mail shall be the postmark date on the envelope in which the request for hearing is mailed.
If the individual serves or faxes a timely request for hearing, the hearing shall be a contested case
hearing and shall be held in accordance with chapter 14.

shall serve on the commissioner a verified application for compensation on a form approved by the
commissioner. The application shall verify the following information:
   (1) the specific grounds upon which the owner or lessee seeks to recover from the fund:
   (2) that the owner or the lessee has obtained a final judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction
against a licensee licensed under section 326B.83;
    (3) that the final judgment was obtained against the licensee on the grounds of fraudulent,
deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure of performance that arose directly
out of a contract directly between the licensee and the homeowner or lessee that was entered into
prior to the cause of action and that occurred when the licensee was licensed and performing any
of the special skills enumerated under section 326B.802, subdivision 15;
    (4) the amount of the owner's or the lessee's actual and direct out-of-pocket loss on the owner's
residential real estate, on residential real estate leased by the lessee, or on new residential real estate
that has never been occupied or that was occupied by the licensee for less than one year prior to
purchase by the owner;
   (5) that the residential real estate is located in Minnesota;
    (6) that the owner or the lessee is not the spouse of the licensee or the personal representative
of the licensee;
    (7) the amount of the final judgment, any amount paid in satisfaction of the final judgment, and
the amount owing on the final judgment as of the date of the verified application;
    (8) that the owner or lessee has diligently pursued remedies against all the judgment debtors and
all other persons liable to the judgment debtor in the contract for which the owner or lessee seeks
recovery from the fund; and
   (9) that the verified application is being served within two years after the judgment became final.
   The verified application must include documents evidencing the amount of the owner's or

the lessee's actual and direct out-of-pocket loss. The owner's and the lessee's actual and direct
out-of-pocket loss shall not include any attorney fees, litigation costs or fees, interest on the loss,
and interest on the final judgment obtained as a result of the loss or any costs not directly related
to the value difference between what was contracted for and what was provided. Any amount paid
in satisfaction of the final judgment shall be applied to the owner's or lessee's actual and direct
out-of-pocket loss. An owner or lessee may serve a verified application regardless of whether
the final judgment has been discharged by a bankruptcy court. A judgment issued by a court is
final if all proceedings on the judgment have either been pursued and concluded or been forgone,
including all reviews and appeals. For purposes of this section, owners who are joint tenants or
tenants in common are deemed to be a single owner. For purposes of this section, owners and
lessees eligible for payment of compensation from the fund shall not include government agencies,
political subdivisions, financial institutions, and any other entity that purchases, guarantees, or
insures a loan secured by real estate.
   Sec. 49. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 326B.89, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
    Subd. 8. Administrative hearing. If an owner or a lessee timely serves a request for hearing
under subdivision 7, the commissioner shall request that an administrative law judge be assigned
and that a hearing be conducted under the contested case provisions of chapter 14 within 45 days
after the commissioner received the request for hearing, unless the parties agree to a later date. The
commissioner must notify the owner or lessee of the time and place of the hearing at least 15 days
before the hearing. Upon petition of the commissioner, the administrative law judge shall continue
the hearing up to 60 days and upon a showing of good cause may continue the hearing for such
additional period as the administrative law judge deems appropriate.
    At the hearing the owner or the lessee shall have the burden of proving by substantial evidence
under subdivision 6, clauses (1) to (8). Whenever an applicant's judgment is by default, stipulation,
or consent, or whenever the action against the licensee was defended by a trustee in bankruptcy, the
applicant shall have the burden of proving the cause of action for fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest
practices, conversion of funds, or failure of performance. Otherwise, the judgment shall create a
rebuttable presumption of the fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or
failure of performance. This presumption affects the burden of producing evidence.
     The administrative law judge shall issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order. If the
administrative law judge finds that compensation should be paid to the owner or the lessee, the
administrative law judge shall order the commissioner to make payment from the fund of the amount
it finds to be payable pursuant to the provisions of and in accordance with the limitations contained
in this section. The order of the administrative law judge shall constitute the final decision of the
agency in the contested case. The commissioner or the owner or lessee may seek judicial review of
                                                                               sh

    Sec. 54. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 327.33, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Fees. The commissioner shall by rule establish reasonable fees for seals, installation
seals and inspections which are sufficient to cover all costs incurred in the administration of
sections 327.31 to 327.35. The commissioner shall also establish by rule a monitoring inspection
fee in an amount that will comply with the secretary's fee distribution program. This monitoring
inspection fee shall be an amount paid by the manufacturer for each manufactured home produced
in Minnesota. The monitoring inspection fee shall be paid by the manufacturer to the secretary.
The rules of the fee distribution program require the secretary to distribute the fees collected from
all manufactured home manufacturers among states approved and conditionally approved based
on the number of new manufactured homes whose first location after leaving the manufacturer is
on the premises of a distributor, dealer or purchaser in that state. Fees for inspections in areas that
have not adopted the State Building Code must be equal to the fees for inspections in code areas of
the state. Third-party vendors may charge their usual and normal charge for inspections.
