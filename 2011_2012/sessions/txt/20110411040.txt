that apply to a retail liquor license shall apply to a license issued under this subdivision unless the
provision is explicitly inconsistent with this subdivision.
  (b) A brewer may only have one taproom license under this subdivision, and may not have an
ownership interest in a brewery licensed under subdivision 6, clause (d).
    (c) A municipality may not issue a brewer taproom license to a brewer if the brewer seeking the
license, or any person having an economic interest in the brewer seeking the license or exercising
control over the brewer seeking the license, is a brewer that brews more than 250,000 barrels of
malt liquor annually or a winery that produces more than 250,000 gallons of wine annually.
   (d) The municipality shall impose a licensing fee on a brewer holding a brewer taproom license
under this subdivision, subject to limitations applicable to license fees under section 340A.408,
subdivision 2, paragraph (a).
    (e) A municipality shall, within ten days of the issuance of a license under this subdivision,
inform the commissioner of the licensee's name and address and trade name, and the effective date
and expiration date of the license. The municipality shall also inform the commissioner of a license
transfer, cancellation, suspension, or revocation during the license period.
