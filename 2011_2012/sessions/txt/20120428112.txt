      Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 124D.095, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Online learning parameters. (a) An online learning student must receive academic
credit for completing the requirements of an online learning course or program. Secondary credits
granted to an online learning student count toward the graduation and credit requirements of the
enrolling district. The enrolling district must apply the same graduation requirements to all students,
including online learning students, and must continue to provide nonacademic services to online
learning students. If a student completes an online learning course or program that meets or exceeds
a graduation standard or the grade progression requirement at the enrolling district, that standard or
requirement is met. The enrolling district must use the same criteria for accepting online learning
credits or courses as it does for accepting credits or courses for transfer students under section
124D.03, subdivision 9. The enrolling district may reduce the course schedule of an online learning
student in proportion to the number of online learning courses the student takes from an online
learning provider that is not the enrolling district.
      (b) An online learning student may:
    (1) enroll in supplemental online learning courses equal to a maximum of 50 percent of the
student's full schedule of courses per term during a single school year and the student may exceed the
supplemental online learning registration limit if the enrolling district permits supplemental online
learning enrollment above the limit, or if the enrolling district and the online learning provider agree
to the instructional services;
      (2) complete course work at a grade level that is different from the student's current grade level;
and
      (3) enroll in additional courses with the online learning provider under a separate agreement that

includes terms for paying any tuition or course fees.
    (c) An online learning student has the same access to the computer hardware and education
software available in a school as all other students in the enrolling district. An online learning
provider must assist an online learning student whose family qualifies for the education tax credit
under section 290.0674 to acquire computer hardware and educational software for online learning
purposes.

              e digital learning only to its enrolled students is not subject to the reporting requirements
or review criteria under subdivision 7, unless the enrolling district is a full-time online learning
provider. A teacher with a Minnesota license must assemble and deliver instruction to enrolled
students receiving online learning from an enrolling district. The delivery of instruction occurs
when the student interacts with the computer or the teacher and receives ongoing assistance and
assessment of learning. The instruction may include curriculum developed by persons other than a
teacher holding a Minnesota license.
    (e) Both full-time and supplemental online learning providers are subject to the reporting
requirements and review criteria under subdivision 7. A teacher holding a Minnesota license must
assemble and deliver instruction to online learning students. The delivery of instruction occurs
when the student interacts with the computer or the teacher and receives ongoing assistance and
assessment of learning. The instruction may include curriculum developed by persons other than a
teacher holding a Minnesota license. Unless the commissioner grants a waiver, a teacher providing
online learning instruction must not instruct more than 40 students in any one online learning
course or program.
    (f) To enroll in more than 50 percent of the student's full schedule of courses per term in online
learning, the student must qualify to exceed the supplemental online learning registration limit under
paragraph (b) or apply to enroll in an approved full-time online learning program, consistent with
subdivision 3, paragraph (a). Full-time online learning students may enroll in classes at a local
school under a contract for instructional services between the online learning provider and the school
district.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 124D.095, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Department of Education. (a) The department must review and approve or
disapprove online learning providers within 90 calendar days of receiving an online learning
provider's completed application. The commissioner, using research-based standards of quality
for online learning programs, must review all approved online learning providers on a cyclical
three-year basis. Approved online learning providers annually must submit program data to,
confirm statements of assurances for, and provide program updates including a current course list
to the commissioner.
    (b) The online learning courses and programs must be rigorous, aligned with state academic
standards, and contribute to grade progression in a single subject. The online learning provider,
other than a digital learning provider offering digital learning to its enrolled students only under
subdivision 4, paragraph (d), must give the commissioner written assurance that: (1) all courses
6632                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [112TH DAY

expectations for actual teacher-contact time or other student-to-teacher communication, and
academic support meet nationally recognized professional standards and are described as such in
an online learning course syllabus that meets the commissioner's requirements. Once an online
learning provider is approved under this paragraph, all of its online learning course offerings are
eligible for payment under this section unless a course is successfully challenged by an enrolling
district or the department under paragraph ­

The Honorable Kurt Zellers
Speaker of the House of Representatives
The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
    We, the undersigned conferees for H. F. No. 2164 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
    That the Senate recede from its amendments and that H. F. No. 2164 be further amended as
follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. [15.985] ADVISORY INSPECTIONS.
    (a) Upon the voluntary request of a person to a state agency for an advisory inspection for the
purpose of complying with state law, the agency must, except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g),
conduct an advisory inspection. An agency is not required to conduct an advisory inspection if the
agency has a regularly scheduled inspection that would occur within 90 days after the request for
the advisory inspection, or if before an advisory inspection is requested, the agency has notified the
person that it will be conducting an inspection within 45 days. If an advisory inspection results in
findings that potentially could make a person subject to a fine or other penalty imposed by the agency,
the agency must notify the person in writing of those findings within ten days of the inspection.
    (1) Except as provided in clause (2), if within 60 days of receiving notice, the person notifies
the agency that it has corrected the situation that made the person potentially subject to the fine or
penalty, and the agency later determines that the situation is corrected, the agency may not impose
a fine or penalty as a result of the findings in the advisory inspection.
    (2) For violations of chapter 177, if the person notifies the agency within the time period for
remedying violations required under the applicable section of chapter 177 that it has corrected
the situation that made the person potentially subject to the fine or penalty, and the agency later
determines that the situation is corrected, the agency may not impose a fine or penalty as a result of
the finding in the advisory inspection.
    (3) A person may not request more than one advisory inspection from the same agency in a
calendar year. A person may not request an advisory inspection after an inspection resulting in a
fine or other penalty has been determined and the violator notified of the amount to be paid, until
fines or penalties have been paid or settled.
   (b) For purposes of this section:
   (1) "inspection" includes an examination of real or personal property or an audit or other
examination of financial or other documents;
6638                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [112TH DAY

   (2) "penalty" includes a civil or administrative fine or other financial sanction;
    (3) "person" includes a real person and businesses, including corporations, partnerships, limited
liability companies, and unincorporated associations; and
   (4) "state agency" means a department, agency, board, commission, constitutional office, or other
group in the executive branch of state government.
    (c) If an agency revises, amends, extends, or adds additional violations to a notice, the person has
60 days from the date of those changes to correct the situation without fine or penalty. For violations
of chapter 177, the person has the time period for remedying violations under the applicable section
of chapter 177 to correct the situation without fine or penalty.
    (d) An agency conducting an inspection under this section may impose and collect from the
person requesting the inspection a fee equal to the costs incurred by the agency related to the
inspection. Fees under this section shall be considered charges for goods and services provided
for the direct and primary use of a private individual, business, or other entity under section
16A.1283, paragraph (b), clause (3). Fee revenue collected under this section must be deposited in
an appropriate fund other than the general fund and is appropriated from that fund to the agency
collecting the fee for the purpose of conducting inspections under this section.
    (e) Nothing in this section shall prohibit or interfere with an agency offering similar programs
that allow independent audits or inspections, including the environmental improvement program
under chapter 114C. If a person conducts a self-audit under chapter 114C, the terms and conditions
of this section do not apply. For advisory inspections conducted by the Pollution Control Agency,
terms and conditions of sections 114C.20 to 144C.28 shall be used instead of those in paragraphs
(a) to (c) and (g).
     (f) If agency staff resources are limited, an agency must give higher priority to the agency's
regular inspections over advisory inspections under this section. Insofar as conducting advisory
inspections reduces an agency's costs, the savings must be reflected in the charges for advisory
inspections. Before hiring additional staff complement for purposes of this section, an agency
must report to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative budget committees
with jurisdiction over the agency documenting: (1) the demand for advisory inspections and why
additional staff complement is needed to meet the demand; and (2) that the revenue generated
by advisory inspections will cover the expenses of the additional staff complement. If a person
requests an advisory inspection, but the agency does not have staff resources necessary to conduct
the advisory inspection before a regular inspection is conducted, and the regular inspection results
in findings that could make a person subject to a fine or penalty, the agency must take into account
the person's request for an advisory inspection and the person's desire to take corrective action
before taking any enforcement action against the person.
   (g) This section does not apply to:
   (1) criminal penalties;
    (2) situations in which implementation of this section is prohibited by federal law or would
result in loss of federal funding or in other federal sanctions or in which implementation would
interfere with multistate agreements, international agreements, or agreements between state and
federal regulatory agencies;

   (3) conduct constituting fraud;
    (4) violations in a manner that endangers human life or presents significant risk of major injury
or severe emotional harm to humans;
   (5) violations that are part of a pattern that has occurred repeatedly and shows willful intent;
   (6) violations for which it may be demonstrated that the alternative inspections process is being
used to avoid enforcement;
   (7) violations that occur within three years of violating an applicable law;
   (8) the Department of Revenue;
   (9) the Workers' Compensation Division at the Department of Labor and Industry;
   (10) violations of vehicle size weight limits under sections 169.80 to 169.88;
   (11) commercial motor vehicle inspections under section 169.781 and motor carrier regulations
under chapter 221;
   (12) the Dairy and Food Inspection Division of the Department of Agriculture, if the division
provides free inspections similar to those under this section;
    (13) state inspections or surveys of hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient surgical centers,
supervised living facilities, board and lodging with special services, home care, housing with
services and assisted living settings, hospice, and supplemental nursing services agencies;
   (14) examinations of health maintenance organizations or county-based purchasing entities
regulated under chapter 62D;
   (15) special transportation services under section 174.30; and
   (16) entities regulated by the Department of Commerce's Financial Institutions and Insurance
Divisions for purposes of regulatory requirements of those divisions.
If an agency determines that this section does not apply due to situations specified in clause (2), the
agency must report the basis for that determination to the chairs and ranking minority members of
the legislative committees with jurisdiction over the agency.
    (h) An agency may terminate an advisory inspection and proceed as if an inspection were
a regular inspection if, in the process of conducting an advisory inspection, the agency finds a
situation that the agency determines: could lead to criminal penalties; endangers human life or
presents significant risk of major injury or severe emotional harm to humans; presents a severe and
imminent threat to animals, food, feed, crops, commodities, or the environment; or evidences a
pattern of willful violations.

macrophytes, or water is present on the watercraft or water-related equipment.
    (d) Conservation officers or other licensed peace officers may utilize check stations in locations,
or in proximity to locations, where watercraft or other water-related equipment is placed into or
removed from waters of the state. Any check stations shall be operated in a manner that minimizes
delays to vehicles, equipment, and their occupants.
    (e) Conservation officers or other licensed peace officers may order water-related equipment to
be removed from a water body if the commissioner determines such action is needed to implement

    Subd. 14. Local water management coordination. (a) The board may adopt resolutions,
policies, or orders that allow a comprehensive plan, local water management plan, or watershed
management plan, developed or amended, approved and adopted, according to chapter 103B,
103C, or 103D to serve as substitutes for one another or be replaced with a comprehensive
watershed management plan. The board may also develop criteria for incorporating or coordinating
the elements of metropolitan county groundwater plans in accordance with section 103B.255.
The board shall, to the extent practicable, incorporate a watershed approach when adopting the
resolutions, policies, or orders, and shall establish a suggested watershed boundary framework for
development, approval, adoption, and coordination of plans.
    (b) The board shall work with local government stakeholders and others to foster mutual
understanding and develop recommendations for local water management and related state water
management policy and programs. The board may convene informal working groups or work teams
to develop information, education, and recommendations. Local government units may develop

    Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103B.101, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 15. Local water management boundary and plan determinations and appeals. (a)
Local government units may either submit a request for a plan boundary determination as part
of a plan approval request or apply separately for a plan boundary determination from the board
before requesting plan approval. Local government units must provide written documentation of the
rationale and justification for the proposed boundary. The board may request additional information
needed to make a plan boundary determination.
    (b) Local government units may appeal a board decision to deny approval of a plan or the
establishment of a plan boundary. An appeal of a board decision may be taken to the state Court of
Appeals and must be considered an appeal from a contested case decision for purposes of judicial
review under sections 14.63 to 14.69. Local government units may request the board's dispute
resolution committee or executive director to hear and make recommendations to resolve boundary
and plan implementation disputes.
    Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103B.311, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Water plan requirements. (a) A local water management plan must:
    (1) cover the entire area within a county;
    (2) address water problems in the context of watershed units and groundwater systems;
   (3) be based upon principles of sound hydrologic management of water, effective environmental
protection, and efficient management;
    (4) be consistent with local water management plans prepared by counties and watershed
management organizations wholly or partially within a single watershed unit or groundwater
system; and
     (5) the local water management plan must specify the period covered by the local water
management plan and must extend at least five years but no more than ten years from the date
the board approves the local water management plan. Local water management plans that contain
revision dates inconsistent with this section must comply with that date, provided it is not more
than ten years beyond the date of board approval. A           ­ ­w

Public entities are encouraged to allow for the removal of logs and dead trees and branches that
present a safety hazard on land managed by the public entity.
   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103F.321, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 4. Removal of logs; dead trees and branches. The removal of logs and dead trees and
branches from the shoreland is exempt from any permit requirements when the logs or dead trees
and branches present safety hazards, unless required by a local government unit. Before a person
removes logs or dead trees and branches from publicly owned land or land owned by another, the

person must obtain permission from the land owner or manager. Public entities are encouraged to
allow for the removal of logs and dead trees and branches that present a safety hazard on land
managed by the public entity.
   Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 103G.222, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Requirements. (a) Wetlands must not be drained or filled, wholly or partially,
unless replaced by restoring or creating wetland areas of at least equal public value under
a replacement plan approved as provided in section 103G.2242, a replacement plan under a
local governmental unit's comprehensive wetland protection and management plan approved by
the board under section 103G.2243, or, if a permit to mine is required under section 93.481,
under a mining reclamation plan approved by the commissioner under the permit to mine. For
project-specific wetland replacement completed prior to wetland impacts authorized or conducted
under a permit to mine within the Great Lakes and Rainy River watershed basins, those basins
shall be considered a single watershed for purposes of determining wetland replacement ratios.
Mining reclamation plans shall apply the same principles and standards for replacing wetlands by
restoration or creation of wetland areas that are applicable to mitigation plans approved as provided
in section 103G.2242. Public value must be determined in accordance with section 103B.3355 or
a comprehensive wetland protection and management plan established under section 103G.2243.
Sections 103G.221 to 103G.2372 also apply to excavation in permanently and semipermanently
flooded areas of types 3, 4, and 5 wetlands.
    (b) Replacement must be guided by the following principles in descending order of priority:
    (1) avoiding the direct or indirect impact of the activity that may destroy or diminish the wetland;
   (2) minimizing the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the wetland activity and its
implementation;
   (3) rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected wetland
environment;
   (4) reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations
during the life of the activity;
    (5) compensating for the impact by restoring a wetland; and
   (6) compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute wetland resources or
environments.
    For a project involving the draining or filling of wetlands in an amount not exceeding 10,000
square feet more than the applicable amount in section 103G.2241, subdivision 9, paragraph (a), the
local government unit may make an on-site sequencing determination without a written alternatives
analysis from the applicant.
     (c) If a wetland is located in a cultivated field, then replacement must be accomplished through
restoration only without regard to the priority order in paragraph (b), provided that ­   ad

wetland area drained is at risk of conversion to a nonagricultural use within ten years based on the
zoning classification, proximity to a municipality or full service road, or other criteria as determined
by the local government unit.
   (e) Restoration and replacement of wetlands must be accomplished in accordance with the
ecology of the landscape area affected and ponds that are created primarily to fulfill storm water
management, and water quality treatment requirements may not be used to satisfy replacement
requirements under this chapter unless the design includes pretreatment of runoff and the pond is
functioning as a wetland.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraph (g), for a wetland or public waters wetland located on
nonagricultural land, replacement must be in the ratio of two acres of replaced wetland for each
acre of drained or filled wetland.
    (g) For a wetland or public waters wetland located on agricultural land or in a greater than 80
percent area, replacement must be in the ratio of one acre of replaced wetland for each acre of
drained or filled wetland.
    (h) Wetlands that are restored or created as a result of an approved replacement plan are subject
to the provisions of this section for any subsequent drainage or filling.
    (i) Except in a greater than 80 percent area, only wetlands that have been restored from
previously drained or filled wetlands, wetlands created by excavation in nonwetlands, wetlands
created by dikes or dams along public or private drainage ditches, or wetlands created by dikes
or dams associated with the restoration of previously drained or filled wetlands may be used in a
statewide banking program established in rules adopted under section 103G.2242, subdivision 1.
Modification or conversion of nondegraded naturally occurring wetlands from one type to another
are not eligible for enrollment in a statewide wetlands bank.
    (j) The Technical Evaluation Panel established under section 103G.2242, subdivision 2,
shall ensure that sufficient time has occurred for the wetland to develop wetland characteristics
of soils, vegetation, and hydrology before recommending that the wetland be deposited in the
statewide wetland bank. If the Technical Evaluation Panel has reason to believe that the wetland
characteristics may change substantially, the panel shall postpone its recommendation until the
wetland has stabilized.
    (k) This section and sections 103G.223 to 103G.2242, 103G.2364, and 103G.2365 apply to the
state and its departments and agencies.
    (l) For projects involving draining or filling of wetlands associated with a new public
transportation project, and for projects expanded solely for additional traffic capacity, public
transportation authorities may purchase credits from the board at the cost to the board to establish
credits. Proceeds from the sale of credits provided under this paragraph are appropriated to the
board for the purposes of this paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, "transportation
project" does not include an airport project.
112TH DAY]                         SATURDAY, APRIL 28, 2012                                       6659

     (m) A replacement plan for wetlands is not required for individual projects that result in the
filling or draining of wetlands for the repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or replacement of a
currently serviceable existing state, city, county, or town public road necessary, as determined by the
public transportation authority, to meet state or federal design or safety standards or requirements,
excluding new roads or roads expanded solely for additional traffic capacity lanes. This paragraph
only applies to authorities for public transportation projects that:
   (1) minimize the amount of wetland filling or draining associated with the project and consider
mitigating important site-specific wetland functions on site;
    (2) except as provided in clause (3), submit project-specific reports to the board, the Technical
Evaluation Panel, the commissioner of natural resources, and members of the public requesting a
copy at least 30 days prior to construction that indicate the location, amount, and type of wetlands to
be filled or drained by the project or, alternatively, convene an annual meeting of the parties required
to receive notice to review projects to be commenced during the upcoming year; and
    (3) for minor and emergency maintenance work impacting less than 10,000 square feet, submit
project-specific reports, within 30 days of commencing the activity, to the board that indicate the
location, amount, and type of wetlands that have been filled or drained.
    Those required to receive notice of public transportation projects may appeal minimization,
delineation, and on-site mitigation decisions made by the public transportation authority to the board
according to the provisions of section 103G.2242, subdivision 9. The Technical Evaluation Panel
shall review minimization and delineation decisions made by the public transportation authority and
provide recommendations regarding on-site mitigation if requested to do so by the local government
unit, a contiguous landowner, or a member of the Technical Evaluation Panel.
     Except for state public transportation projects, for which the state Department of Transportation
is responsible, the board must replace the wetlands, and wetland areas of public waters if authorized
by the commissioner or a delegated authority, drained or filled by public transportation projects on
existing roads.
    Public transportation authorities at their discretion may deviate from federal and state design
standards on existing road projects when practical and reasonable to avoid wetland filling or
draining, provided that public safety is not unreasonably compromised. The local road authority
and its officers and employees are exempt from liability for any tort claim for injury to persons or
property arising from travel on the highway and related to the deviation from the design standards
for construction or reconstruction under this paragraph. This paragraph does not preclude an action
for damages arising from negligence in construction or maintenance on a highway.
    (n) If a landowner seeks approval of a replacement plan after the proposed project has already
affected the wetland, the local government unit may require the landowner to replace the affected
wetland at a ratio not to exceed twice the replacement ratio otherwise required.
   (o) A local government unit may request the board to reclassify a county or watershed on
the basis of its percentage of presettlement wetlands remaining. After receipt of satisfactory
documentation from the local government, the board shall change the classification of a county
or watershed. If requested by the local government unit, the board must assist in developing the
documentation. Within 30 days of its action to approve a change of wetland classifications, the
board shall publish a notice of the change in the Environmental Quality Board Monitor.

   (p) One hundred citizens who reside within the jurisdiction of the local government unit may
request the local government unit to reclassify a county or watershed on the basis of its percentage of
presettlement wetlands remaining. In support of their petition, the citizens shall provide satisfactory
documentation to the local government unit. The local government unit shall consider the petition
and forward the request to the board under paragraph (o) or provide a reason why the petition is
denied.
     Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103G.2241, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
     Subdivision 1. Agricultural activities. A replacement plan for wetlands is not required for:
    (1) activities in a wetland that was planted with annually seeded crops, was in a crop rotation
seeding of pasture grass or legumes, or was required to be set aside to receive price support or other
payments under United States Code, title 7, sections 1421 to 1469, in six of the last ten years prior
to January 1, 1991;
    (2) activities in a type 1 wetland on agricultural pasture land that remains in the same use, except
for bottomland hardwood type 1 wetlands, and activities in a type 2 or type 6 wetland that is less
than two acres in size and located on agricultural pasture land that remains in the same use;
    (3) activities in a wetland conducted as part of normal farming practices. For purposes of this
clause, "normal farming practices" means farming, silvicultural, grazing, and ranching activities
such as plowing, seeding, cultivating, and harvesting for the production of feed, food, and fiber
products, but does not include activities that result in the draining of wetlands;
    (4) soil and water conservation practices approved by the soil and water conservation district,
after review by the Technical Evaluation Panel;
    (5) aquaculture activities including pond excavation and construction and maintenance of
associated access roads and dikes authorized under, and conducted in accordance with, a permit
issued by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the federal Clean Water
Act, United States Code, title 33, section 1344, but not including construction or expansion of
buildings;
   (6) wild rice production activities, including necessary diking and other activities authorized
under a permit issued by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the federal
Clean Water Act, United States Code, title 33, section 1344; or
    (7) agricultural activities on agricultural land that is subject to the swampbuster provisions of the
federal farm program restrictions ­h       t­­

    (c) Except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), (g), (h), and (i), a replacement plan for wetlands
is not required for draining or filling up to 20 square feet of wetland as part of a project within
the shoreland building setback zone, as defined in the local shoreland management ordinance. The
amount in this paragraph may be increased to 100 square feet if permanent water runoff retention
or infiltration measures are established in proximity as approved by the shoreland management
authority.

   Sec. 48. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103G.261, is amended to read:
   103G.261 WATER ALLOCATION PRIORITIES.
    (a) The commissioner shall adopt rules for allocation of waters based on the following priorities
for the consumptive appropriation and use of water:
    (1) first priority, domestic water supply, excluding industrial and commercial uses of municipal
water supply, and use for power production that meets the contingency planning provisions of
section 103G.285, subdivision 6;
    (2) second priority, a use of water that involves consumption of less than 10,000 gallons of water
per day;
   (3) third priority, agricultural irrigation, and processing of agricultural products involving
consumption in excess of 10,000 gallons per day;
   (4) fourth priority, power production in excess of the use provided for in the contingency plan
developed under section 103G.285, subdivision 6;
   (5) fifth priority, uses, other than agricultural irrigation, processing of agricultural products, and
power production, involving consumption in excess of 10,000 gallons per day; and
   (6) sixth priority, nonessential uses.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, "consumption" means water withdrawn from a supply that
is lost for immediate further use in the area.
   (c) Appropriation and use of surface water from streams during periods of flood flows and high
water levels must be encouraged subject to consideration of the purposes for use, quantities to be
used, and the number of persons appropriating water.
   (d) Appropriation and use of surface water from lakes of less than 500 acres in surface area must
be discouraged.
   (e) The treatment and reuse of water for nonconsumptive uses shall be encouraged.

It is the purpose of sections 115.41 to 115.53 to safeguard the waters of the state from pollution by:
(a) preventing any new pollution; and (b) abating pollution existing when sections 115.41 to 115.53
become effective, under a program consistent with the declaration of policy above stated.
    Sec. 62. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 115.55, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Local standards. (a) Existing systems. Counties may adopt by ordinance local
standards that are less restrictive than the agency's rules in order to define an acceptable existing
system. The local standards may include soil separation, soil classification, vegetation, system use,
localized well placement and construction, localized density of systems and wells, extent of area to
be covered by local standards, groundwater flow patterns, and existing natural or artificial drainage
systems. The local standards and criteria shall be submitted to the commissioner for comment prior
to adoption to demonstrate that, based on local circumstances in that jurisdiction, they adequately
protect public health and the environment.
     (b) New or replacement systems. Counties, after providing documentation of conditions
listed in this paragraph to the commissioner, may adopt by ordinance local standards that are
less restrictive than the agency's rules for new system construction or replacement in areas of
sustained and projected low population density where conditions render conformance to applicable
requirements difficult or otherwise inappropriate. Documentation may include a map delineating
the area of the county to be served by the local standards, a description of the hardship that
would result from strict adherence to the agency's rules, and evidence of sustained and projected
6668                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [112TH DAY

low population density. The local standards must protect human health and the environment and
be based on considerations that may include, but need not be limited to, soil separation, soil
classification, vegetation, system use, localized well placement and construction, localized density
of systems and wells, extent of area to be covered by local standards, groundwater flow patterns,
and existing natural or artificial drainage systems. The local standards must provide cost-effective
and long-term treatment alternatives. The draft ordinance incorporating the local standards must be
submitted with justification to the commissioner 30 days before adoption for review and comment.
    (c) New or replacement systems; local ordinances. A local unit of government may adopt and
enforce ordinances or rules affecting new or replacement subsurface sewage treatment systems that
are more restrictive than the agency's rules. A local unit of government may not adopt or enforce an
ordinance or rule if its effect is to prevent or delay recording with the county recorder or registrar
of titles of a deed or other instrument that is otherwise entitled to be recorded.
    (d) Local standards; conflict with state law. Local standards adopted under paragraph (a) or
(b) must not conflict with any requirements under other state laws or rules or local ordinances,
including, but not limited to, requirements for:
   (1) systems in shoreland areas, regulated under sections 103F.201 to 103F.221;
   (2) well construction and location, regulated under chapter 103I; and
   (3) systems used in connection with food, beverage, and lodging establishments, regulated under
chapter 157.
Alternative local standards for new or replacement residential systems with flow of 2,500 gallons
per day or less may be applied to systems listed in clause (1), provided the alternative standards are
no less stringent than provisions of Minnesota Rules, chapter 7080, that went into effect on April
3, 2006. In addition, alternative local standards for new or replacement systems with flow of 2,500
gallons per day or less may be applied to systems listed in clause (3), provided the alternative
standards are no less stringent than provisions of Minnesota Rules, chapter 7080, that went into
effect on April 3, 2006, except that the waste strength must meet the standards established in
Minnesota Rules, part 7080.2150, subpart 3, item K. If additional treatment of waste is needed to
meet this standard, the treatment must be in accordance with Minnesota Rules, part 7080.2150,
subpart 3, item A. The local standards must include references to applicable requirements under
other state laws or rules or local ordinances. Nothing in this paragraph prevents a local subsurface
sewage treatment system ordinance from including provisions of the current rule as part of the
alternative local standards.
  Sec. 63. [115A.121] TOXICS AND POLLUTION PREVENTION EVALUATION;
CONSOLIDATED REPORT.
    The commissioner shall prepare and adopt a report on pollution prevention activities required
in chapters 115A, 115D, and 325E. The report must include activities required under section
115A.1320. The commissioner must submit the report to the senate and house of representatives
committees having jurisdiction over environment and natural resources by December 31, 2013,
and every four years thereafter.
   Sec. 64. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 115A.1320, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:

   Subdivision 1. Duties of the agency. (a) The agency shall administer sections 115A.1310 to
115A.1330.
   (b) The agency shall establish procedures for:
   (1) receipt and maintenance of the registration statements and certifications filed with the agency
under section 115A.1312; and
  (2) making the statements and certifications easily available to manufacturers, retailers, and
members of the public.
    (c) The agency shall annually review the value of the following variables that are part of
the formula used to calculate a manufacturer's annual registration fee under section 115A.1314,
subdivision 1:
   (1) the proportion of sales of video display devices sold to households that manufacturers are
required to recycle;
   (2) the estimated per-pound price of recycling covered electronic devices sold to households;
   (3) the base registration fee; and
    (4) the multiplier established for the weight of covered electronic devices collected in section
115A.1314, subdivision 1, paragraph (d). If the agency determines that any of these values must be
changed in order to improve the efficiency or effectiveness of the activities regulated under sections
115A.1312 to 115A.1330, the agency shall submit recommended changes and the reasons for them
to the chairs of the senate and house of representatives committees with jurisdiction over solid waste
policy.
   (d) By January 15 each year, beginning in 2008, the agency shall calculate estimated sales of
video display devices sold to households by each manufacturer during the preceding program year,
based on national sales data, and forward the estimates to the department.

each program year, the report must discuss the total weight of covered electronic devices recycled
and a summary of information in the reports submitted by manufacturers and recyclers under section
115A.1316. The report must also discuss the various collection programs used by manufacturers to
collect covered electronic devices; information regarding covered electronic devices that are being
collected by persons other than registered manufacturers, collectors, and recyclers; and information
about covered electronic devices, if any, being disposed of in landfills in this state. The report must
include a description of enforcement actions under sections 115A.1310 to 115A.1330. The agency
may include in its report other information received by the agency regarding the implementation of
sections 115A.1312 to 115A.1330. The report must be done in conjunction with the report required

     (1) achieving the maximum feasible reduction in waste generation;
    (2) encouraging manufacturers to design products that eliminate or reduce the adverse
environmental impacts of resource extraction, manufacturing, use, and waste processing and
disposal;
    (3) educating businesses, public entities, and other consumers about the need to consider the
potential environmental and financial impacts of purchasing products that may create a liability or
that may be expensive to recycle or manage as waste, due to the presence of toxic or hazardous
components;
   (4) eliminating or reducing toxic or hazardous components in compost from municipal solid
waste composting facilities, in ash from municipal solid waste incinerators, and in leachate and air
emissions from municipal solid waste landfills, in order to reduce the potential liability of waste
generators, facility owners and operators, and taxpayers;
    (5) encouraging the source separation of materials to the extent practicable, so that the materials
are most appropriately managed and to ensure that resources that can be reused or recycled are not
disposed of or destroyed; and
    (6) maximizing the efficiency of the waste management system by managing waste and
recyclables close to the point of generation, taking into account the characteristics of the resources
to be recovered from the waste and the type and capacity of local facilities.

generation;
     (2) for a metropolitan county, 50 percent by weight of total solid waste generation.
    Each county will develop and implement or require political subdivisions within the county to
develop and implement programs, practices, or methods designed to meet its recycling goal. Nothing
in this section or in any other law may be construed to prohibit a county from establishing a higher
recycling goal.

                                                 r July 1 of each year. The first progress reports are
due in 1992.
   (b) At a minimum, each progress report must include:
    (1) a summary of each objective established in the plan, including the base year for any objective
stated in numeric terms, and the schedule for meeting each objective;
    (2) a summary of progress made during the past year, if any, toward meeting each objective
established in the plan including the quantity of each toxic pollutant eliminated or reduced;
   (3) a statement of the methods through which elimination or reduction has been achieved;
    (4) if necessary, an explanation of the reasons objectives were not achieved during the previous
year, including identification of any technological, economic, or other impediments the facility faced
in its efforts to achieve its objectives; and
   (5) a certification, signed and dated by the facility manager and an officer of the company under
penalty of section 609.63, attesting that a plan meeting the requirements of section 115D.07 has
been prepared and also attesting to the accuracy of the information in the progress report.
    Subd. 2. Review of progress reports. (a) The commissioner of public safety shall review all
progress reports to determine if they meet the requirements of subdivision 1. If the commissioner of
public safety determines that a progress report does not meet the requirements, the commissioner of
public safety shall notify the facility in writing and shall identify specific deficiencies and specify a
reasonable time period of not less than 90 days for the facility to modify the progress report.
    (b) The commissioner of public safety shall be given access to a facility plan required under
section 115D.07 if the commissioner of public safety determines that the progress report for that
facility does not meet the requirements of subdivision 1. Twenty-five or more persons living within
ten miles of the facility may submit a petition to the commissioner of public safety that identifies
specific deficiencies in the progress report and requests the commissioner of public safety to review
the facility plan. Within 30 days after receipt of the petition, the commissioner of public safety shall
respond in writing. If the commissioner of public safety agrees that the progress report does not
meet requirements of subdivision 1, the commissioner of public safety shall be given access to the

facility plan.
    (c) After reviewing the plan and the progress report with any modifications submitted,
the commissioner of public safety shall state in writing whether the progress report meets the
requirements of subdivision 1. If the commissioner of public safety determines that a modified
progress report still does not meet the requirements of subdivision 1, the commissioner of public
safety shall schedule a public meeting. The meeting shall be held in the county where the facility is
located. The meeting is not subject to the requirements of chapter 14.
    (d) The facility shall be given the opportunity to amend the progress report within a period of
not less than 30 days after the public meeting.
    (e) If the commissioner of public safety determines that a modified progress report still does
not meet the requirements of subdivision 1, action may be taken under section 115.071 to obtain
compliance with sections 115D.01 to 115D.12.

every four years thereafter, to the governor and the legislature concerning the activities of the
Interstate Commission. The report shall include any recommendations the commissioner deems
necessary to assure the protection of the interest of the state in the proper functioning of the
compact. The commissioner also shall report to the governor and the legislature any time there is a
change in the status of a host state or other party states in the compact.
   Sec. 76. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 116D.04, subdivision 2a, as amended by
Laws 2012, chapter 150, article 2, section 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. When prepared. Where there is potential for significant environmental effects
resulting from any major governmental action, the action shall be preceded by a detailed
environmental impact statement prepared by the responsible governmental unit. The environmental
impact statement shall be an analytical rather than an encyclopedic document which describes the
proposed action in detail, analyzes its significant environmental impacts, discusses appropriate
alternatives to the proposed action and their impacts, and explores methods by which adverse
environmental impacts of an action could be mitigated. The environmental impact statement shall
also analyze those economic, employment and sociological effects that cannot be avoided should
the action be implemented. To ensure its use in the decision-making process, the environmental
impact statement shall be prepared as early as practical in the formulation of an action.
    (a) The board shall by rule establish categories of actions for which environmental impact
statements and for which environmental assessment worksheets shall be prepared as well as
categories of actions for which no environmental review is required under this section. A mandatory
environmental assessment worksheet shall not be required for the expansion of an ethanol plant,
as defined in section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), or the conversion of an ethanol plant
to a biobutanol facility or the expansion of a biobutanol facility as defined in section 41A.105,
subdivision 1a, based on the capacity of the expanded or converted facility to produce alcohol
fuel, but must be required if the ethanol plant or biobutanol facility meets or exceeds thresholds
of other categories of actions for which environmental assessment worksheets must be prepared.
The responsible governmental unit for an ethanol plant or biobutanol facility project for which
an environmental assessment worksheet is prepared shall be the state agency with the greatest
responsibility for supervising or approving the project as a whole.
    A mandatory environmental impact statement shall not be required for a facility or plant located
outside the seven-county metropolitan area that produces less than 125,000,000 gallons of ethanol,
biobutanol, or cellulosic biofuel annually, if the facility or plant is: an ethanol plant, as defined in
section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b); a biobutanol facility, as defined in section 41A.105,
subdivision 1a, clause (1); or a cellulosic biofuel facility, as defined in section 41A.10, subdivision
1, paragraph (d).
   (b) The responsible governmental unit shall promptly publish notice of the completion of an
environmental assessment worksheet ­n  i­ ­
                                          a by publishing the notice in at least one newspaper of
general circulation in the geographic area where the project is proposed, by posting the notice on
a Web site that has been designated as the official publication site for publication of proceedings,
public notices, and summaries of a political subdivision in which the project is proposed or in
6676                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [112TH DAY

any other manner ­ot­ b
                      ­­e determined by the board and shall provide copies of the environmental
assessment worksheet to the board and its member agencies. Comments on the need for an
environmental impact statement may be submitted to the responsible governmental unit during a
30-day period following publication of the notice that an environmental assessment worksheet has
been completed. The responsible governmental unit's decision on the need for an environmental
impact statement shall be based on the environmental assessment worksheet and the comments
received during the comment period, and shall be made within 15 days after the close of the
comment period. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not more than 15 additional
days upon the request of the responsible governmental unit.
    (c) An environmental assessment worksheet shall also be prepared for a proposed action
whenever material evidence accompanying a petition by not less than 100 individuals who reside
or own property in the state, submitted before the proposed project has received final approval
by the appropriate governmental units, demonstrates that, because of the nature or location of a
proposed action, there may be potential for significant environmental effects. Petitions requesting
the preparation of an environmental assessment worksheet shall be submitted to the board. The
chair of the board shall determine the appropriate responsible governmental unit and forward the
petition to it. A decision on the need for an environmental assessment worksheet shall be made by
the responsible governmental unit within 15 days after the petition is received by the responsible
governmental unit. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not more than 15 additional
days upon request of the responsible governmental unit.
   (d) Except in an environmentally sensitive location where Minnesota Rules, part 4410.4300,
subpart 29, item B, applies, the proposed action is exempt from environmental review under this
chapter and rules of the board, if:
   (1) the proposed action is:
   (i) an animal feedlot facility with a capacity of less than 1,000 animal units; or
   (ii) an expansion of an existing animal feedlot facility with a total cumulative capacity of less
than 1,000 animal units;
    (2) the application for the animal feedlot facility includes a written commitment by the proposer
to design, construct, and operate the facility in full compliance with Pollution Control Agency
feedlot rules; and
    (3) the county board holds a public meeting for citizen input at least ten business days prior
to the Pollution Control Agency or county issuing a feedlot permit for the animal feedlot facility
unless another public meeting for citizen input has been held with regard to the feedlot facility to be
permitted. The exemption in this paragraph is in addition to other exemptions provided under other
law and rules of the board.
    (e) The board may, prior to final approval of a proposed project, require preparation of an
environmental assessment worksheet by a responsible governmental unit selected by the board for
any action where environmental review under this section has not been specifically provided for by
rule or otherwise initiated.
    (f) An early and open process shall be utilized to limit the scope of the environmental impact
statement to a discussion of those impacts, which, because of the nature or location of the project,
112TH DAY]                         SATURDAY, APRIL 28, 2012                                      6677

have the potential for significant environmental effects. The same process shall be utilized to
determine the form, content and level of detail of the statement as well as the alternatives which
are appropriate for consideration in the statement. In addition, the permits which will be required
for the proposed action shall be identified during the scoping process. Further, the process shall
identify those permits for which information will be developed concurrently with the environmental
impact statement. The board shall provide in its rules for the expeditious completion of the scoping
process. The determinations reached in the process shall be incorporated into the order requiring
the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (g) The responsible governmental unit shall, to the extent practicable, avoid duplication and
ensure coordination between state and federal environmental review and between environmental
review and environmental permitting. Whenever practical, information needed by a governmental
unit for making final decisions on permits or other actions required for a proposed project shall
be developed in conjunction with the preparation of an environmental impact statement. When an
environmental impact statement is prepared for a project requiring multiple permits for which two
or more agencies' decision processes include either mandatory or discretionary hearings before a
hearing officer prior to the agencies' decision on the permit, the agencies may, notwithstanding any
law or rule to the contrary, conduct the hearings in a single consolidated hearing process if requested
by the proposer. All agencies having jurisdiction over a permit that is included in the consolidated
hearing shall participate. The responsible governmental unit shall establish appropriate procedures
for the consolidated hearing process, including procedures to ensure that the consolidated hearing
process is consistent with the applicable requirements for each permit regarding the rights and duties
of parties to the hearing, and shall utilize the earliest applicable hearing procedure to initiate the
hearing. The procedures of section 116C.28, subdivision 2, apply to the consolidated hearing.
    (h) An environmental impact statement shall be prepared and its adequacy determined within
280 days after notice of its preparation unless the time is extended by consent of the parties or
by the governor for good cause. The responsible governmental unit shall determine the adequacy
of an environmental impact statement, unless within 60 days after notice is published that an
environmental impact statement will be prepared, the board chooses to determine the adequacy of
an environmental impact statement. If an environmental impact statement is found to be inadequate,
the responsible governmental unit shall have 60 days to prepare an adequate environmental impact
statement.
    (i) The proposer of a specific action may include in the information submitted to the responsible
governmental unit a preliminary draft environmental impact statement under this section on
that action for review, modification, and determination of completeness and adequacy by the
responsible governmental unit. A preliminary draft environmental impact statement prepared by
the project proposer and submitted to the responsible governmental unit shall identify or include as
an appendix all studies and other sources of information used to substantiate the analysis contained
in the preliminary draft environmental impact statement. The responsible governmental unit shall
require additional studies, if needed, and obtain from the project proposer all additional studies and
information necessary for the responsible governmental unit to perform its responsibility to review,
modify, and determine the completeness and adequacy of the environmental impact statement.
   Sec. 77. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116D.04, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 15. Duplicative permit information; environmental assessment worksheets. To the
extent practicable and so as not to conflict with other requirements of this section, the board shall

not require, unless necessary, information in an environmental assessment worksheet for a proposed
action when the information is also required as part of any necessary permitting process for the
proposed action.
   Sec. 78. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116J.035, subdivision 8, as added by Laws 2012,
chapter 150, article 1, section 8, is amended to read:
   Subd. 8. Minnesota Business First Stop. (a) The commissioner of employment and economic
development shall, through the multiagency collaboration called "Minnesota Business First Stop,"
ensure the coordination, implementation, and administration of state permits, including:
    (1) establishing a mechanism in state government that will coordinate administrative
decision-making procedures and related quasijudicial and judicial review pertaining to permits
related to the state's air, land, and water resources;
    (2) providing coordination and understanding between federal, state, and local governmental
units in the administration of the various programs relating to air, water, and land resources;
   (3) identifying all existing state permits and other approvals, compliance schedules, or other
programs that pertain to the use of natural resources and protection of the environment; and
    (4) recommending legislative or administrative modifications to existing permit programs to
increase their efficiency and utility.
    (b) A person proposing a project may apply to Minnesota Business First Stop for assistance in
obtaining necessary state permits and other approvals. Upon request, the commissioner shall to the
extent practicable:
   (1) provide a list of all federal, state, and local permits and other required approvals for the
project;
    (2) provide a plan that will coordinate federal, state, and local administrative decision-making
practices, including monitoring, analysis and reporting, public comments and hearings, and
issuances of permits and approvals;
   (3) provide a timeline for the issuance of all federal, state, and local permits and other approvals
required for the project;
   (4) coordinate the execution of any memorandum of understanding between the person
proposing a project and any federal, state, or local agency;
   (5) coordinate all federal, state, or local public comment periods and hearings; and
   (6) provide other assistance requested to facilitate final approval and issuance of all federal, state,
and local permits and other approvals required for the project.
    (c) Notwithstanding section 16A.1283, as necessary, the commissioner may negotiate a schedule
to assess the project proposer for reasonable costs that any state agency incurs in coordinating the
implementation and administration of state permits, and the proposer shall pay the assessed costs to
the commissioner. Money received by the ­   en

shall address the state policies and purposes expressed in section 115A.02. In revising the plan
the commissioner shall follow the procedures in subdivision 3. The plan shall include goals and
policies for solid waste management, including recycling consistent with section 115A.551, and
household hazardous waste management consistent with section 115A.96, subdivision 6, in the
metropolitan area.
    The plan shall include criteria and standards for solid waste facilities and solid waste facility
sites respecting the following matters: general location; capacity; operation; processing techniques;
environmental impact; effect on existing, planned, or proposed collection services and waste
facilities; and economic viability. The plan shall, to the extent practicable and consistent with the
achievement of other public policies and purposes, encourage ownership and operation of solid
waste facilities by private industry. For solid waste facilities owned or operated by public agencies

or supported primarily by public funds or obligations issued by a public agency, the plan shall
include additional criteria and standards to protect comparable private and public facilities already
existing in the area from displacement unless the displacement is required in order to achieve the
waste management objectives identified in the plan. In revising the plan, the commissioner shall
consider the orderly and economic development, public and private, of the metropolitan area; the
preservation and best and most economical use of land and water resources in the metropolitan area;
the protection and enhancement of environmental quality; the conservation and reuse of resources
and energy; the preservation and promotion of conditions conducive to efficient, competitive,
and adaptable systems of waste management; and the orderly resolution of questions concerning
changes in systems of waste management. Criteria and standards for solid waste facilities shall be
consistent with rules adopted by the Pollution Control Agency pursuant to chapter 116 and shall
be at least as stringent as the guidelines, regulations, and standards of the federal Environmental
Protection Agency.

policy, and environment and natural resources finance. The report must include an assessment of
whether the objectives of the metropolitan abatement plan have been met and whether each county
and each class of city within each county have achieved the objectives set for it in the plan. The
report must recommend any legislation that may be required to implement the plan. The report shall
be included in the report required by section 115A.411. If in any year the commissioner reports
that the objectives of the abatement plan have not been met, the commissioner shall evaluate and
report on the need to reassign governmental responsibilities among cities, counties, and metropolitan
agencies to assure implementation and achievement of the metropolitan and local abatement plans
and objectives.
    The report must include a report on the operating, capital, and debt service costs of solid waste
facilities in the metropolitan area; changes in the costs; the methods used to pay the costs; and the
resultant allocation of costs among users of the facilities and the general public. The facility costs
report must present the cost and financing analysis in the aggregate and broken down by county and
by major facility.

The Honorable Kurt Zellers
Speaker of the House of Representatives
The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
    We, the undersigned conferees for H. F. No. 1870 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
    That the Senate recede from its amendments and that H. F. No. 1870 be further amended as
follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
    "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 122A.245, subdivision 1, is amended
to read:
   Subdivision 1. Requirements. (a) To improve academic excellence, improve ethnic and cultural
diversity in the classroom, and close the academic achievement gap, the Board of Teaching must
approve qualified teacher preparation programs under this section that are a means to acquire a
two-year limited-term license, which the board may renew one time for an additional one-year term,
and to prepare for acquiring a standard license. The following entities are eligible to participate
under this section:
   (1) a school district or charter school that forms a partnership with a college or university that
has a board-approved alternative teacher preparation program; or
   (2) a school district or charter school, after consulting with a college or university with a
board-approved teacher preparation program, forms a partnership with a nonprofit corporation
organized under chapter 317A for an education-related purpose that has a board-approved teacher
preparation program.
   (b) Before participating in this program, a candidate must:
    (1) have a bachelor's degree with a 3.0 or higher grade point average unless the board waives
the grade point average requirement based on board-adopted criteria;
   (2) pass the reading, writing, and mathematics skills examination under section 122A.09,
subdivision 4, paragraph (b); and
   (3) obtain qualifying scores on applicable board-approved rigorous content area and pedagogy
examinations under section 122A.09, subdivision 4, paragraph (e).
    (c) The Board of Teaching must issue a two-year limited-term license to a person who enrolls
in an alternative teacher preparation program. This limited-term license is not a provisional license
under section 122A.40 or 122A.41.
112TH DAY]                         SATURDAY, APRIL 28, 2012                                       6691

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 122A.40, subdivision 5, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 5. Probationary period. (a) The first three consecutive years of a teacher's first teaching
experience in Minnesota in a single district is deemed to be a probationary period of employment,
and, the probationary period in each district in which the teacher is thereafter employed shall be one
year. The school board must adopt a plan for written evaluation of teachers during the probationary
period that is consistent with subdivision 8. Evaluation must occur at least three times periodically
throughout each school year for a teacher performing services during that school year; the first
evaluation must occur within the first 90 days of teaching service. Days devoted to parent-teacher
conferences, teachers' workshops, and other staff development opportunities and days on which
a teacher is absent from school must not be included in determining the number of school days
on which a teacher performs services. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), during the
probationary period any annual contract with any teacher may or may not be renewed as the school
board shall see fit or consistent with the unrequested leave of absence plan in effect under subdivision
10 or 11. However, the board must give any such teacher whose contract it declines to renew for
the following school year written notice to that effect before June 1. If the teacher requests reasons
for any nonrenewal of a teaching contract, the board must give the teacher its reason in writing,
including a statement that appropriate supervision was furnished describing the nature and the extent
of such supervision furnished the teacher during the employment by the board, within ten days after
receiving such request. The school board may, after a hearing held upon due notice, discharge a
teacher during the probationary period for cause, effective immediately, under section 122A.44.
    (b) A board must discharge a probationary teacher, effective immediately, upon receipt of notice
under section 122A.20, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), that the teacher's license has been revoked due
to a conviction for child abuse or sexual abuse.
    (c) A probationary teacher whose first three years of consecutive employment are interrupted for
active military service and who promptly resumes teaching consistent with federal reemployment
timelines for uniformed service personnel under United States Code, title 38, section 4312(e), is
considered to have a consecutive teaching experience for purposes of paragraph (a).
    (d) A probationary teacher must complete at least 120 days of teaching service each year during
the probationary period. Days devoted to parent-teacher conferences, teachers' workshops, and other
staff development opportunities and days on which a teacher is absent from school do not count as
days of teaching service under this paragraph.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.40, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Negotiated unrequested leave of absence. (a) The school board and the exclusive
bargaining representative of the teachers m
                                          ­­­ must negotiate a plan providing for unrequested leave
                                           ay
of absence without pay or fringe benefits for as many teachers as may be necessary because of
discontinuance of position, lack of pupils, financial limitations, or merger of classes caused by
consolidation of districts. The plan must base unrequested leave of absence decisions on teachers'
subject matter licensure fields and evaluation outcomes, from the least to most effective category
under subdivision 8 and from the least to greatest seniority within each effectiveness category, and
6692                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [112TH DAY

must be consistent with subdivision 11, paragraph (n). Failing to successfully negotiate such a plan,
the provisions of subdivision 11 shall apply. The negotiated plan must not include provisions which
would result in the exercise of seniority by a teacher holding only a provisional license, other than a
vocational education license if required for the position, contrary to the provisions of subdivision 11,
­

               e­
                ) paragraph (f). The provisions of section 179A.16 do not apply for the purposes of this
subdivision.
    (b) For purposes of placing a teacher on unrequested leave of absence or recalling a teacher
from unrequested leave of absence, nothing in this subdivision requires a school board to reassign
a teacher in order to accommodate the seniority claims of another teacher. For purposes of this
subdivision, a provisional license is a license to teach issued by the Board of Teaching under a
waiver or variance.
    (c) Notwithstanding section 13.43, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause (5), or other law to
the contrary, a teacher's effectiveness category and the underlying data on the individual teacher
generated under the teacher evaluation process in subdivision 8, paragraph (b), used to determine a
teacher's effectiveness category for purposes of this subdivision are private data on individuals.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (c), the school board may make the effectiveness categories of
the teachers accessible to the exclusive representative of teachers for the purpose of verifying the
order of teachers' unrequested leave of absence.
    (e) Nothing in this subdivision permits a school board to use a teacher's remuneration as a basis
for making unrequested leave of absence or discharge decisions.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
negotiated plans agreed to after that date.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.40, subdivision 11, is amended to read:
    Subd. 11. Unrequested leave of absence. The board may place on unrequested leave of absence,
without pay or fringe benefits, as many teachers as may be necessary because of discontinuance
of position, lack of pupils, financial limitations, or merger of classes caused by consolidation or
reorganization of districts under chapter 123A. The unrequested leave is effective at the close of
the school year. In placing teachers on unrequested leave, the board is governed by the following
provisions:
    (a) The board may place probationary teachers on unrequested leave first in the inverse order
of their employment. A teacher who has acquired continuing contract rights must not be placed on
unrequested leave of absence while probationary teachers are retained in positions for which the
teacher who has acquired continuing contract rights is licensed;
                                                               ­.
    (b) Teachers who have acquired continuing contract rights shall be placed on unrequested leave
of absence in fields in which they are licensed in the inverse order in which they were employed
by the school district. In the case of equal seniority, the order in which teachers who have acquired
continuing contract rights shall be placed on unrequested leave of absence in fields in which they
are licensed is negotiable; ­.
   (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of ­
                                         c­a

which they have been given leaves of absence or, if not available, to other available positions in
the school district in fields in which they are licensed. Reinstatement must be in the inverse order
of placement on leave of absence. A teacher must not be reinstated to a position in a field in which
the teacher holds only a provisional license, other than a vocational education license if required
for the position, while another teacher who holds a nonprovisional license in the same field remains

provisions in this subdivision, a school board must place teachers on unrequested leave of absence
based on their subject matter licensure fields and most recent evaluation outcomes, from the least
to most effective category under subdivision 8 and from least to greatest seniority, including
probationary teachers, within each effectiveness category. A school board is not required to
reassign a teacher in order to accommodate the seniority claims of another teacher. A school board
may decide to renew or not renew a probationary teacher's contract as it sees fit. The school board
must make available to the public in a readily accessible format the unrequested leave of absence
plan it develops and implements under this paragraph.
   (o) For purposes of this subdivision, a provisional license is a license to teach issued by the
Board of Teaching under a waiver or variance.
    (p) Notwithstanding section 13.43, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause (5), or other law to
the contrary, a teacher's effectiveness category and the underlying data on the individual teacher
generated under the teacher evaluation process in subdivision 8, paragraph (b), used to determine a
teacher's effectiveness category for purposes of this subdivision are private data on individuals.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment except that
paragraph (n) is effective for the 2016-2017 school year and later.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.40, subdivision 19, is amended to read:
    Subd. 19. Records relating to individual teacher; access; expungement. All evaluations
and files generated within a school district relating to each individual teacher, including teacher
evaluation data under subdivisions 8, 10, and 11, among other teacher evaluations and files,
must be available to each individual teacher upon written request. Effective January 1, 1976, all
evaluations and files, wherever generated, relating to each individual teacher must be available to
each individual teacher upon written request. The teacher shall have the right to reproduce any
of the contents of the files at the teacher's expense and to submit for inclusion in the file written
information in response to any material contained therein.
    A district may destroy the files as provided by law and must expunge from the teacher's file
any material found to be false or inaccurate through the grievance procedure required pursuant
to section 179A.20, subdivision 4. The grievance procedure promulgated by the director of the
bureau of mediation services, pursuant to section 179A.04, subdivision 3, clause (h), applies to
those principals and supervisory employees not included in an appropriate unit as defined in section
179A.03. Expungement proceedings must be commenced within the time period provided in the

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 122A.41, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Probationary period; discharge or demotion. (a) All teachers in the public schools
in cities of the first class during the first three years of consecutive employment shall be deemed
to be in a probationary period of employment during which period any annual contract with any
teacher may, or may not, be renewed as the school board, after consulting with the peer review
committee charged with evaluating the probationary teachers under subdivision 3, shall see fit or
consistent with the service termination plan in effect under subdivision 6 or 14. The school site
management team or the school board if there is no school site management team, shall adopt a
plan for a written evaluation of teachers during the probationary period according to subdivisions
3 and 5. Evaluation by the peer review committee charged with evaluating probationary teachers
under subdivision 3 shall occur at least three times periodically throughout each school year for a
teacher performing services during that school year; the first evaluation must occur within the first
90 days of teaching service. Days devoted to parent-teacher conferences, teachers' workshops, and
other staff development opportunities and days on which a teacher is absent from school shall not
be included in determining the number of school days on which a teacher performs services. The
school board may, during such probationary period, discharge or demote a teacher for any of the
causes as specified in this code. A written statement of the cause of such discharge or demotion shall
be given to the teacher by the school board at least 30 days before such removal or demotion shall
become effective, and the teacher so notified shall have no right of appeal therefrom.
    (b) A probationary teacher whose first three years of consecutive employment are interrupted for
active military service and who promptly resumes teaching consistent with federal reemployment
timelines for uniformed service personnel under United States Code, title 38, section 4312(e), is
considered to have a consecutive teaching experience for purposes of paragraph (a).
    (c) A probationary teacher must complete at least 120 days of teaching service each year during
the probationary period. Days devoted to parent-teacher conferences, teachers' workshops, and other
staff development opportunities and days on which a teacher is absent from school do not count as
days of teaching service under this paragraph.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 122A.41, subdivision 6, is amended to
read:
     Subd. 6. Grounds for discharge or demotion. (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph
­
(b
 ­­) (d), causes for the discharge or demotion of a teacher either during or after the probationary
period must be:
   (1) immoral character, conduct unbecoming a teacher, or insubordination;
   (2) failure without justifiable cause to teach without first securing the written release of the school
board having the care, management, or control of the school in which the teacher is employed;
   (3) inefficiency in teaching or in the management of a school, consistent with subdivision 5,

paragraph (b);
    (4) affliction with active tuberculosis or other communicable disease must be considered as cause
for removal or suspension while the teacher is suffering from such disability; or
    (5) discontinuance of position or lack of pupils.
    Beginning in the 2016-2017 school year and later, and notwithstanding any contradictory
provisions in this subdivision, the school board must discharge or demote teachers under clause
(5) based on their subject matter licensure fields and most recent evaluation outcomes, from the
least to most effective category under subdivision 5 and from least to greatest seniority, including
probationary teachers, within each effectiveness category. Nothing in this subdivision permits
a school board to use a teacher's remuneration as the basis for making discharge or demotion
decisions. The school board must make available to the public in a readily accessible format any
discharge and demotion plan it develops to implement clause (5) of this paragraph.
   For purposes of this paragraph, conduct unbecoming a teacher includes an unfair discriminatory
practice described in section 363A.13.
    (b) Notwithstanding section 13.43, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause (5), or other law to
the contrary, a teacher's effectiveness category and the underlying data on the individual teacher
generated under the teacher evaluation process in subdivision 5, paragraph (b), used to determine a
teacher's effectiveness category for purposes of this subdivision are private data on individuals.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the school board may make the effectiveness categories of
the teachers accessible to the exclusive representative of teachers for the purpose of verifying the
order of teachers' discharge and demotion.
   ­(b
     ­­) (d) A probationary or continuing-contract teacher must be discharged immediately upon
receipt of notice under section 122A.20, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), that the teacher's license has
been revoked due to a conviction for child abuse or sexual abuse.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
negotiated plans agreed to after that date.
    Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.41, subdivision 14, is amended to read:
     Subd. 14. Services terminated by discontinuance or lack of pupils; preference given. (a) To
the extent consistent with paragraph (c) and subdivision 6, paragraph (a), clause (5), a teacher whose
services are terminated on account of discontinuance of position or lack of pupils must receive first
consideration for other positions in the district for which that teacher is qualified. ­In

   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.41, subdivision 15, is amended to read:
    Subd. 15. Records relating to individual teacher; access; expungement. All evaluations and
files generated within a district relating to each individual teacher, including teacher evaluation data
under subdivisions 5, 6, and 14, among other teacher evaluations and files, must be available to each
individual teacher upon the teacher's written request. Effective January 1, 1976, all evaluations and
files, wherever generated, relating to each individual teacher must be available to each individual
teacher upon the teacher's written request. The teacher has the right to reproduce any of the contents
of the files at the teacher's expense and to submit for inclusion in the file written information in
response to any material contained therein.
    A district may destroy the files as provided by law and must expunge from the teacher's file
any material found to be false or substantially inaccurate through the grievance procedure required
pursuant to section 179A.20, subdivision 4. The grievance procedure promulgated by the director of
the Bureau of Mediation Services, pursuant to section 179A.04, subdivision 3, clause (h), applies to
those principals and supervisory employees not included in an appropriate unit as defined in section
179A.03. Expungement proceedings must be commenced within the time period provided in the
collective bargaining agreement for the commencement of a grievance. If no time period is provided
in the bargaining agreement, the expungement proceedings must commence within 15 days after the
teacher has knowledge of the inclusion in the teacher's file of the material the teacher seeks to have
expunged.

district is divided or the dissolution of a district and its attachment to two or more existing districts,
each teacher employed by an affected district shall be assigned to the newly created or enlarged
district on the basis of a ratio of the pupils assigned to each district according to the new district
boundaries. The district receiving the greatest number of pupils must be assigned the teacher with
the greatest seniority, and the remaining teachers must be alternately assigned to each district until
the district receiving the fewest pupils has received its ratio of teachers who will not be retiring
before the effective date of the consolidation or dissolution.

    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), the board and the exclusive representative of teachers in
each district involved in the consolidation or dissolution and attachment may negotiate a plan for
assigning teachers to each newly created or enlarged district.

         i­y­ take effect until the rules are approved by a law enacted after the agency determination
or administrative law judge disapproval.
   Subd. 4. Exceptions. (a) Subdivision 3 does not apply if the administrative law judge approves
an agency's determination that the legislature has appropriated money to sufficiently fund the
expected cost of the rule upon the business or city proposed to be regulated by the rule.
    (b) Subdivision 3 does not apply if the administrative law judge approves an agency's
determination that the rule has been proposed pursuant to a specific federal statutory or regulatory
mandate.
   (c) This section does not apply if the rule is adopted under section 14.388 or under another law
specifying that the rulemaking procedures of this chapter do not apply.
     (d) This section does not apply to a rule adopted by the Public Utilities Commission.
    (e) Subdivision 3 does not apply if the governor waives application of subdivision 3. The
governor may issue a waiver at any time, either before or after the rule would take effect, but
for the requirement of legislative approval. As soon as possible after issuing a waiver under this
paragraph, the governor must send notice of the waiver to the speaker of the house and the president
of the senate and must publish notice of this determination in the State Register. A waiver under
this paragraph must be maintained as part of the rulemaking record under section 14.365. A waiver
issued by the governor under this paragraph is effective until the next adjournment of an annual
regular legislative session after the governor issues the waiver.
   Subd. 5. Severability. If an administrative law judge determines that part of a proposed rule
exceeds the threshold specified in subdivision 1, but that a severable portion of a proposed rule
does not exceed the threshold in subdivision 1, the administrative law judge may provide that the
severable portion of the rule that does not exceed the threshold may take effect without legislative
approval.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment, and applies
to any rule for which the hearing record has not closed before that date or, if there is not a public
hearing, for which the agency has not submitted the record to the administrative law judge before
that date."

Transmissions of telecasts or simulcasts are only authorized if they are conducted pursuant to
a written agreement between the tribal government receiving the signal and a licensee who is
authorized to conduct live racing, at the licensee's facility, of the breed involved in the telecast or
simulcast. The written agreement is not valid or effective unless it is approved by the commission.
The agreement must be enforceable only in state courts. The term of the written agreement shall
not exceed five years. The agreement may be renewed after review and approval, not earlier than
six months before the end of the term, by the commission. With prior approval of the commission,
a licensed racetrack transmitting telecasts of races it conducts, to sites on Indian lands within or
outside of Minnesota or to other locations outside the state, may commingle the amounts bet at the
receiving entity with the pools at the sending licensed racetrack."

The Honorable Kurt Zellers
Speaker of the House of Representatives
The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate

112TH DAY]                           SATURDAY, APRIL 28, 2012                                          6711

                                              "ARTICLE 1
                                     GAME AND FISH POLICY
    Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 84.027, subdivision 14, is amended to read:
    Subd. 14. Mission; efficiency. It is part of the department's mission that within the department's
resources the commissioner shall endeavor to:
    (1) prevent the waste or unnecessary spending of public money;
    (2) use innovative fiscal and human resource practices to manage the state's resources and operate
the department as efficiently as possible;
   (3) coordinate the department's activities wherever appropriate with the activities of other
governmental agencies;
    (4) use technology where appropriate to increase agency productivity, improve customer service,
increase public access to information about government, and increase public participation in the
business of government;
   (5) utilize constructive and cooperative labor-management practices to the extent otherwise
required by chapters 43A and 179A;
   (6) report to the legislature on the performance of agency operations and the accomplishment of
agency goals in the agency's biennial budget according to section 16A.10, subdivision 1; ­an
                                                                                           ­­d
   (7) recommend to the legislature appropriate changes in law necessary to carry out the mission
and improve the performance of the department; and
    (8) plan and implement activities designed to recruit new outdoor recreation participants,
including youth, women, and minorities, and retain existing participants. This includes but is not
limited to anglers, hunters, trappers, and campers.
    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 84.027, subdivision 15, is amended to read:
    Subd. 15. Electronic transactions. (a) The commissioner may receive an application for, sell,
and issue any license, stamp, permit, pass, sticker, gift card, safety training certification, registration,
or transfer under the jurisdiction of the commissioner by electronic means, including by telephone.
Notwithstanding section 97A.472, electronic and telephone transactions may be made outside of
the state. The commissioner may:
    (1) provide for the electronic transfer of funds generated by electronic transactions, including
by telephone;
    (2) assign an identification number to an applicant who purchases a hunting or fishing license or
recreational vehicle registration by electronic means, to serve as temporary authorization to engage
in the activity requiring a license or registration until the license or registration is received or expires;
    (3) charge and permit agents to charge a fee of individuals who make electronic transactions and
transactions by telephone or Internet, including issuing fees and an additional transaction fee not to
exceed $3.50;
6712                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [112TH DAY

    (4) charge and permit agents to charge a convenience fee not to exceed three percent of the cost of
the license to individuals who use electronic bank cards for payment. An electronic licensing system
agent charging a fee of individuals making an electronic bank card transaction in person must post
a sign informing individuals of the fee. The sign must be near the point of payment, clearly visible,
include the amount of the fee, and state: "License agents are allowed by state law to charge a fee
not to exceed three percent of the cost of state licenses to persons who use electronic bank cards for
payment. The fee is not required by state law.";
    (5) establish, by written order, an electronic licensing system commission to be paid by revenues
generated from all sales made through the electronic licensing system. The commissioner shall
establish the commission in a manner that neither significantly overrecovers nor underrecovers costs
involved in providing the electronic licensing system; and
   (6) adopt rules to administer the provisions of this subdivision.
    (b) The fees established under paragraph (a), clauses (3) and (4), and the commission established
under paragraph (a), clause (5), are not subject to the rulemaking procedures of chapter 14 and
section 14.386 does not apply.
    (c) Money received from fees and commissions collected under this subdivision, including
interest earned, is annually appropriated from the game and fish fund and the natural resources
fund to the commissioner for the cost of electronic licensing.
    (d) Game and fish licenses under chapters 97A, 97B, and 97C shall be available by electronic
transaction, regardless of whether all or any part of the biennial appropriation law for the
department has been enacted. If, by July 1 of an odd-numbered year, legislation has not been
enacted to appropriate money to the commissioner of management and budget for central
accounting, procurement, payroll, and human resources functions, amounts necessary to operate
those functions for the purpose of this paragraph are appropriated from the general fund to the
commissioner of management and budget. As necessary, the commissioner may transfer a portion
of this appropriation to other state agencies to support carrying out these functions. Any subsequent
appropriation to the commissioner of management and budget for a biennium in which this section
is applicable supersedes and replaces the funding authorized in this paragraph.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 84.085, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Authority. (a) The commissioner of natural resources may accept for and on
behalf of the state any gift, bequest, devise, or grants of lands or interest in lands or personal property
of any kind or of money tendered to the state for any purpose pertaining to the activities of the
department or any of its divisions. Any money so received is hereby appropriated and dedicated
for the purpose for which it is granted. Lands and interests in lands so received may be sold or
exchanged as provided in chapter 94. The deed conveying land or an interest in land to the state
under this paragraph must clearly indicate whether the state may resell the donated land or interest
in land.
    (b) When the commissioner of natural resources accepts lands or interests in land, the
commissioner may reimburse the donor for costs incurred to obtain an appraisal needed for tax
reporting purposes. If the state pays the donor for a portion of the value of the lands or interests
in lands that are donated, the reimbursement for appraisal costs shall not exceed $1,500. If the
donor receives no payment from the state for the lands or interests in lands that are donated, the
112TH DAY]                               SATURDAY, APRIL 28, 2012                                                  6713

reimbursement for appraisal costs shall not exceed $5,000.
    (c) The commissioner of natural resources, on behalf of the state, may accept and use grants
of money or property from the United States or other grantors for conservation purposes not
inconsistent with the laws of this state. Any money or property so received is hereby appropriated
and dedicated for the purposes for which it is granted, and shall be expended or used solely for
such purposes in accordance with the federal laws and regulations pertaining thereto, subject to
applicable state laws and rules as to manner of expenditure or use providing that the commissioner
may make subgrants of any money received to other agencies, units of local government, private
individuals, private organizations, and private nonprofit corporations. Appropriate funds and
accounts shall be maintained by the commissioner of management and budget to secure compliance
with this section.
    (d) The commissioner may accept for and on behalf of the permanent school fund a donation
of lands, interest in lands, or improvements on lands. A donation so received shall become state
property, be classified as school trust land as defined in section 92.025, and be managed consistent
with section 127A.31. When the commissioner proposes to accept a donation of land or an interest
in land, the commissioner must notify the landowner of the option to express in the deed whether
the state may resell the land.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 84.82, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
