The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
Dear Madam President:
    I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 191, Senate File 2183, a bill that prohibits the
Commissioner of Education from enforcing unadopted rules. This bill is a disappointing attempt to
strip away the powers expressly granted to the executive branch by the Minnesota Constitution.
   Education Commissioner Cassellius and her staff have repeatedly expressed their concerns to
your members that Senate File 2183 interferes with one of the primary functions of the Minnesota
107TH DAY]                           MONDAY, APRIL 23, 2012                                          5999

Department of Education (MDE): ensuring that both state and federal laws and rules are followed.
According to Article V, § 3 of the Minnesota Constitution, the Governor must "take care that the laws
be faithfully executed." This constitutionally granted executive authority is carried out by executive
agencies. By rendering MDE pronouncements unenforceable, this bill effectively eliminates the
ability of MDE to provide interpretation, clarification, and guidance to schools and districts, and
conflicts with the functions of the executive branch. It is clear this attempt to strip away this executive
authority is in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers under Article III, § 1 of the Minnesota
Constitution.
   The bill also undermines MDE's ability to oversee, implement and enforce federal education
laws, thereby putting Minnesota's federal education funding in jeopardy. MDE is required to
submit assurances to the U.S. Department of Education that it enforces federal education laws as
a condition of continued federal funding. This bill, requiring notice to districts that virtually any
written statement by MDE is unenforceable, calls into question MDE's assurances to the federal
government that it has the authority or ability to enforce federal laws.
    Furthermore, this bill could adversely affect the education some students receive. Through the
years, the legislature has taken great care and deliberation to craft laws that protect Minnesota's
students. By stripping away MDE's ability to properly enforce those statutes, this bill leaves children
without the protections of law. Under this bill, if MDE received a complaint from a parent who
believed their child was not being provided adequate education services under the law, MDE could
issue support and guidance to comply with current law, but the school could simply choose to ignore
that guidance as unenforceable if they disagreed with MDE's interpretation of the law. This could
leave the parent in limbo and the child deprived of an equal and adequate education. This bill could
also result in reduced educational expectations for some students. If MDE received a complaint that
a school was graduating students who had not met the required academic standards, MDE could
issue a corrective action; but the school could ignore the action as unenforceable.
    I should also point out that this bill is a solution in search of a problem. The Administrative
Procedures Act (APA), states "an agency determination is not considered an unadopted rule
when the agency enforces current law or rule by applying the law or rule to specific facts on a
case-by-case basis." Minn. Stat. § 14.381, subd. 1(b). However, if a school or district believes
MDE has overstepped this authority, § 14.381 provides a remedy. The APA and the Office of
Administrative Hearings (OAH) were established to provide a fair, prompt, and impartial hearing
process for citizens who disagree with actions taken by the government. Under the APA, any
person may petition the OAH if an agency enforces a pronouncement that is outside the bounds of
existing law or rule. An OAH administrative law judge has statutory authority to determine if an
agency pronouncement is being enforced as an unadopted rule. This bill is unnecessary because
a remedy already exists in law.
    Commissioner Cassellius and her department have worked diligently over the past year to foster
a spirit of school support, rather than one only responsible for strict monitoring and enforcement.
As such, MDE exercises its authority to issue pronouncements cautiously, evidenced by the very
few pronouncements that have been issued over the course of the past year. While the use of these
pronouncements is limited, they are a proper use of executive agency authority and an essential tool
in ensuring legislation created by your body is enforced properly. This attempt to strip away that
important executive authority is unacceptable.

   For these reasons, I am vetoing this bill.
                                                    Sincerely,
                                                    Mark Dayton, Governor
   Senator Senjem moved that S.F. No. 2183 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

                                                                                    April 23, 2012
The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
Dear Madam President:
   I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 213, Senate File 247, a bill requiring local government
employers to approve participation in or withdrawal from the Public Employees' Insurance
Program (PEIP). PEIP has generated millions of dollars in savings for public employees, their local
government employers, and taxpayers across our state. It is troubling that the legislature would
consider a measure like this to restrict competition in the insurance marketplace.
    PEIP provides coverage for approximately 5,000 police officers, teachers, maintenance workers,
and other local employees statewide. More than half of its 83 participating groups have 26 or fewer
employees and 32 have 10 or fewer employees. PEIP pools small groups of local employees into
larger pools, resulting in lower cost coverage than a local unit of government may be able to obtain
elsewhere.
    We should be encouraging employees to seek competitive bids for their health care coverage,
not adding additional barriers to exploring options. Creating a new step in the approval process
for police officers, teachers, maintenance workers, and local employees, as they attempt to access
affordable health care is ill-advised.
   The bill does nothing to encourage competition between private insurance companies. To
control increasing health care costs for public employees, their employers, and, ultimately,
Minnesota taxpayers, we need to give them more ways to access a competitive market place, rather
than place restrictions on the options currently available to them.
                                                    Sincerely,
                                                    Mark Dayton, Governor
   Senator Senjem moved that S.F. No. 247 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table. The
motion prevailed.

   Sec. 7. [473J.01] PURPOSE.
    The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the construction, financing, and long-term use of a
stadium and related stadium infrastructure as a venue for professional football and a broad range of
other civic, community, athletic, educational, cultural, and commercial activities. The legislature
finds and declares that the expenditure of public money for this purpose is necessary and serves
a public purpose, and that property acquired by the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority for
the construction of the stadium and related stadium infrastructure is acquired for a public use or
public purpose under chapter 117. The legislature further finds and declares that any provision in
a lease or use agreement with a professional football team that requires the team to play all of its
home games in a publicly funded stadium for the duration of the lease or use agreement, with the
occasional exception of a game played elsewhere as set forth in such agreement, serves a unique
public purpose for which the remedies of specific performance and injunctive relief are essential to
its enforcement. The legislature further finds and declares that government assistance to facilitate
the presence of professional football provides to the state of Minnesota and its citizens highly
valued intangible benefits that are virtually impossible to quantify and, therefore, not recoverable
even if the government receives monetary damages in the event of a team's breach of contract.
Minnesota courts are, therefore, charged with protecting those benefits through the use of specific
performance and injunctive relief as provided in this chapter and in the lease and use agreements.

amount received in the year prior to the preceding year, expressed as a percentage of the amount
received in the year prior to the preceding year; provided, that the adjustment factor for any year
must not be less than zero percent nor more than five percent.

advance of the request for proposals, and select a short list of responsible offerors prior to discussions
and evaluations.
    (e) As provided in the request for proposals, the authority, and the NFL team, may conduct
discussions and negotiations with responsible offerors in order to determine which proposal is most
advantageous to the authority and the NFL team and to negotiate the terms of an agreement. In

    (f) Prior to the time the authority enters into a construction contract with a construction manager
or program manager certifying a maximum price and a completion date as provided in paragraph
(h), at the request of the NFL team, the authority may authorize, such authorization not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, the NFL team to provide for management of the construction of

    (2) award contracts to the contractors that the construction manager or program manager
determines provide the best value under a request for proposals as described in section 16C.28,
subdivision 1, paragraphs (a), clause (2), and (c), which are not required to be the lowest responsible
bidder; and
     (3) for work the construction manager or program manager determines to be critical to the
completion schedule, award contracts on the basis of competitive proposals, or perform work with
its own forces without soliciting competitive bids if the construction manager or program manager
provides evidence of competitive pricing.
    (h) The authority and the NFL team shall require that the construction manager or program
manager certify, before the contract is signed, a fixed and stipulated construction price and
completion date to the authority and post a performance bond in an amount at least equal to 100
percent of the certified price or such other security satisfactory to the authority, to cover any costs
which may be incurred in excess of the certified price including, but not limited to, costs incurred
by the authority or loss of revenues resulting from incomplete construction on the completion
date. The authority may secure surety bonds as provided in section 574.26, securing payment of

    Subd. 4. Cost overruns, savings. The authority may accept financial obligations relating to cost
overruns associated with acquisition of the stadium site, stadium infrastructure, and stadium design,
development, and construction, provided that the authority shall not accept responsibility for cost
overruns and shall not be responsible for cost overruns if the authority has authorized the NFL team
to provide for management of construction of the stadium under subdivision 1. Cost savings or
additional funds obtained by the authority or the NFL team for the stadium or stadium infrastructure
may be used first to fund additional stadium or stadium infrastructure, as agreed to by the authority
and the NFL team, if any, and then to fund capital reserves.
   Sec. 14. [473J.112] COMMEMORATIVE BRICKS.
   The authority shall sell commemorative bricks to be displayed at a prominent location in the
new stadium, for an amount to be determined by the authority. The authority shall work with the

commissioner of management and budget for a grant to the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 15. [473J.12] EMPLOYMENT.
    Subdivision 1. Hiring and recruitment. In the design, development, construction, management,
operation, maintenance and capital repair, replacement and improvement of the stadium and
stadium infrastructure, the authority shall make every effort to employ, and cause the NFL team,
the construction manager and other subcontractors, vendors, and concessionaires to employ women
and members of minority communities when hiring. Further, goals for construction contracts to be
awarded to women- and minority-owned businesses will be in a percentage at least equal to the
minimum used for city of Minneapolis development projects, and the other construction workforce
will establish workforce utilization goals at least equal to current city goals and include workers
from city zip codes that have high rates of poverty and unemployment.
    Subd. 2. Other required agreements. The NFL team or the authority shall give food, beverage,
retail, and concession workers presently employed by the NFL team or the Metropolitan Sports
Facilities Commission or its vendors at the existing football stadium the opportunity to continue their
employment in comparable positions at the new stadium. Workers who are presently represented

company or individual to manage the stadium and on certain major vendors to the stadium. The
authority, with the approval of the NFL team, may enter into an agreement with a program manager
for management of the stadium, for a maximum of 40 years.

107TH DAY]                         MONDAY, APRIL 23, 2012                                       6017

of the stadium. The authority must require in the lease or use agreement with the NFL team that the
NFL team pay the authority, beginning January 1, 2016, or other date as mutually agreed upon by the
parties, toward operating costs of the stadium, $8,500,000 each year, increased by a three percent
annual inflation rate. Beginning January 1, 2016, or other date as mutually agreed upon by the
parties, the state shall pay the authority toward operating expenses, $6,000,000 each year, increased
by an annual adjustment factor. The authority may establish an operating reserve to cover operating
expense shortfalls and may accept funds from any source for deposit in the operating reserve. The
establishment or funding of an authority operating reserve must not decrease the amounts required
to be paid to the authority toward operating costs under this subdivision unless agreed to by the
authority. The authority will be responsible for operating cost overruns. After the joint selection
of the third-party manager or program manager, the authority may agree with a program manager
or other third-party manager of the stadium on a fixed cost operating, management, or employment
agreement with operating cost protections under which the program manager or third-party manager
assumes responsibility for stadium operating costs and shortfalls. The agreement with the manager
must require the manager to prepare an initial and ongoing operating plan and operating budgets for
approval by the authority in consultation with the NFL team. The manager must agree to operate
the stadium in accordance with the approved operating plan and operating budget.

sports, community, and civic events, and other public events in type and on terms consistent with
those currently held at the existing football stadium, as defined in section 473.551, subdivision 9.
The authority may provide that these events have exclusive use of the premises at agreed-upon times
subject to the scheduling rights of the NFL team under the lease or use agreement.
    Subd. 4. Capital improvements. (a) The authority shall establish a capital reserve fund.
The authority shall be responsible for making, or for causing others to make, all capital repairs,
replacements, and improvements for the stadium and stadium infrastructure. The authority shall
maintain, or cause others to maintain, the stadium and stadium infrastructure in a safe, clean,
attractive, and first-class manner so as to cause them to remain in a condition comparable to that
of other comparable NFL facilities of similar design and age. The authority shall make, or cause
others to make, all necessary or appropriate repairs, renewals, and replacements, whether structural
or nonstructural, interior or exterior, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen, in a prompt
and timely manner. In addition, the authority, with approval of the NFL team, may enter into an
agreement with a program manager to perform some or all of the responsibilities of the authority
in this subdivision and to assume and accept financial liability for the cost of performing the
responsibilities.
    (b) The NFL team must contribute $1,500,000 each year, beginning in 2016 or as otherwise
determined for the term of the lease or use agreement to the operating reserve fund, increased by a
three percent annual inflation rate.
    (c) The state shall contribute $1,500,000 each year, beginning in 2016 or as otherwise determined
for the term of the lease to the operating reserve fund. The contributions of the state are subject to
increase by an annual adjustment factor.
    (d) The authority, with input from the NFL team, shall develop short-term and long-term capital
funding plans and shall use those plans to guide the future capital needs of the stadium and stadium
infrastructure. The authority shall make the final determination with respect to funding capital
needs. Any capital improvement proposed by the NFL team intended primarily to provide revenue
6018                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [107TH DAY

enhancements to the NFL team shall be paid for by the NFL team, unless otherwise agreed to with
the authority.
    Subd. 5. Game day payments. In addition to operating expense contributions of the NFL
team under subdivision 2, the NFL team shall pay all NFL game day, NFL team-owned major
league soccer, as provided in section 473J.15, subdivision 15, and other NFL team sponsored event
expenses within the stadium and stadium plaza areas.
    Subd. 6. Cooperation with financing. The authority will cooperate with the NFL team to
facilitate the financing of the NFL team's contribution. Such agreement to cooperate shall not
require the authority to incur any additional costs or provide conduit financing. The lease, license,
and other transaction documents shall include provisions customarily required by lenders in
stadium financings.
   Sec. 17. [473J.15] CRITERIA AND CONDITIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Binding and enforceable. In developing the stadium and entering into related
contracts, the authority must follow and enforce the criteria and conditions in this section, provided
that a determination by the authority that those criteria or conditions have been met under any
agreement or otherwise shall be conclusive.
     Subd. 2. NFL team/private contribution; timing of expenditures. The NFL team/private
contribution, including stadium builder license proceeds, for stadium costs must be made in cash
in the amount of at least $427,000,000. Prior to the initial deposit of funds under this section, the
team must provide security or other credit worthiness in the amount of $50,000,000, subject to
the satisfaction of the authority. Prior to the first issuance of bonds under section 16A.965, the
first portion of the NFL team/private contribution in the amount of $50,000,000 must be deposited
as costs are incurred to the construction fund to pay for the initial stadium costs. After the first
$50,000,000 of stadium costs have been paid from the initial NFL team/private contribution,
state funds shall be deposited as costs are incurred to the construction fund to pay for the next
$50,000,000 of costs of the project. Prior to any state funds being deposited in the construction
fund, the NFL team must provide security or a financing commitment reasonably satisfactory
to the authority for the balance of the required NFL team/private contribution and for payment
of cost overruns if the NFL team assumes responsibility for stadium construction under section
473J.11. Thereafter budgeted project costs shall be borne by the authority and the NFL team/private
contributions in amounts proportionate to their remaining funding commitments. In the event the
project terminates before the initial $100,000,000 in contributions are expended by the parties
under this subdivision, the parties shall be reimbursed in the amounts they have deposited to the
construction fund proportionate to project funding percentages, in the amounts of 56 percent by the
authority and 44 percent by the NFL team/private contributions.
    Subd. 3. Lease or use agreements; 40-year term. The authority must enter into a long-term
lease or use agreement with the NFL team for the NFL team's use of the stadium. The NFL team must
agree to play all preseason, regular season, and postseason home games at the stadium. Training
facilities must remain in Minnesota during the term of the lease or use agreement. The lease or
use agreement must be for a term of at least 40 years from the date of substantial completion of
the stadium for professional football games. The lease or use agreement may provide options for
the NFL team to extend the term for up to four additional periods of five years. The lease or use
agreement must include terms for default, termination, and breach of the agreement. Recognizing
107TH DAY]                          MONDAY, APRIL 23, 2012                                        6019

that the presence of professional football provides to the state of Minnesota and its citizens highly
valued, intangible benefits that are virtually impossible to quantify and, therefore, not recoverable
in the event of the NFL team owner's breach of contract, the lease and use agreements must provide
for specific performance and injunctive relief to enforce provisions relating to use of the stadium for
professional football and must not include escape clauses or buyout provisions. The NFL team must
not enter into or accept any agreement or requirement with or from any entity that is inconsistent
with the NFL team's binding commitment to the 40-year term of the lease or use agreement or that
would in any manner dilute, interfere with, or negate the provisions of the lease or use agreement,
providing for specific performance or injunctive relief. The legislature conclusively determines, as a
matter of public policy, that the lease or use agreement, and any grant agreement under this chapter
that includes a specific performance clause:
   (1) explicitly authorizes specific performance as a remedy for breach;
   (2) is made for adequate consideration and upon terms which are otherwise fair and reasonable;
   (3) has not been included through sharp practice, misrepresentation, or mistake;
    (4) if specifically enforced, does not cause unreasonable or disproportionate hardship or loss to
the NFL team or to third parties; and
    (5) involves performance in a manner and the rendering of services of a nature and under
circumstances that the beneficiary cannot be adequately compensated in damages.
    Subd. 4. Lease or use agreements; revenues, payments. A lease or use agreement shall include
rent and other fees and expenses to be paid by the NFL team. The authority shall agree to provide
in the lease or use agreement for the NFL team to receive all NFL and team event related revenues,
including, but not limited to, suite revenues, advertising, concessions, signage, broadcast and media,
and club seat revenue. The agreement shall also provide that all naming rights to the stadium are
retained by the NFL team, subject to the approval of the name or names by the authority consistent
with those criteria set out in the lease or use agreement. The agreement shall provide for the authority
to receive all general ticket revenues and other event revenues other than from NFL team games,
NFL team owned major league soccer games, and other NFL team events agreed to by the authority.
    Subd. 5. Notice of breach or default. Until 40 years from the date of stadium completion, the
NFL team must provide written notice to the authority not less than 180 days prior to any action,
including any action imposed upon the NFL team by the NFL, which would result in a breach or
default of provisions of the lease or use agreements required to be included under subdivision 3. If
this notice provision is violated and the NFL team has already breached or been in default under the
required provisions, the authority or the state of Minnesota may specifically enforce the lease or use
agreement and Minnesota courts shall fashion equitable remedies so that the NFL team fulfills the
conditions of the lease and use agreements.
    Subd. 6. Enforceable financial commitments. The authority must determine before stadium
construction begins that all public and private funding sources for construction, operating expenses,
and capital improvements and repairs of the stadium are included in written agreements. The
committed funds must be adequate to design, construct, furnish, and equip the stadium, and pay
projected operating expenses and the costs of capital improvements and repairs during the term
of the lease or use agreement with the NFL team. The NFL team must provide the authority
access to NFL team financial or other information, which the authority deems necessary for
6020                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [107TH DAY

such determination. Any financial information obtained by the authority under this subdivision is
nonpublic data under section 13.02, subdivision 9.
   Subd. 7. Environmental requirements. The authority must comply with all environmental
requirements imposed by regulatory agencies for the stadium, site, and structure, except as provided
by section 473J.09, subdivision 11, or by section 473J.17.
    Subd. 8. Public share on sale of NFL team. The lease or use agreement must provide that,
if the NFL team is sold or an interest in the NFL team is sold after the effective date of this
chapter, a portion of the sale price must be paid to the authority and deposited in a reserve fund
for improvements to the stadium or expended as the authority may otherwise direct. The portion
required to be so paid to the authority is 18 percent of the amount in excess of the purchase price
of the NFL team by the selling owner or owners, declining to zero 15 years after commencement
of stadium construction in increments of 1.2 percent each year. The agreement must provide
exceptions for sales to members of the owners' family and entities and trusts beneficially owned by
family members, sales to employees of equity interests aggregating up to ten percent, sales related
to capital infusions not distributed to the owners, and sales amongst existing owners not exceeding
20 percent equity interest in the NFL team.
    Subd. 9. Authority's access to NFL team financial information. A notice provision for a
material breach shall be agreed to between the authority and the NFL team. In the event there is a
material breach by the NFL team under the lease or use agreement, the lease or use agreement must
provide the authority access to audited financial statements of the NFL team and other financial
information that the authority deems necessary to enforce the terms of any lease or use agreements.
Any financial information obtained by the authority under this subdivision is nonpublic data under
section 13.02, subdivision 9.
    Subd. 10. NFL team name retained. The lease or use agreement must provide that the NFL
team and NFL will transfer to the state of Minnesota the Minnesota Vikings' heritage and records,
including the name, logo, colors, history, playing records, trophies, and memorabilia in the event of
relocation of the NFL team in violation of the lease or use agreement.
    Subd. 11. Stadium design. (a) The authority and the NFL team will build a stadium that
is environmentally and energy efficient and will make an effort to build a stadium that is
eligible to receive the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification
for environmental design, and to the extent practicable, will strive to make the stadium design
architecturally significant.
    (b) The stadium design must, to the extent feasible, follow sustainable building guidelines
established under section 16B.325.
   (c) The authority and the team must ensure that the stadium be, to the greatest extent practicable,
constructed of American-made steel.
    Subd. 12. Necessary approvals. The authority and the NFL team must secure any necessary
approvals to the terms of the lease and use agreement and the design and construction plans for the
stadium, including prior approval of the NFL.
   Subd. 13. Affordable access. The lease or use agreement must provide for an agreed-upon
number of affordable tickets to the professional sporting events held in the stadium.
107TH DAY]                          MONDAY, APRIL 23, 2012                                       6021

    Subd. 14. Stadium builder's licenses. The authority shall own and retain the exclusive right to
sell stadium builder's licenses in the stadium. The authority will retain the NFL team to act as the
authority's agent in marketing and selling such licenses.
    Subd. 15. Major league soccer. The authority shall, for five years after the first NFL team home
game is played in the stadium, grant the NFL team the exclusive right to establish major league
soccer at the stadium. The authority and the NFL team may enter into an agreement providing the
terms and conditions of such an arrangement, provided:
    (1) if any of the NFL team owners whose family owns at least three percent of the NFL team
purchases full or partial ownership in a major league soccer franchise, such franchise may play in the
stadium under a use agreement with similar terms as are applicable to the NFL team at no additional
rent, but including a provision of payment of game day costs and reasonable marginal costs incurred
by the authority as a result of the major league soccer team; and
  (2) capital improvements required by a major league soccer franchise must be financed by the
owners of the major league soccer team, unless otherwise agreed to by the authority.
    Subd. 16. NFL team-related entities. Subject to the prior approval of the authority, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, any of the obligations by the NFL team may be performed by the NFL
team, a related entity, or a third party, and the NFL team, any entity related to the NFL team or third
party may receive any revenues to which the NFL team is entitled hereunder; provided, however,
the NFL team shall remain liable if any obligations are assigned to a related entity or third party.
   Sec. 18. [473J.17] MUNICIPAL ACTIVITIES.
    Subdivision 1. Property acquisition and disposition. The city may, to the extent legally
permissible, acquire land, air rights, and other property interests within the development area
for the stadium site and stadium infrastructure and convey it to the authority with or without
consideration, prepare a site for development as a stadium, and acquire and construct any related
stadium infrastructure. To the extent property parcels or interests acquired are more extensive than
the stadium infrastructure requirements, the city may sell or otherwise dispose of the excess.
    Subd. 2. Claims. Except as may be mutually agreed to by the city and the authority, the city has
no interest in or claim to any assets or revenues of the authority.
    Subd. 3. Environmental; planning and zoning. The authority is the responsible governmental
unit for an environmental impact statement for the stadium prepared under section 116D.04, if an
environmental impact statement is necessary. Notwithstanding section 116D.04, subdivision 2b,
and implementing rules: (1) the environmental impact statement shall not be required to consider
alternative stadium sites; and (2) the environmental impact statement must be determined to be
adequate before commencing work on the foundation of the stadium, but the stadium and stadium
infrastructure may otherwise be started and all preliminary and final government decisions and
actions may be made and taken including, but not limited to, acquiring land; obtaining financing;
granting permits or other land use approvals; entering into grant, lease, or use agreements; or
preparing the site or related stadium infrastructure prior to a determination of the adequacy of the
environmental impact statement.
   Subd. 4. Local government expenditure. The city may make expenditures or grants for other
costs incidental and necessary to further the purposes of this chapter and may, by agreement,
6022                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [107TH DAY

reimburse in whole or in part, any entity that has granted, loaned, or advanced funds to the city to
further the purposes of this chapter. The city may reimburse the authority or a local governmental
entity or make a grant to the authority or such a governmental unit or be reimbursed by the authority
or local government entity for site acquisition, preparation of the site for stadium development,
and stadium infrastructure.
    Subd. 5. Municipal authority. The legislature intends that, except as expressly limited herein,
the city may acquire and develop stadium infrastructure, enter into contracts with the authority
and other governmental or nongovernmental entities, appropriate funds, and make employees,
consultants, and other revenues available for those purposes.
     Subd. 6. Stadium Implementation Committee; city review. In order to accomplish the
objectives of this act within the required time frame, it is necessary to establish an alternative
process for municipal land use and development review. It is hereby found and declared that
the construction of a stadium within the development area is consistent with the adopted area
plan, is the preferred stadium location, and is a permitted land use. This subdivision establishes a
procedure for all land use and development reviews and approvals by the city of Minneapolis for
the stadium and related stadium infrastructure and supersedes all land use and development rules
and restrictions and procedures imposed by other law, charter, or ordinance, including without
limitation section 15.99. No later than 30 days after timely compliance of the city as provided in
article 4, section 4, of this chapter, the city of Minneapolis shall establish a stadium implementation
committee to make recommendations on the design plans submitted for the stadium, and stadium
infrastructure, and related improvements. The implementation committee must take action to issue
its recommendations within the time frames established in the planning and construction timetable
issued by the authority which shall provide for no less than 60 days for the committee's review. The
recommendations of the implementation committee shall be forwarded to the city of Minneapolis
Planning Commission for an advisory recommendation and then to the city council for final action
in a single resolution, which final action must be taken within 45 days of the submission of the
recommendations to the planning commission. The city council shall not impose any unreasonable
conditions on the recommendations of the implementation committee, nor take any action or
impose any conditions that will result in delay from the time frames established in the planning
and construction timetable or in additional overall costs. Failure of the city council to act within
the 45-day period shall be deemed to be approval. The authority may seek de novo review in the
district court of any city council action. The district court or any appellate court shall expedite
review to the maximum extent possible and timely issue relief, orders, or opinions as necessary to
give effect to the provisions and objectives in this act.
   Sec. 19. [473J.19] PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION; SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
    Any real or personal property acquired, owned, leased, controlled, used, or occupied by the
authority for any of the purposes of this chapter, is acquired, owned, leased, controlled, used, and
occupied for public, governmental, and municipal purposes. The stadium and stadium infrastructure
are exempt from ad valorem taxation by the state or any political subdivision of the state provided
that the properties are subject to special assessments levied by a political subdivision for a local
improvement in amounts proportionate to and not exceeding the special benefit received by the
properties from the improvement. No possible use of any of the properties in any manner different
from their use under this chapter may be considered in determining the special benefit received by
the properties. Notwithstanding section 272.01, subdivision 2, or 273.19, real or personal property,
107TH DAY]                          MONDAY, APRIL 23, 2012                                         6023

which is subject to a lease or use agreement between the authority and another person for uses related
to the purposes of this chapter, including the operation of the stadium and related parking facilities,
is exempt from taxation regardless of the length of the lease or use agreement or the characteristics
of the entity leasing or using the property. This section, insofar as it provides an exemption or special
treatment, does not apply to any real property that is leased for residential, business, or commercial
development or to a restaurant that is open for general business more than 200 days a year, or other
purposes different from those contemplated in this chapter.
   Sec. 20. [473J.23] LOCAL TAXES.
    No new or additional local sales or use tax shall be imposed on sales at the stadium site unless the
tax is applicable throughout the taxing jurisdiction. No new or additional local tax shall be imposed
on sales of tickets and admissions to NFL team, NFL team owned major league soccer, or other team
related events at the stadium, notwithstanding any law or ordinance, unless the tax is applicable
throughout the taxing jurisdiction. The admissions and amusements tax currently imposed by the
city of Minneapolis pursuant to Laws 1969, chapter 1092, may apply to admissions for football and
NFL team related events, including NFL team owned major league soccer, as provided in section
473J.15, subdivision 15, at the stadium.
   Sec. 21. [473J.25] METROPOLITAN SPORTS FACILITIES COMMISSION ASSETS;
LIABILITIES TO AUTHORITY.

the operating expenses of the authority including salaries, compensation, and other personnel, office,
equipment, consultant and any other costs, until the commission is abolished pursuant to subdivision
3.

Facilities Commission shall pay its outstanding obligations, settle its accounts, and transfer its

    Subd. 3. Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission abolished; interim powers conferred
on authority. Upon transfer to the authority of all remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations of
the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, in subdivision 2, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities
Commission is abolished. When the remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations of the Metropolitan
Sports Facilities Commission have been transferred to the authority and the commission has been
abolished, the powers and duties of the commission under sections 473.551 to 473.599, and any
other law shall devolve upon the authority, in addition to the powers and duties of the authority
under this chapter, until the first NFL home game is played at the stadium.
    Subd. 4. Employees. Upon transfer of ownership all persons employed by the Metropolitan
Sports Facilities Commission shall be transferred to the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority
without loss of right or privilege. Nothing in this section shall be construed to give any such person
the right or privilege to continue in the same level or classification of employment previously held.
The Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority may assign any such person to an employment level and
classification which it deems appropriate and desirable in accordance with its personnel code.
   Sec. 22. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Except as otherwise provided, this article is effective the day following final enactment.

                                  STATE STADIUM FUNDING

    (b) Appropriation bonds may be sold and issued in amounts that, in the opinion of the
commissioner, are necessary to provide sufficient funds, not to exceed $548,000,000 net of costs of
issuance, deposits for debt service reserve funds, and costs of credit enhancement for achieving the
purposes authorized as provided under paragraph (a), and pay debt service, pay costs of issuance,
make deposits to reserve funds, pay the costs of credit enhancement, or make payments under other
agreements entered into under paragraph (d); provided, however, that appropriation bonds issued

    (c) Appropriation bonds may be issued from time to time in one or more series on the terms and

income of the owners for federal income tax purposes.
    (d) At the time of, or in anticipation of, issuing the appropriation bonds, and at any time
thereafter, so long as the appropriation bonds are outstanding, the commissioner may enter into

    Subd. 3. Form; procedure. (a) Appropriation bonds may be issued in the form of bonds, notes,

    (b) Every appropriation bond shall include a conspicuous statement of the limitation established

percentage of par value. Any bid received may be rejected.
   (d) Appropriation bonds must bear interest at a fixed or variable rate.
   (e) Notwithstanding any other law, appropriation bonds issued under this section shall be fully
negotiable.
    Subd. 4. Refunding bonds. The commissioner from time to time may issue appropriation bonds
for the purpose of refunding any appropriation bonds then outstanding, including the payment of
any redemption premiums on the bonds, any interest accrued or to accrue to the redemption date,
and costs related to the issuance and sale of the refunding bonds. The proceeds of any refunding
bonds may, in the discretion of the commissioner, be applied to the purchase or payment at maturity
of the appropriation bonds to be refunded, to the redemption of the outstanding appropriation bonds
on any redemption date, or to pay interest on the refunding bonds and may, pending application, be
placed in escrow to be applied to the purchase, payment, retirement, or redemption. Any escrowed
proceeds, pending such use, may be invested and reinvested in obligations that are authorized
investments under section 11A.24. The income earned or realized on the investment may also be
applied to the payment of the appropriation bonds to be refunded or interest or premiums on the
refunded appropriation bonds, or to pay interest on the refunding bonds. After the terms of the
escrow have been fully satisfied, any balance of the proceeds and any investment income may be
returned to the general fund or, if applicable, the special appropriation stadium bond proceeds fund
for use in any lawful manner. All refunding bonds issued under this subdivision must be prepared,

appropriation bonds are not public debt of the state, and the full faith, credit, and taxing powers of
the state are not pledged to the payment of the appropriation bonds or to any payment that the state
agrees to make under this section. Appropriation bonds shall not be obligations paid directly, in
whole or in part, from a tax of statewide application on any class of property, income, transaction,
or privilege. Appropriation bonds shall be payable in each fiscal year only from amounts that the
legislature may appropriate for debt service for any fiscal year, provided that nothing in this section
shall be construed to require the state to appropriate funds sufficient to make debt service payments
with respect to the appropriation bonds in any fiscal year. Appropriation bonds shall be canceled
and shall no longer be outstanding on the earlier of (1) the first day of a fiscal year for which the

year, the commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of revenue, shall determine the
estimated increase in revenues received from taxes imposed under chapter 297E over the estimated
revenues under the February 2012 revenue forecast for that fiscal year. For fiscal years after fiscal
year 2015, the commissioner shall use the February 2012 revenue forecast for fiscal year 2015 as
the baseline. All calculations under this paragraph must be made net of estimated refunds of the
taxes required to be paid.

   (d) The provisions of this subdivision apply only after the issuance of appropriation bonds under
subdivision 2.
    Subd. 9. Appropriation for debt service and other purposes. (a) The amount needed to pay
principal and interest on appropriation bonds issued under this section is appropriated each year
from the general fund to the commissioner, subject to repeal, unallotment under section 16A.152,
or cancellation otherwise pursuant to subdivision 6, for deposit into the bond payment accounts
established for such purpose in the special appropriation stadium bond proceeds fund.
   (b) To the extent the commissioner determines revenues are available under the provisions of
subdivision 8, paragraph (b), for the fiscal year, the following amounts are appropriated from the

by order of the commissioner; and
    (2) to the extent not required under clause (1), for deposit to any general reserve account
established by order of the commissioner for application against any shortfall in the amounts

proceeds resulting from the surcharge each year and shall annually remit that amount to pay for
bond debt service, notwithstanding the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 16A.965.
The commissioner may charge a reasonable amount necessary for the calculation, collection, and
remittance of the surcharge proceeds. The authority to impose the surcharge expires the day after
all stadium bonds, including fees and interest, have been paid.
   Sec. 3. APPROPRIATION.
    (a) $6,000,000 plus an amount calculated in paragraph (c) is annually appropriated from the

in no case may the rate exceed one-half of one percent.
    Subd. 2. Enforcement; collection. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), these taxes shall
be subject to the same interest penalties and other rules imposed under Minnesota Statutes, chapter
297A. The commissioner of revenue may enter into appropriate agreements with the city to provide
for collection of these taxes by the state on behalf of the city. The commissioner may charge the city
a reasonable fee for its collection from the proceeds of any taxes, as provided in Minnesota Statutes,
section 297A.99, subdivision 9.
    (b) A taxpayer located outside of the city of Minneapolis who collects use tax under this section
in an amount that does not exceed $10 in a reporting period is not required to remit that tax until the
amount of use tax collected is $10.
    Subd. 3. Use of property. (a) From the revenues collected by the commissioner of revenue
from the taxes levied under subdivision 1 or section 5, the commissioner of revenue shall apply
the tax proceeds as follows, notwithstanding the limitations provided in Minnesota Statutes, section
297A.99, subdivision 11, on the use of proceeds:
    (1) the commissioner must deduct the costs of collecting and administering the taxes, according
to the applicable state laws and agreements between the commissioner of revenue and the city. For
the taxes imposed under subdivision 1, the commissioner of revenue must deduct a proportionate
share of the cost of collection as described in Minnesota Statutes, section 297A.99, subdivision 11;
   (2) after deducting the costs in clause (1), the commissioner of revenue must deduct refunds of
any of these taxes due to taxpayers, if any;
    (3) after making the deductions provided in clause (2), notwithstanding the provisions of any
agreement between the commissioner of revenue and the city providing for collection and remittance
of these taxes, the commissioner of revenue must deposit to the general fund the amounts specified
in paragraph (b); and
     (4) after depositing to the general fund under clause (3) as specified in paragraph (b), the
commissioner of revenue must remit the remainder to the city for the uses specified in paragraph
(c).
   (b) The commissioner of revenue must deposit to the general fund the following amounts, as
required by paragraph (a), clause (3):
   (1) for state bond debt service support beginning in calendar year 2021, and for each calendar
year thereafter through calendar year 2046, proportionate amounts periodically so that not later than
December 31, 2046, an aggregate annual amount equal to a present value of $150,000,000 shall
have been deposited in the general fund. To determine aggregate present value, the commissioner

of revenue must consult with the commissioner of management and budget regarding the present
value dates, discount rate or rates, and schedules of annual amounts. The present value date or dates
must be based on the date or dates bonds are sold under Minnesota Statutes, section 16A.965, or
the date or dates other state funds, if any, are deposited into the construction fund. The discount
rate or rates must be based on the all in true interest cost of the bonds issued under Minnesota
Statutes, section 16A.965, or equivalent 30-year bond index, as determined by the commissioner of
management and budget. The schedule of annual amounts must be certified to the commissioner of
revenue by the commissioner of management and budget and the finance officer of the city;
    (2) for the capital improvement reserve appropriation to stadium authority beginning in calendar
year 2021, and for each calendar year thereafter through calendar year 2046, so that not later than
January 1, 2022, and as of January 1 of each following year, an aggregate annual amount equal
to the amount paid by the state for calendar year 2021, under Minnesota Statutes, section 473J.13,
subdivision 4, increased each year by an annual adjustment factor shall have been deposited in the
general fund;
    (3) for the operating expense appropriation to stadium authority beginning in calendar year 2021,
and for each calendar year thereafter through calendar year 2046, so that not later than January 1,
2022, and as of January 1 of each following year, an aggregate annual amount equal to the amount
paid by the state for calendar year 2021 under Minnesota Statutes, section 473J.13, subdivision 2,
increased each year by an annual adjustment factor shall have been deposited in the general fund;
    (4) for recapture of state advances for capital improvements and operating expenses for calendar
years 2016 through 2020 beginning in calendar year 2021, and for each calendar year thereafter
until all amounts under this clause have been paid, proportionate amounts periodically shall be
deposited to the general fund so that an aggregate amount equal to the present value of all amounts
granted to the authority under article 2, section 2, paragraphs (a) and (b), shall have been deposited
in the general fund. To determine the present value of the amounts granted to the authority and
the present value of amounts deposited to the general fund under this clause, the commissioner
of revenue shall consult with the commissioner of management and budget regarding the present
value dates, discount rate or rates, and schedule of annual amounts. The present value dates shall
be based on the dates state funds are paid to the authority, or the dates the commissioner of revenue
deposits taxes for purposes of this clause to the general fund. The discount rates must be based on
the reasonably equivalent cost of state funds as determined by the commissioner of management
and budget. The schedule of annual amounts must be revised to reflect amounts paid under article
2, section 2, paragraphs (a) and (b), and taxes deposited to the general fund from time to time under
this clause, and the schedule and revised schedules must be certified to the commissioner of revenue
by the commissioner of management and budget and the finance officer of the city; and
    (5) to capture increases in taxes imposed under subdivision 1 and section 5, for the benefit of the
stadium authority, beginning in calendar year 2013 and for each calendar year thereafter through
2046, there shall be deposited to the general fund by February 15 of each following year, amounts
calculated by the commissioner of revenue under this clause. For each year, the commissioner of
revenue shall determine the excess, if any, of these taxes received by the commissioner of revenue
over the benchmark scheduled amounts of these taxes, as described in this section. The benchmark
scheduled amounts for each year shall be based on the actual amount of these taxes for calendar
year 2011 inflated for each subsequent year at an annual rate of two percent, according to a schedule
certified to the commissioner of revenue by the commissioner of management and budget and the

finance officer of the city. The amounts to be deposited to the general fund by the commissioner of
revenue for each year shall be:
    (i) zero for the amount of these taxes for the year up to a scheduled benchmark of $1,000,000,
inflated at two percent per year, in excess of the taxes for calendar year 2011;
    (ii) 50 percent times the difference, if any, by which the amount of these taxes for the year exceeds
the scheduled benchmark in clause (i), as inflated, but not greater than a scheduled benchmark of
$3,000,000, inflated at two percent per year, in excess of the taxes for calendar year 2011; and
    (iii) 25 percent times the difference, if any, by which the amount of these taxes for the year
exceeds the scheduled benchmark of $3,000,000, inflated at two percent per year, in excess of the
taxes for calendar year 2011.
    (c) The annual adjustment factor for purposes of this section and section .. for any year shall be
equal to the increase, if any, in the amount of these taxes received by the commissioner of revenue
in the preceding year over the amount received in the year prior to the preceding year, expressed
as a percentage of the amount received in the year prior to the preceding year; provided, that the
adjustment factor for any year shall not be less than zero percent nor more than five percent.
    (d) After application of taxes collected by the commissioner of revenue as provided in paragraphs
(a), clauses (1) to (3); and (b), revenues received from the tax may only be used:

    (b) The board, or the director if authorized by the board, may require the deactivation of an

necessary to ensure and maintain the integrity of electronic bingo devices and the electronic bingo
games played on the devices.
     Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.151, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4d. Electronic pull-tab devices and electronic pull-tab game system. (a) The board may
adopt rules it deems necessary to ensure the integrity of electronic pull-tab devices, the electronic
pull-tab games played on the devices, and the electronic pull-tab game system necessary to operate
them.
     (b) The board may not require an organization to use electronic pull-tab devices.
    (c) Before authorizing the lease or sale of electronic pull-tab devices and the electronic
pull-tab game system, the board shall examine electronic pull-tab devices allowed under section
349.12, subdivision 12b. The board may contract for the examination of the game system and
electronic pull-tab devices and may require a working model to be transported to locations the
board designates for testing, examination, and analysis. The manufacturer must pay all costs of any
testing, examination, analysis, and transportation of the model. The system must be approved by

resale or lease, be unloaded into a storage facility located in Minnesota which the distributor owns
or leases; and which has been registered, in advance and in writing, with the Division of Alcohol and
Gambling Enforcement as a storage facility of the distributor. All unregistered gambling equipment
and all unaffixed registration stamps owned by, or in the possession of, a licensed distributor in the
state of Minnesota shall be stored at a storage facility which has been registered with the Division of
Alcohol and Gambling Enforcement. No gambling equipment may be moved from the facility unless
the gambling equipment has been first registered with the board or the Department of Revenue. A
distributor must notify the board of the method that it will use to sell and transfer electronic pull-tab
games to licensed organizations, and must receive approval of the board before implementing or
making changes to the approved method.
    (b) Notwithstanding section 349.163, subdivisions 5, 6, and 8, a licensed manufacturer may

licensed manufacturer; and (2) registered, in advance and in writing, with the Division of Alcohol
and Gambling Enforcement as a manufacturer's storage facility. No gambling equipment may be
shipped into Minnesota to the manufacturer's registered storage facility unless the shipment of
the gambling equipment is reported to the Department of Revenue in a manner prescribed by the
department. No gambling equipment may be moved from the storage facility unless the gambling
equipment is sold to a licensed distributor and is otherwise in conformity with this chapter, is
shipped to an out-of-state site and the shipment is reported to the Department of Revenue in a
manner prescribed by the department, or is otherwise sold and shipped as permitted by board
rule. A manufacturer must notify the board of the method that it will use to sell and transfer
electronic pull-tab games to licensed distributors, and must receive approval of the board before
implementing or making changes to the approved method.
    (c) All storage facilities owned, leased, used, or operated by a licensed distributor or
manufacturer may be entered upon and inspected by the employees of the Division of Alcohol and
Gambling Enforcement, the Division of Alcohol and Gambling Enforcement director's authorized
representatives, employees of the Gambling Control Board or its authorized representatives,

hours. Obstruction of, or failure to permit, entry and inspection is cause for revocation or suspension
of a manufacturer's or distributor's licenses and permits issued under this chapter.
    (d) Unregistered gambling equipment found at any location in Minnesota other than the
manufacturing plant of a licensed manufacturer or a registered storage facility are contraband under
section 349.2125. This paragraph does not apply:
    (1) to unregistered gambling equipment being transported in interstate commerce between
locations outside this state, if the interstate shipment is verified by a bill of lading or other valid
shipping document; and
    (2) to gambling equipment registered with the Department of Revenue for distribution to the
tribal casinos.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.163, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. License required. No manufacturer of gambling equipment may sell any
gambling equipment to any person for use or resale within the state, unless the manufacturer has
a current and valid license issued by the board under this section and has satisfied other criteria
prescribed by the board by rule. A manufacturer licensed under this section may also be licensed
as a linked bingo game provider under section 349.1635.
    A manufacturer licensed under this section may not also be directly or indirectly licensed as a
distributor under section 349.161.
   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.163, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Paper pull-tab and tipboard flares. (a) A manufacturer may not ship or cause to be
shipped into this state or sell for use or resale in this state any deal of paper pull-tabs or tipboards
that does not have its own individual flare as required for that deal by this subdivision and rule of the
board. A person other than a manufacturer may not manufacture, alter, modify, or otherwise change
a flare for a deal of paper pull-tabs or tipboards except as allowed by this chapter or board rules.
    (b) The flare of each paper pull-tab and tipboard game must have affixed to or imprinted at the
bottom a bar code that provides all information required by the commissioner of revenue under
section 297E.04, subdivision 2.
    The serial number included in the bar code must be the same as the serial number of the tickets
included in the deal. A manufacturer who manufactures a deal of paper pull-tabs must affix to the
outside of the box containing that game the same bar code that is affixed to or imprinted at the
bottom of a flare for that deal.
    (c) No person may alter the bar code that appears on the outside of a box containing a deal of
paper pull-tabs and tipboards. Possession of a box containing a deal of paper pull-tabs and tipboards
that has a bar code different from the bar code of the deal inside the box is prima facie evidence that
the possessor has altered the bar code on the box.
    (d) The flare of each deal of paper pull-tabs and tipboards sold by a manufacturer for use or resale
in Minnesota must have imprinted on it a symbol that is at least one inch high and one inch wide
consisting of an outline of the geographic boundaries of Minnesota with the letters "MN" inside the
outline. The flare must be placed inside the wrapping of the deal which the flare describes.

    (e) Each paper pull-tab and tipboard flare must bear the following statement printed in letters
large enough to be clearly legible:
   "Pull-tab (or tipboard) purchasers ­ This pull-tab (or tipboard) game is not legal in Minnesota
unless:
   ­ an outline of Minnesota with letters "MN" inside it is imprinted on this sheet, and
   ­ the serial number imprinted on the bar code at the bottom of this sheet is the same as the serial
number on the pull-tab (or tipboard) ticket you have purchased."
   (f) The flare of each paper pull-tab and tipboard game must have the serial number of the game
imprinted on the bar code at the bottom of the flare in numerals at least one-half inch high.

subdivision, a manufacturer is also required to submit the applicable version of any software
necessary to operate electronic devices and related systems.
    (b) The board shall inspect and test all the equipment, including software and software upgrades,
it deems necessary to determine the equipment's compliance with law and board rules. Samples
required under this subdivision must be approved by the board before the equipment being sampled
is shipped into or sold for use or resale in this state. The board shall impose a fee of $25 for each item
of gambling equipment that the manufacturer submits for approval or for which the manufacturer
requests approval. The board shall impose a fee of $100 for each sample of gambling equipment
that it tests.
    (c) The board may require samples of gambling equipment to be tested by an independent testing
laboratory prior to submission to the board for approval. All costs of testing by an independent
testing laboratory must be borne by the manufacturer. An independent testing laboratory used by
a manufacturer to test samples of gambling equipment must be approved by the board before the
equipment is submitted to the laboratory for testing.
    (d) The board may request the assistance of the commissioner of public safety and the director
of the State Lottery in performing the tests.

     Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.19, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Pull-tab records. (a) The board shall by rule require a licensed organization to require
each winner of a paper pull-tab prize of $50 or more to present identification in the form of a driver's
license, Minnesota identification card, or other identification the board deems sufficient to allow the
identification and tracking of the winner. The rule must require the organization to retain winning
paper pull-tabs of $50 or more, and the identification of the winner of the pull-tab, for 3-1/2 years.
    (b) An organization must maintain separate cash banks for each deal of paper pull-tabs unless
(1) the licensed organization uses a pull-tab dispensing device, or (2) the organization uses a cash
register, of a type approved by the board, which records all sales of paper pull-tabs by separate deals.
     (c) The board shall:
    (1) by rule adopt minimum technical standards for cash registers that may be used by
organizations, and shall approve for use by organizations any cash register that meets the standards;
and

    (2) before allowing an organization to use a cash register that commingles receipts from several
different paper pull-tab games in play, adopt rules that define how cash registers may be used and
that establish a procedure for organizations to reconcile all pull-tab games in play at the end of each
month.

marking devices used in a municipality substantially an equal number of times in the first, last, and
in each intermediate place in the list or group in which they belong. However, the arrangement of
candidates' names must be the same on all voting systems used in the same precinct. If the number

municipality and the county auditor of a county in which a counting center serving more than
one municipality is located shall prepare a plan which indicates acquisition of sufficient facilities,
computer time, and professional services and which describes the proposed manner of complying
with section 206.80. The plan must be signed, notarized, and submitted to the secretary of state more
than 60 days before the first election at which the municipality uses an electronic voting system.
Before M ­­­ March 1 of each subsequent general election year, the clerk or auditor shall submit
          ay
to the secretary of state notification of any changes to the plan on file with the secretary of state.
The secretary of state shall review each plan for its sufficiency and may request technical assistance
from the Office of Enterprise Technology or other agency which may be operating as the central
computer authority. The secretary of state shall notify each reporting authority of the sufficiency or
insufficiency of its plan within 20 days of receipt of the plan. The attorney general, upon request of
the secretary of state, may seek a district court order requiring an election official to fulfill duties
imposed by this subdivision or by rules promulgated pursuant to this section.

    Subd. 15. Electronic transactions. (a) The commissioner may receive an application for, sell,
and issue any license, stamp, permit, pass, sticker, gift card, safety training certification, registration,
or transfer under the jurisdiction of the commissioner by electronic means, including by telephone.

Notwithstanding section 97A.472, electronic and telephone transactions may be made outside of
the state. The commissioner may:
    (1) provide for the electronic transfer of funds generated by electronic transactions, including
by telephone;
    (2) assign an identification number to an applicant who purchases a hunting or fishing license or
recreational vehicle registration by electronic means, to serve as temporary authorization to engage
in the activity requiring a license or registration until the license or registration is received or expires;
    (3) charge and permit agents to charge a fee of individuals who make electronic transactions and
transactions by telephone or Internet, including issuing fees and an additional transaction fee not to
exceed $3.50;
    (4) charge and permit agents to charge a convenience fee not to exceed three percent of the cost of
the license to individuals who use electronic bank cards for payment. An electronic licensing system
agent charging a fee of individuals making an electronic bank card transaction in person must post
a sign informing individuals of the fee. The sign must be near the point of payment, clearly visible,
include the amount of the fee, and state: "License agents are allowed by state law to charge a fee
not to exceed three percent of the cost of state licenses to persons who use electronic bank cards for
payment. The fee is not required by state law.";
    (5) establish, by written order, an electronic licensing system commission to be paid by revenues
generated from all sales made through the electronic licensing system. The commissioner shall
establish the commission in a manner that neither significantly overrecovers nor underrecovers costs
involved in providing the electronic licensing system; and
    (6) adopt rules to administer the provisions of this subdivision.
    (b) The fees established under paragraph (a), clauses (3) and (4), and the commission established
under paragraph (a), clause (5), are not subject to the rulemaking procedures of chapter 14 and
section 14.386 does not apply.
    (c) Money received from fees and commissions collected under this subdivision, including
interest earned, is annually appropriated from the game and fish fund and the natural resources
fund to the commissioner for the cost of electronic licensing.
    (d) Game and fish licenses under chapters 97A, 97B, and 97C shall be available by electronic
transaction, regardless of whether all or any part of the biennial appropriation law for the
department has been enacted. If, by July 1 of an odd-numbered year, legislation has not been
enacted to appropriate money to the commissioner of management and budget for central
accounting, procurement, payroll, and human resources functions, amounts necessary to operate
those functions for the purpose of this paragraph are appropriated from the general fund to the
commissioner of management and budget. As necessary, the commissioner may transfer a portion
of this appropriation to other state agencies to support carrying out these functions. Any subsequent
appropriation to the commissioner of management and budget for a biennium in which this section
is applicable supersedes and replaces the funding authorized in this paragraph. This paragraph may
be cited as the "Freedom to Hunt and Fish Act of 2012.""

               ­­. A containment facility for the purposes of this section applies to live minnows
imported for later export and does not need to comply with section 17.4982, subdivision 8, clause
(4). The permit shall include conditions necessary to avoid spreading aquatic invasive species
and fish pathogens. Permits shall not be issued to containment facilities located within a 25-year
floodplain.
    (b) Transport under this subdivision must occur in a container that has been tagged upon entering
the state and upon leaving the approved facility. Tag numbers must be listed on both the bill of lading
used for transport and on the records required in paragraph (e). Water used for transport must be
groundwater or well water, not surface water. The permittee must notify Department of Natural
Resources enforcement at least 12 hours prior to exercising an import for later export permit. The
following paperwork must accompany the shipment:
     (1) a valid import for later export permit; and
    (2) a valid fish health certification from the source waterbody showing no record of viral
hemorrhagic septicemia, or any other isolated replicating virus, for species on the official list of
viral hemorrhagic septicemia susceptible species published by the United States Department of
Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services.
   (c) Live minnows imported under this subdivision may only be approved for holding in indoor
tanks, raceways, or rearing troughs listed on a private fish hatchery license under section 17.4984,
subdivision 2, which do not discharge directly into waters of the state, and may not be sold live within
Minnesota. Imported minnows must be kept separate from minnows originating in Minnesota.
    ­
    (b
     ­­) (d) An applicant for a permit under this subdivision shall submit to the commissioner
sufficient information to identify potential threats to native plant and animal species and an
evaluation of the feasibility of the proposal. The permit may include reasonable restrictions on
importation, transportation, possession, containment, disease certification, and disposal of minnows
to ensure that native species are protected. The permit may have a term of up to two years and

may be modified, suspended, or revoked by the commissioner for cause, including violation of a
condition of the permit.
    (e) A commercial licensee importing live minnows under this subdivision must maintain records
on forms provided by the commissioner for each load of minnows imported and later exported. The
records must include the number and species of minnows imported and subsequently exported, the
dates of import and export, and other information as specified on the reporting form. The commercial
licensee must enter required records onto forms within 24 hours of import and export, and must
retain records for three years following the year of creation. All records required to be retained must
be open to inspection by the commissioner at any reasonable time. Copies of the records shall be
submitted to the commissioner each month even if no live minnow import or export activity took
place.
    (f) The premises, property, vehicles, private aquatic life, and equipment that are part of a
containment facility permitted under this subdivision are subject to reasonable and necessary
inspections at reasonable times by a person delegated by the commissioner. The owner, operator, or
designee may be present when inspections are conducted. During the inspection, a representative
sample of imported minnows may be collected for the purpose of fish pathogen or invasive species
screening.
    (g) The commissioner may require the applicant to furnish evidence of financial responsibility
in the form of a surety bond or other financial assurance payable to the commissioner in the amount
of $1,000,000 should the permittee be convicted of introducing an invasive species or pathogen into
waters of the state."

parent or guardian is not living within the state; or (3) the parent or guardian having legal custody
of the child is an inmate of a Minnesota correctional facility or is a resident of a halfway house
under the supervision of the commissioner of corrections. If any of clauses (1) to (3) apply, the
school district of residence shall be the school district in which the pupil resided when the qualifying
event occurred. If no other district of residence can be established, the school district of residence
shall be the school district in which the pupil currently resides. If there is a dispute between school
districts regarding residency, the district of residence is the district designated by the commissioner
of education.
    (c) The serving district is responsible for transporting a homeless pupil to and from the pupil's
district of residence. The district may transport from a permanent home in another district but only
through the end of the academic school year. When a pupil is enrolled in a charter school, the district
or school that provides transportation for other pupils enrolled in the charter school is responsible
for providing transportation. When a homeless student with or without an individualized education
program attends a public school other than an independent or special school district or charter school,
the district of residence is responsible for transportation.

    Subd. 3. Alternative attendance programs. (a) A district that enrolls nonresident pupils in
programs under sections 123A.05 to 123A.08, 124D.03, 124D.08, and 124D.68, must provide
authorized transportation to the pupil within the attendance area for the school that the pupil
attends at the same level of service that is provided to resident pupils within the attendance area.
The resident district need not provide or pay for transportation between the pupil's residence and
the district's border.
    (b) A district may provide transportation to allow a student who attends a high-need English
language learner program and who resides within the transportation attendance area of the program
to continue in the program until the student completes the highest grade level offered by the program.
   (c) A homeless nonresident pupil enrolled under section 124D.08, subdivision 2a, must be
provided transportation from the pupil's district of residence to and from the school of enrollment.
     Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 124D.08, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

who has been enrolled in a district, who is identified as homeless, and whose parent or legal guardian
moves to another district, may continue to enroll in the nonresident district without the approval of
the board of the nonresident district. The approval of the board of the pupil's resident district is not
required.
     Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 124D.09, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment in reading as a condition of enrollment. A secondary pupil
may enroll in their first postsecondary options enrollment course under this subdivision. A student
who is refused enrollment by a Minnesota state college or university under this subdivision, may
apply to an eligible institution offering a career or technical education course. The postsecondary
institution must give priority to its students according to subdivision 9. If a secondary student
receives a grade of "C" or better in the career or technical education course taken under this
subdivision, the postsecondary institution must allow the student to take additional postsecondary
courses for secondary credit at that institution, not to exceed the limits in subdivision 8. A "career
or technical course" is a course that is part of a career and technical education program that
provides individuals with coherent, rigorous content aligned with academic standards and relevant
technical knowledge and skills needed to prepare for further education and careers in current and
emerging professions and provide technical skill proficiency, an industry recognized credential,
and a certificate, diploma, or an associate degree.

section.
    A district shall grant academic credit to a pupil enrolled in a course for secondary credit if the
pupil successfully completes the course. Seven quarter or four semester college credits equal at
least one full year of high school credit. Fewer college credits may be prorated. A district must also
grant academic credit to a pupil enrolled in a course for postsecondary credit if secondary credit is
requested by a pupil. If no comparable course is offered by the district, the district must, as soon as
possible, notify the commissioner, who shall determine the number of credits that shall be granted
to a pupil who successfully completes a course. If a comparable course is offered by the district, the

school board shall grant a comparable number of credits to the pupil. If there is a dispute between
the district and the pupil regarding the number of credits granted for a particular course, the pupil
may appeal the board's decision to the commissioner. The commissioner's decision regarding the
number of credits shall be final.
    The secondary credits granted to a pupil must be counted toward the graduation requirements
and subject area requirements of the district. Evidence of successful completion of each course and
secondary credits granted must be included in the pupil's secondary school record. A pupil shall
provide the school with a copy of the pupil's grade in each course taken for secondary credit under
this section. Upon the request of a pupil, the pupil's secondary school record must also include
evidence of successful completion and credits granted for a course taken for postsecondary credit.
In either case, the record must indicate that the credits were earned at a postsecondary institution.
    If a pupil enrolls in a postsecondary institution after leaving secondary school, the postsecondary
institution must award postsecondary credit for any course successfully completed for secondary
credit at that institution. Other postsecondary institutions may award, after a pupil leaves secondary
school, postsecondary credit for any courses successfully completed under this section. An
institution may not charge a pupil for the award of credit.
    The Board of Trustees of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities and the Board of
Regents of the University of Minnesota must, and private nonprofit and proprietary postsecondary
institutions should, award postsecondary credit for any successfully completed courses in a program
certified by the National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships offered according to an
agreement under subdivision 10.
   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 124D.09, subdivision 22, is amended to read:
    Subd. 22. Transportation. (a) A parent or guardian of a pupil enrolled in a course for
secondary credit may apply to the pupil's district of residence for reimbursement for transporting
the pupil between the secondary school in which the pupil is enrolled or the pupil's home and the
postsecondary institution that the pupil attends. The state shall provide state aid to a district in an
amount sufficient to reimburse the parent or guardian for the necessary transportation costs when
the family's or guardian's income is at or below the poverty level, as determined by the federal
government. The reimbursement shall be the pupil's actual cost of transportation or 15 cents per
mile traveled, whichever is less. Reimbursement may not be paid for more than 250 miles per week.
However, if the nearest postsecondary institution is more than 25 miles from the pupil's resident
secondary school, the weekly reimbursement may not exceed the reimbursement rate per mile times
the actual distance between the secondary school or the pupil's home and the nearest postsecondary
institution times ten. The state must pay aid to the district according to this subdivision.
    (b) A parent or guardian of an alternative pupil enrolled in a course for secondary credit may
apply to the pupil's postsecondary institution for reimbursement for transporting the pupil between
the secondary school in which the pupil is enrolled or the pupil's home and the postsecondary
institution in an amount sufficient to reimburse the parent or guardian for the necessary
transportation costs when the family's or guardian's income is at or below the poverty level, as
determined by the federal government. The amount of the reimbursement shall be determined as in
paragraph (a). The state must pay aid to the postsecondary institution according to this subdivision.

    Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 471.975, is amended to read:
    471.975 MAY PAY DIFFERENTIAL OF RESERVE ON ACTIVE DUTY.
    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a statutory or home rule charter city, county, town, or
other political subdivision may pay to each eligible member of the National Guard or other reserve
component of the armed forces of the United States an amount equal to the difference between the
member's base active duty military salary and the salary the member would be paid as an active
political subdivision employee, including any adjustments the member would have received if not
on leave of absence. This payment may be made only to a person whose base active duty military
salary is less than the salary the person would be paid as an active political subdivision employee.
Back pay authorized by this section may be paid in a lump sum. Payment under this section must not
extend beyond four years from the date the employee reported for active service, plus any additional
time the employee may be legally required to serve.

                                                        , Each school district shall pay to each eligible
member of the National Guard or other reserve component of the armed forces of the United States
an amount equal to the difference between the member's base active duty military salary and the
salary the member would be paid as an active school district employee, including any adjustments
the member would have received if not on leave of absence. The pay differential must be based on
a comparison between the member's daily base rate of active duty pay, calculated by dividing the
member's base military monthly salary by the number of paid days in the month, and the member's
daily rate of pay for the member's school district salary, calculated by dividing the member's total
school district salary by the number of contract days. The member's salary as a school district
employee must include the member's basic salary and any additional salary the member earns from
the school district for cocurricular and extracurricular activities. The differential payment under this
paragraph must be the difference between the daily base rates of military pay times the number of
school district contract days the member misses because of military active duty. This payment may
be made only to a person whose daily base rate of active duty pay is less than the person's daily
rate of pay as an active school district employee. Payments may be made at the intervals at which

the member received pay as a school district employee. Payment under this section must not extend
beyond four years from the date the employee reported for active service, plus any additional time
the employee may be legally required to serve.
    (c) An eligible member of the reserve components of the armed forces of the United States is a
reservist or National Guard member who was an employee of a political subdivision at the time the
member reported for active service on or after May 29, 2003, or who is on active service on May
29, 2003.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) and elsewhere in Minnesota Statutes, a statutory or home
rule charter city, county, town, or other political subdivision has total discretion regarding employee
benefit continuation for a member who reports for active service and the terms and conditions of
any benefit.
    (e) A school district must continue the employee's enrollment in health and dental coverage, and
the employer contribution toward that coverage, until the employee is covered by health and dental
coverage provided by the armed forces. If the employee had elected dependent coverage for health
or dental coverage as of the time that the employee reported for active service, a school district must
offer the employee the option to continue the dependent coverage at the employee's own expense.
A school district must permit the employee to continue participating in any pretax account in which
the employee participated when the employee reported for active service, to the extent of employee
pay available for that purpose.
   (f) For purposes of this section, "active service" has the meaning given in section 190.05,
subdivision 5, but excludes service performed exclusively for purposes of:
   (1) basic combat training, advanced individual training, annual training, and periodic inactive
duty training;
     (2) special training periodically made available to reserve members; and
     (3) service performed in accordance with section 190.08, subdivision 3.

    (b
     ­­) Critical to schools' educational success is ongoing advanced placement/international
baccalaureate-approved teacher training. A secondary teacher assigned by a district to teach
an advanced placement or international baccalaureate course or other interested educator may
participate in a training program offered by The College Board or International Baccalaureate
North America, Inc. The state may pay a portion of the tuition, room, board, and out-of-state
travel costs a teacher or other interested educator incurs in participating in a training program.
The commissioner shall determine application procedures and deadlines, select teachers and other
interested educators to participate in the training program, and determine the payment process
and amount of the subsidy. The procedures determined by the commissioner shall, to the extent
possible, ensure that advanced placement and international baccalaureate courses become available
in all parts of the state and that a variety of course offerings are available in school districts. This
subdivision does not prevent teacher or other interested educator participation in training programs
offered by The College Board or International Baccalaureate North America, Inc., when tuition
is paid by a source other than the state.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 120B.30, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Statewide testing. (a) The commissioner, with advice from experts with
appropriate technical qualifications and experience and stakeholders, consistent with subdivision
1a, shall include in the comprehensive assessment system, for each grade level to be tested,
state-constructed tests developed from and aligned with the state's required academic standards
under section 120B.021, include multiple choice questions, and be administered annually to all
students in grades 3 through 8. State-developed high school tests aligned with the state's required
academic standards under section 120B.021 and administered to all high school students in a
subject other than writing must include multiple choice questions. The commissioner shall establish

one or more months during which schools shall administer the tests to students each school year.
For students enrolled in grade 8 before the 2005-2006 school year, Minnesota basic skills tests
in reading, mathematics, and writing shall fulfill students' basic skills testing requirements for
a passing state notation. The passing scores of basic skills tests in reading and mathematics are
the equivalent of 75 percent correct for students entering grade 9 based on the first uniform test
administered in February 1998. Students who have not successfully passed a Minnesota basic skills
test by the end of the 2011-2012 school year must pass the graduation-required assessments for
diploma under paragraph (c), except that for the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 school years only, these
students may satisfy the state's graduation test requirement for math by complying with paragraph
(d), clauses (1) and (3).
    (b) The state assessment system must be aligned to the most recent revision of academic
standards as described in section 120B.023 in the following manner:
      (1) mathematics;
      (i) grades 3 through 8 beginning in the 2010-2011 school year; and
      (ii) high school level beginning in the 2013-2014 school year;
      (2) science; grades 5 and 8 and at the high school level beginning in the 2011-2012 school year;
and
   (3) language arts and reading; grades 3 through 8 and high school level beginning in the
2012-2013 school year.
    (c) For students enrolled in grade 8 in the 2005-2006 school year and later, only the following
options shall fulfill students' state graduation test requirements:
      (1) for reading and mathematics:
    (i) obtaining an achievement level equivalent to or greater than proficient as determined through
a standard setting process on the Minnesota comprehensive assessments in grade 10 for reading
and grade 11 for mathematics or achieving a passing score as determined through a standard setting
process on the graduation-required assessment for diploma in grade 10 for reading and grade 11 for
mathematics or subsequent retests;
    (ii) achieving a passing score as determined through a standard setting process on the
state-identified language proficiency test in reading and the mathematics test for English language
learners or the graduation-required assessment for diploma equivalent of those assessments for
students designated as English language learners;
    (iii) achieving an individual passing score on the graduation-required assessment for diploma as
determined by appropriate state guidelines for students with an individualized education program
or 504 plan;
    (iv) obtaining achievement level equivalent to or greater than proficient as determined through
a standard setting process on the state-identified alternate assessment or assessments in grade 10 for
reading and grade 11 for mathematics for students with an individualized education program; or
    (v) achieving an individual passing score on the state-identified alternate assessment or
assessments as determined by appropriate state guidelines for students with an individualized

education program; and
   (2) for writing:
   (i) achieving a passing score on the graduation-required assessment for diploma;
    (ii) achieving a passing score as determined through a standard setting process on the
state-identified language proficiency test in writing for students designated as English language
learners;
    (iii) achieving an individual passing score on the graduation-required assessment for diploma as
determined by appropriate state guidelines for students with an individualized education program
or 504 plan; or
    (iv) achieving an individual passing score on the state-identified alternate assessment or
assessments as determined by appropriate state guidelines for students with an individualized
education program.
    (d) Students enrolled in grade 8 in any school year from the 2005-2006 school year to the
2009-2010 school year who do not pass the mathematics graduation-required assessment for
diploma under paragraph (c) are eligible to receive a high school diploma if they:
    (1) complete with a passing score or grade all state and local coursework and credits required
for graduation by the school board granting the students their diploma;
   (2) participate in district-prescribed academic remediation in mathematics; and
   (3) fully participate in at least two retests of the mathematics GRAD test or until they pass the
mathematics GRAD test, whichever comes first. A school, district, or charter school must place
on the high school transcript a student's current pass status for each subject that has a required
graduation assessment.
    In addition, the school board granting the students their diplomas may formally decide to
include a notation of high achievement on the high school diplomas of those graduating seniors
who, according to established school board criteria, demonstrate exemplary academic achievement
during high school.
    (e) The 3rd through 8th grade and high school test results shall be available to districts for
diagnostic purposes affecting student learning and district instruction and curriculum, and for
establishing educational accountability. The commissioner must disseminate to the public the high
school test results upon receiving those results.
    (f) The 3rd through 8th grade and high school tests must be aligned with state academic
standards. The commissioner shall determine the testing process and the order of administration.
The statewide results shall be aggregated at the site and district level, consistent with subdivision
1a.
   (g) In addition to the testing and reporting requirements under this section, the commissioner
shall include the following components in the statewide public reporting system:
    (1) uniform statewide testing of all students in grades 3 through 8 and at the high school level
that provides appropriate, technically sound accommodations or alternate assessments;

   (2) educational indicators that can be aggregated and compared across school districts and across
time on a statewide basis, including average daily attendance, high school graduation rates, and high
school drop-out rates by age and grade level;
   (3) state results on the American College Test; and
    (4) state results from participation in the National Assessment of Educational Progress so that
the state can benchmark its performance against the nation and other states, and, where possible,
against other countries, and contribute to the national effort to monitor achievement.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 122A.40, subdivision 5, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 5. Probationary period. (a) The first three consecutive years of a teacher's first teaching
experience in Minnesota in a single district is deemed to be a probationary period of employment,
and, the probationary period in each district in which the teacher is thereafter employed shall be one
year. The school board must adopt a plan for written evaluation of teachers during the probationary
period that is consistent with subdivision 8. Evaluation must occur at least three times periodically
throughout each school year for a teacher performing services during that school year; the first
evaluation must occur within the first 90 days of teaching service. Days devoted to parent-teacher
conferences, teachers' workshops, and other staff development opportunities and days on which
a teacher is absent from school must not be included in determining the number of school days
on which a teacher performs services. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), during the
probationary period any annual contract with any teacher may or may not be renewed as the school
board shall see fit. However, the board must give any such teacher whose contract it declines to
renew for the following school year written notice to that effect before ­  Ju
                                                                             ­n­­
                                                                                e July 1. If the teacher
requests reasons for any nonrenewal of a teaching contract, the board must give the teacher its reason
in writing, including a statement that appropriate supervision was furnished describing the nature
and the extent of such supervision furnished the teacher during the employment by the board, within
ten days after receiving such request. The school board may, after a hearing held upon due notice,
discharge a teacher during the probationary period for cause, effective immediately, under section
122A.44.
    (b) A board must discharge a probationary teacher, effective immediately, upon receipt of notice
under section 122A.20, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), that the teacher's license has been revoked due
to a conviction for child abuse or sexual abuse.
    (c) A probationary teacher whose first three years of consecutive employment are interrupted for
active military service and who promptly resumes teaching consistent with federal reemployment
timelines for uniformed service personnel under United States Code, title 38, section 4312(e), is
considered to have a consecutive teaching experience for purposes of paragraph (a).
    (d) A probationary teacher must complete at least 120 days of teaching service each year during
the probationary period. Days devoted to parent-teacher conferences, teachers' workshops, and other
staff development opportunities and days on which a teacher is absent from school do not count as
days of teaching service under this paragraph.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for the 2012-2013 school year and later.

    Subd. 13. Immediate discharge. (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), a board may
discharge a continuing-contract teacher, effective immediately, upon any of the following grounds:
   (1) immoral conduct, insubordination, or conviction of a felony;
    (2) conduct unbecoming a teacher which requires the immediate removal of the teacher from
classroom or other duties;
   (3) failure without justifiable cause to teach without first securing the written release of the school
board;
   (4) gross inefficiency which the teacher has failed to correct after reasonable written notice;
   (5) willful neglect of duty; or
   (6) continuing physical or mental disability subsequent to a 12 months leave of absence and
inability to qualify for reinstatement in accordance with subdivision 12.
   For purposes of this paragraph, conduct unbecoming a teacher includes an unfair discriminatory
practice described in section 363A.13.
    Prior to discharging a teacher under this paragraph, the board must notify the teacher in writing
and state its ground for the proposed discharge in reasonable detail. Within ten days after receipt
of this notification the teacher may make a written request for a hearing before the board and it
shall be granted before final action is taken. The board may, ­h­o­w ev
                                                                    ­­ ­­

                                ­ the hearing and determination of the issues raised in the hearing after
charges have been filed which constitute ground for discharge. If a teacher has been charged with a
felony and the underlying conduct that is the subject of the felony charge is a ground for a proposed
immediate discharge, the suspension pending the conclusion of the hearing and determination of the
issues may be without pay. If a hearing under this paragraph is held, the board must reimburse the
teacher for any salary or compensation withheld if the final decision of the board or the arbitrator
does not result in a penalty to or suspension, termination, or discharge of the teacher.
    (b) A board must discharge a continuing-contract teacher, effective immediately, upon receipt
of notice under section 122A.20, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), that the teacher's license has been
revoked due to a conviction for child abuse or sexual abuse.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

  123B.04 SITE DECISION-MAKING; INDIVIDUALIZED LEARNING AGREEMENT;
OTHER AGREEMENTS.
   Subdivision 1. Definition. "Education site" means a separate facility. A program within a facility
or within a district is an education site if the school board recognizes it as a site.
   Subd. 1a. Individualized learning and instruction; improved student achievement.
To promote individualized learning and instruction and improve student achievement under
subdivisions 4 and 4a, a participating school board under this section may consider how to:
   (1) assist a school site to adapt instruction to the needs and aptitudes of individual students,
107TH DAY]                         MONDAY, APRIL 23, 2012                                      6125

and establish goals and standards for individual students in addition to the state academic standards
applicable to all students;
    (2) coordinate the pace of instruction and learning with the needs and aptitudes of individual
students at a school site;
    (3) provide useful data and assist with research in developing and improving innovative,
cost-effective, research-based individualized learning, instruction, and assessment under this
section and section 124D.10;
   (4) demonstrate and help evaluate instructional alternatives to age-based grade progression;
   (5) more effectively motivate students and teachers; and
    (6) expand use of learning technology to support individualized learning, instruction,
assessment, and achievement.
    Subd. 2. Agreement. (a) The school board and a school site may enter into an agreement under
this section solely to develop and implement an individualized learning and achievement contract
under subdivision 4.
    ­
    (­
     a­
      ) (b) Upon the request of 60 percent of the licensed employees of a site or a school site
decision-making team, the school board shall enter into discussions to reach an agreement
concerning the governance, management, or control of the school. A school site decision-making
team may include the school principal, teachers in the school or their designee, other employees
in the school, representatives of pupils in the school, or other members in the community. A
school site decision-making team must include at least one parent of a pupil in the school. For
purposes of formation of a new site, a school site decision-making team may be a team of teachers
that is recognized by the board as a site. The school site decision-making team shall include the
school principal or other person having general control and supervision of the school. The site
decision-making team must reflect the diversity of the education site. At least one-half of the
members shall be employees of the district, unless an employee is the parent of a student enrolled in
the school site, in which case the employee may elect to serve as a parent member of the site team.
   ­
   (b
    ­­) (c) School site decision-making agreements must delegate powers, duties, and broad
management responsibilities to site teams and involve staff members, students as appropriate, and
parents in decision making.
    ­
    (­
     c­
      ) (d) An agreement shall include a statement of powers, duties, responsibilities, and authority
to be delegated to and within the site.
   ­
   (d
    ­­) (e) An agreement may include:
   (1) an achievement contract according to subdivision 4;
    (2) a mechanism to allow principals, a site leadership team, or other persons having general
control and supervision of the school, to make decisions regarding how financial and personnel
resources are best allocated at the site and from whom goods or services are purchased;
   (3) a mechanism to implement parental involvement programs under section 124D.895 and to
provide for effective parental communication and feedback on this involvement at the site level;
6126                                  JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                     [107TH DAY

   (4) a provision that would allow the team to determine who is hired into licensed and nonlicensed
positions;
   (5) a provision that would allow teachers to choose the principal or other person having general
control;
    (6) an amount of revenue allocated to the site under subdivision 3; and
    (7) any other powers and duties determined appropriate by the board.
    The school board of the district remains the legal employer under clauses (4) and (5).
  ­
  (­
   e­
    ) (f) Any powers or duties not delegated to the school site management team in the school site
management agreement shall remain with the school board.
   ­
   (­
    f­
     ) (g) Approved agreements shall be filed with the commissioner. If a school board denies a
request or the school site and school board fail to reach an agreement to enter into a school site
management agreement, the school board shall provide a copy of the request and the reasons for its
denial to the commissioner.
    ­
    (g
     ­­) (h) A site decision-making grant program is established, consistent with this subdivision, to
allow sites to implement an agreement that at least:
    (1) notwithstanding subdivision 3, allocates to the site all revenue that is attributable to the
students at that site;
    (2) includes a provision, consistent with current law and the collective bargaining agreement in
effect, that allows the site team to decide who is selected from within the district for licensed and
nonlicensed positions at the site and to make staff assignments in the site; and
    (3) includes a completed performance agreement under subdivision 4.
    The commissioner shall establish the form and manner of the application for a grant and annually,
at the end of each fiscal year, report to the house of representatives and senate committees having
jurisdiction over education on the progress of the program.
    Subd. 3. Revenue and cost allocation. Revenue for a fiscal year received or receivable by the
district shall be allocated to education sites based on the agreement between the school board and the
site decision-making team. Revenue shall remain allocated to each site until used by the site. The site
teams and the board may enter an agreement that permits the district to provide services and retain
the revenue required to pay for the services provided. The district remains responsible for legally
entering into contracts and expending funds. For the purposes of this subdivision, "allocation" means
that the determination of the use of the revenue shall be under the control of the site. The district may
charge the accounts of each site the actual costs of goods and services from the general or capital
funds attributable to the site.
     Subd. 4. Achievement contract. A school board may enter a written education site achievement
contract with each site decision-making team for ­h      t­­ep ­­

   Subd. 5. Commissioner's role. The commissioner of education, in consultation with appropriate
educational organizations, shall:
    (1) upon request, provide technical support for districts and sites with agreements under this
section;
   (2) conduct and compile research on the effectiveness of site decision making; and
    (3) periodically report on and evaluate the effectiveness of site management agreements on a

which the principal is assigned.
    (b) To enhance a principal's leadership skills and support and improve teaching practices, school
performance, and student achievement, a district must develop and implement a performance-based
system for annually evaluating school principals assigned to supervise a school building within
the district. The evaluation must be designed to improve teaching and learning by supporting
the principal in shaping the school's professional environment and developing teacher quality,
performance, and effectiveness. The annual evaluation must:
   (1) support and improve a principal's instructional leadership, organizational management,
and professional development, and strengthen the principal's capacity in the areas of instruction,
supervision, evaluation, and teacher development;
   (2) include formative and summative evaluations;

high-quality instruction;
   (4) include on-the-job observations and previous evaluations;
    (5) allow surveys to help identify a principal's effectiveness, leadership skills and processes, and
strengths and weaknesses in exercising leadership in pursuit of school success;

curriculum and instruction, student learning, and a collaborative professional culture; and
   (8) for principals not meeting standards of professional practice or other criteria under this
subdivision, implement a plan to improve the principal's performance and specify the procedure
and consequence if the principal's performance is not improved.
   The provisions of this paragraph are intended to provide districts with sufficient flexibility to
accommodate district needs and goals related to developing, supporting, and evaluating principals.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for the 2013-2014 school year and later.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 124D.10, subdivision 3, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 3. Authorizer. (a) For purposes of this section, the terms defined in this subdivision have
the meanings given them.
    "Application" to receive approval as an authorizer means the proposal an eligible authorizer
submits to the commissioner under paragraph (c) before that authorizer is able to submit any affidavit
to charter to a school.
   "Application" under subdivision 4 means the charter school business plan a school developer
submits to an authorizer for approval to establish a charter school that documents the school
developer's mission statement, school purposes, program design, financial plan, governance and
management structure, and background and experience, plus any other information the authorizer
requests. The application also shall include a "statement of assurances" of legal compliance
prescribed by the commissioner.
    "Affidavit" means a written statement the authorizer submits to the commissioner for approval
to establish a charter school under subdivision 4 attesting to its review and approval process before
chartering a school.
   (b) The following organizations may authorize one or more charter schools:
    (1) a school board; intermediate school district school board; education district organized under
sections 123A.15 to 123A.19;
   (2) a charitable organization under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
107TH DAY]                          MONDAY, APRIL 23, 2012                                        6129

excluding a nonpublic sectarian or religious institution, any person other than a natural person that
directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with the nonpublic sectarian or religious institution, and any other charitable
organization under this clause that in the federal IRS Form 1023, Part IV, describes activities
indicating a religious purpose, that:
   (i) is a member of the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits or the Minnesota Council on
Foundations;
   (ii) is registered with the attorney general's office; and
    (iii) is incorporated in the state of Minnesota and has been operating continuously for at least
five years but does not operate a charter school;
    (3) a Minnesota private college, notwithstanding clause (2), that grants two- or four-year degrees
and is registered with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education under chapter 136A; community
college, state university, or technical college governed by the Board of Trustees of the Minnesota
State Colleges and Universities; or the University of Minnesota;
   (4) a nonprofit corporation subject to chapter 317A, described in section 317A.905, and exempt
from federal income tax under section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, may
authorize one or more charter schools if the charter school has operated for at least three years
under a different authorizer and if the nonprofit corporation has existed for at least 25 years; or
     (5) single-purpose authorizers that are charitable, nonsectarian organizations formed under
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and incorporated in the state of Minnesota
whose sole purpose is to charter schools. Eligible organizations interested in being approved as
an authorizer under this paragraph must submit a proposal to the commissioner that includes the
provisions of paragraph (c) and a five-year financial plan. Such authorizers shall consider and
approve applications using the criteria provided in subdivision 4 and shall not limit the applications
it solicits, considers, or approves to any single curriculum, learning program, or method.
     (c) An eligible authorizer under this subdivision must apply to the commissioner for approval as
an authorizer before submitting any affidavit to the commissioner to charter a school. The application
for approval as a charter school authorizer must demonstrate the applicant's ability to implement
the procedures and satisfy the criteria for chartering a school under this section. The commissioner
must approve or disapprove an application within 45 business days of the application deadline.
If the commissioner disapproves the application, the commissioner must notify the applicant of the
specific deficiencies in writing and the applicant then has 20 business days to address the deficiencies
to the commissioner's satisfaction. After the 20 business days expire, the commissioner has 15
business days to make a final decision to approve or disapprove the application. Failing to address
the deficiencies to the commissioner's satisfaction makes an applicant ineligible to be an authorizer.
The commissioner, in establishing criteria for approval, must consider the applicant's:

to withdraw as an approved authorizer for a reason unrelated to any cause under subdivision 23,
the authorizer must notify all its chartered schools and the commissioner in writing by July 15 of
its intent to withdraw as an authorizer on June 30 in the next calendar year. The commissioner
may approve the transfer of a charter school to a new authorizer under this paragraph after the new
authorizer submits an affidavit to the commissioner.
   (g) The authorizer must participate in department-approved training.
    (h) An authorizer that chartered a school before August 1, 2009, must apply by June 30, 2012, to
the commissioner for approval, under paragraph (c), to continue as an authorizer under this section.
For purposes of this paragraph, an authorizer that fails to submit a timely application is ineligible
to charter a school.
   (i) The commissioner shall review an authorizer's performance every five years in a manner and
form determined by the commissioner and may review an authorizer's performance more frequently

at the commissioner's own initiative or at the request of a charter school operator, charter school
board member, or other interested party. The commissioner, after completing the review, shall
transmit a report with findings to the authorizer. If, consistent with this section, the commissioner
finds that an authorizer has not fulfilled the requirements of this section, the commissioner may
subject the authorizer to corrective action, which may include terminating the contract with the
charter school board of directors of a school it chartered. The commissioner must notify the
authorizer in writing of any findings that may subject the authorizer to corrective action and the
authorizer then has 15 business days to request an informal hearing before the commissioner takes
corrective action. If the commissioner terminates a contract between an authorizer and a charter
school under this paragraph, the commissioner may assist the charter school in acquiring a new
authorizer.
    (j) The commissioner may at any time take corrective action against an authorizer, including
terminating an authorizer's ability to charter a school for:
   (1) failing to demonstrate the criteria under paragraph (c) under which the commissioner
approved the authorizer;
    (2) violating a term of the chartering contract between the authorizer and the charter school board
of directors;
   (3) unsatisfactory performance as an approved authorizer; or
    (4) any good cause shown that provides the commissioner a legally sufficient reason to take
corrective action against an authorizer.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 124D.10, subdivision 4, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 4. Formation of school. (a) An authorizer, after receiving an application from a school
developer, may charter a licensed teacher under section 122A.18, subdivision 1, or a group of
individuals that includes one or more licensed teachers under section 122A.18, subdivision 1,
to operate a school subject to the commissioner's approval of the authorizer's affidavit under
paragraph (b). The school must be organized and operated as a nonprofit corporation under chapter
317A and the provisions under the applicable chapter shall apply to the school except as provided
in this section.
    Notwithstanding sections 465.717 and 465.719, a school district, subject to this section and
section 124D.11, may create a corporation for the purpose of establishing a charter school.
    (b) Before the operators may establish and operate a school, the authorizer must file an affidavit
with the commissioner stating its intent to charter a school. An authorizer must file a separate
affidavit for each school it intends to charter. The affidavit must state the terms and conditions
under which the authorizer would charter a school and how the authorizer intends to oversee the
fiscal and student performance of the charter school and to comply with the terms of the written
contract between the authorizer and the charter school board of directors under subdivision 6.
The commissioner must approve or disapprove the authorizer's affidavit within 60 business days
of receipt of the affidavit. If the commissioner disapproves the affidavit, the commissioner shall
notify the authorizer of the deficiencies in the affidavit and the authorizer then has 20 business days
to address the deficiencies. If the authorizer does not address deficiencies to the commissioner's
6132                                  JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                      [107TH DAY

satisfaction, the commissioner's disapproval is final. Failure to obtain commissioner approval
precludes an authorizer from chartering the school that is the subject of this affidavit.
    (c) The authorizer may prevent an approved charter school from opening for operation if, among
other grounds, the charter school violates this section or does not meet the ready-to-open standards
that are part of the authorizer's oversight and evaluation process or are stipulated in the charter
school contract.
    (d) The operators authorized to organize and operate a school, before entering into a contract
or other agreement for professional or other services, goods, or facilities, must incorporate as
a nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and must establish a board of directors composed
of at least five members who are not related parties until a timely election for members of the
ongoing charter school board of directors is held according to the school's articles and bylaws
under paragraph (f). A charter school board of directors must be composed of at least five members
who are not related parties. Staff members employed at the school, including teachers providing
instruction under a contract with a cooperative, and all parents or legal guardians of children
enrolled in the school are the voters eligible to elect the members of the school's board of directors.
A charter school must notify eligible voters of the school board election dates at least 30 days
before the election. Board of director meetings must comply with chapter 13D.

an employee of the charter school; and (iii) an interested community member who is not employed
by the charter school and does not have a child enrolled in the school. The board may be a teacher
majority board composed of teachers described in this paragraph. The chief financial officer and the
chief administrator may only serve as ex-officio nonvoting board members and may not serve as
a voting member of the board. Charter school employees shall not serve on the board unless item
(i) applies. Contractors providing facilities, goods, or services to a charter school shall not serve on
the board of directors of the charter school. Board bylaws shall outline the process and procedures
for changing the board's governance model, consistent with chapter 317A. A board may change its
governance model only:
   (1) by a majority vote of the board of directors and the licensed teachers employed by the
school, including licensed teachers providing instruction under a contract between the school and a
cooperative; and
   (2) with the authorizer's approval.
   Any change in board governance must conform with the board structure established under this
paragraph.
   (h) The granting or renewal of a charter by an authorizer must not be conditioned upon the
bargaining unit status of the employees of the school.
    (i) The granting or renewal of a charter school by an authorizer must not be contingent on
the charter school being required to contract, lease, or purchase services from the authorizer.
Any potential contract, lease, or purchase of service from an authorizer must be disclosed to the
commissioner, accepted through an open bidding process, and be a separate contract from the
charter contract. The school must document the open bidding process. An authorizer must not enter
into a contract to provide management and financial services for a school that it authorizes, unless
the school documents that it received at least two competitive bids.
    (j) An authorizer may permit the board of directors of a charter school to expand the operation
of the charter school to additional sites or to add additional grades at the school beyond those
described in the authorizer's original affidavit as approved by the commissioner only after submitting
a supplemental affidavit for approval to the commissioner in a form and manner prescribed by the
commissioner. The supplemental affidavit must document that:
   (1) the proposed expansion plan demonstrates need and projected enrollment;
   (2) the expansion is warranted, at a minimum, by longitudinal data demonstrating students'
improved academic performance and growth on statewide assessments under chapter 120B;
   (3) the charter school is financially sound and the financing it needs to implement the proposed
expansion exists; and
   (4) the charter school has the governance structure and management capacity to carry out its
expansion.
    (k) The commissioner shall have 30 business days to review and comment on the supplemental
affidavit. The commissioner shall notify the authorizer of any deficiencies in the supplemental
affidavit and the authorizer then has 20 business days to address, to the commissioner's satisfaction,
any deficiencies in the supplemental affidavit. The school may not expand grades or add sites

board may voluntarily enter into a two-year, renewable agreement for collaboration to enhance
student achievement with a school district within whose geographic boundary it operates.
   (b) A school district need not be an approved authorizer to enter into a collaboration agreement
with a charter school. A charter school need not be authorized by the school district with which it
seeks to collaborate.
   (c) A charter school authorizer is prohibited from requiring a collaboration agreement as a
condition of entering into or renewing a charter contract as defined in subdivision 6.
   (d) Nothing in this subdivision or in the collaboration agreement may impact in any way, the
authority or autonomy of the charter school.
    (e) Nothing in this subdivision or in the collaboration agreement shall cause the state to pay
twice for the same student, service or facility or otherwise impact state funding, or the flow thereof,
to the school district or the charter school.
    (f) The collaboration agreement may include, but need not be limited to, collaboration regarding
facilities, transportation, training, student achievement, assessments, mutual performance standards
and other areas of mutual agreement.
    (g) The school district may include the academic performance of the students of a collaborative
charter school site operating within the geographic boundaries of the school district, for purposes
of student assessment and reporting to the state.
   (h) Districts, authorizers, or charter schools entering into a collaborative agreement are
equally and collectively subject to the same state and federal accountability measures for student
achievement, school performance outcomes, and school improvement strategies. The collaborative

   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 126C.40, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. To lease building or land. (a) When an independent or a special school district
or a group of independent or special school districts finds it economically advantageous to rent
or lease a building or land for any instructional purposes or for school storage or furniture repair,
and it determines that the operating capital revenue authorized under section 126C.10, subdivision
13, is insufficient for this purpose, it may apply to the commissioner for permission to make an
additional capital expenditure levy for this purpose. An application for permission to levy under
this subdivision must contain financial justification for the proposed levy, the terms and conditions
of the proposed lease, and a description of the space to be leased and its proposed use.
    (b) The criteria for approval of applications to levy under this subdivision must include: the
reasonableness of the price, the appropriateness of the space to the proposed activity, the feasibility
of transporting pupils to the leased building or land, conformity of the lease to the laws and rules
of the state of Minnesota, and the appropriateness of the proposed lease to the space needs and the
financial condition of the district. The commissioner must not authorize a levy under this subdivision
in an amount greater than the cost to the district of renting or leasing a building or land for approved
purposes. The proceeds of this levy must not be used for custodial or other maintenance services.
A district may not levy under this subdivision for the purpose of leasing or renting a district-owned
building or site to itself.
    (c) For agreements finalized after July 1, 1997, a district may not levy under this subdivision
for the purpose of leasing: (1) a newly constructed building used primarily for regular kindergarten,
elementary, or secondary instruction; or (2) a newly constructed building addition or additions used
primarily for regular kindergarten, elementary, or secondary instruction that contains more than 20
percent of the square footage of the previously existing building.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), a district may levy under this subdivision for the purpose
of leasing or renting a district-owned building or site to itself only if the amount is needed by the

district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement, installment purchase agreement,
or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, and the levy meets the requirements of
paragraph (c). A levy authorized for a district by the commissioner under this paragraph may be
in the amount needed by the district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement,
installment purchase agreement, or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, provided
that any agreement include a provision giving the school districts the right to terminate the agreement
annually without penalty.
    (e) The total levy under this subdivision for a district for any year must not exceed $150 times
the resident pupil units for the fiscal year to which the levy is attributable.
   (f) For agreements for which a review and comment have been submitted to the Department of
Education after April 1, 1998, the term "instructional purpose" as used in this subdivision excludes
expenditures on stadiums.
   (g) The commissioner of education may authorize a school district to exceed the limit in
paragraph (e) if the school district petitions the commissioner for approval. The commissioner
shall grant approval to a school district to exceed the limit in paragraph (e) for not more than five
years if the district meets the following criteria:
   (1) the school district has been experiencing pupil enrollment growth in the preceding five years;
   (2) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term public interest;
   (3) the purpose of the increased levy promotes colocation of government services; and
   (4) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term interest of the district by avoiding over
construction of school facilities.
    (h) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with leases of administrative and classroom space
for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed $43 times the adjusted
marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to any other authority
authorized under this section.
    (i) In addition to the allowable capital levies in paragraph (a), for taxes payable in 2012 to
2023, a district that is a member of the "Technology and Information Education Systems" data
processing joint board, that finds it economically advantageous to enter into a lease agreement to
finance improvements to a building and land for a group of school districts or special school districts
for staff development purposes, may levy for its portion of lease costs attributed to the district within
the total levy limit in paragraph (e). The total levy authority under this paragraph shall not exceed
$632,000.
    (j) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a district may levy under this subdivision for the purpose of
leasing administrative space if the district can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commissioner
that the lease cost for the administrative space is no greater than the lease cost for instructional space
that the district would otherwise lease. The commissioner must deny this levy authority unless the
district passes a resolution stating its intent to lease instructional space under this section if the
commissioner does not grant authority under this paragraph. The resolution must also certify that
the lease cost for administrative space under this paragraph is no greater than the lease cost for the
district's proposed instructional lease.

to regulate and define additional substances which contain quantities of a substance possessing abuse
potential in accordance with the following criteria:
    (1) The Board of Pharmacy shall place a substance in Schedule I if it finds that the substance
has: A high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack
of accepted safety for use under medical supervision.
6168                                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                            [107TH DAY

   (2) The Board of Pharmacy shall place a substance in Schedule II if it finds that the substance
has: A high potential for abuse, currently accepted medical use in the United States, or currently
accepted medical use with severe restrictions, and that abuse may lead to severe psychological or
physical dependence.
   (3) The Board of Pharmacy shall place a substance in Schedule III if it finds that the substance
has: A potential for abuse less than the substances listed in Schedules I and II, currently accepted
medical use in treatment in the United States, and that abuse may lead to moderate or low physical
dependence or high psychological dependence.
   (4) The Board of Pharmacy shall place a substance in Schedule IV if it finds that the substance
has: A low potential for abuse relative to the substances in Schedule III, currently accepted medical
use in treatment in the United States, and that abuse may lead to limited physical dependence or
psychological dependence relative to the substances in Schedule III.
   (5) The Board of Pharmacy shall place a substance in Schedule V if it finds that the substance
has: A low potential for abuse relative to the substances listed in Schedule IV, currently accepted
medical use in treatment in the United States, and limited physical dependence and/or psychological
dependence liability relative to the substances listed in Schedule IV.
   Subd. 8. Add, delete, or reschedule substances. The state Board of Pharmacy may, by rule,
add substances to or delete or reschedule substances listed in this section. The Board of Pharmacy
may not delete or reschedule a drug that is in Schedule I, except as provided in subdivision 12.
    In making a determination regarding a substance, the Board of Pharmacy shall consider the
following: The actual or relative potential for abuse, the scientific evidence of its pharmacological
effect, if known, the state of current scientific knowledge regarding the substance, the history and
current pattern of abuse, the scope, duration, and significance of abuse, the risk to public health,
the potential of the substance to produce psychic or physiological dependence liability, and whether
the substance is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under this section. The
state Board of Pharmacy may include any nonnarcotic drug authorized by federal law for medicinal
use in a schedule only if such drug must, under either federal or state law or rule, be sold only on
prescription.

    Subd. 8b. Board of Pharmacy; expedited scheduling of additional substances. (a) The state
Board of Pharmacy may, by rule, add a substance to Schedule I provided that it finds that the
substance has a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical use in the United States,
has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, has known adverse health effects,
and is currently available for use within the state. For the purposes of this subdivision only, the board
may use the expedited rulemaking process under section 14.389. The scheduling of a substance
under this subdivision expires the day after the adjournment of the legislative session immediately
following the substance's scheduling unless the legislature by law ratifies the action.
107TH DAY]                                       MONDAY, APRIL 23, 2012                                                              6169

    (b) If the board schedules a substance under this subdivision, the board shall notify in a timely
manner the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate and house of representatives
committees having jurisdiction over criminal justice and health policy and finance of the action
and the reasons for it. The notice must include a copy of the administrative law judge's decision
on the matter.
     (c) This subdivision expires August 1, 2014.
   Subd. 9. Except substances by rule. The state Board of Pharmacy may by rule except any
compound, mixture, or preparation containing any stimulant or depressant substance listed in

application of all or any part of this chapter, if the compound, mixture, or preparation contains one
or more active medicinal ingredients not having a stimulant or depressant effect on the central
nervous system; provided, that such admixtures shall be included therein in such combinations,
quantity, proportion, or concentration as to vitiate the potential for abuse of the substances which
do have a stimulant or depressant effect on the central nervous system.
    Subd. 10. Dextromethorphan. Dextromethorphan shall not be deemed to be included in any
schedule by reason of the enactment of Laws 1971, chapter 937, unless controlled pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this section.
    Subd. 12. Coordination of controlled substance regulation with federal law and state
statute. If any substance is designated, rescheduled, or deleted as a controlled substance under
federal law and notice thereof is given to the state Board of Pharmacy, the state Board of Pharmacy
shall similarly control the substance under this chapter, after the expiration of 30 days from
publication in the Federal Register of a final order designating a substance as a controlled substance
or rescheduling or deleting a substance. Such order shall be filed with the secretary of state. If
within that 30-day period, the state Board of Pharmacy objects to inclusion, rescheduling, or
deletion, it shall publish the reasons for objection and afford all interested parties an opportunity to
be heard. At the conclusion of the hearing, the state Board of Pharmacy shall publish its decision,
which shall be subject to the provisions of chapter 14.
      In exercising the authority granted by this chapter, the state Board of Pharmacy shall be subject
to the provisions of chapter 14. T             ­h­­e­s­a t­ B

on or after that date.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 152.18, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
     Subdivision 1. Deferring prosecution for certain first time drug offenders. If any person
who has not previously participated in or completed a diversion program authorized under section
401.065 or who has not previously been placed on probation without a judgment of guilty and
thereafter been discharged from probation under this section is found guilty of a violation of section
152.024, subdivision 2, 152.025, subdivision 2, or 152.027, subdivision 2, 3, o  ­­
                                                                                  r 4, or 6, paragraph
(d), for possession of a controlled substance, after trial or upon a plea of guilty, and the court
determines that the violation does not qualify as a subsequent controlled substance conviction under
section 152.01, subdivision 16a, the court may, without entering a judgment of guilty and with
the consent of the person, defer further proceedings and place the person on probation upon such
reasonable conditions as it may require and for a period, not to exceed the maximum sentence
provided for the violation. The court may give the person the opportunity to attend and participate
in an appropriate program of education regarding the nature and effects of alcohol and drug abuse
as a stipulation of probation. Upon violation of a condition of the probation, the court may enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided. The court may, in its discretion, dismiss
the proceedings against the person and discharge the person from probation before the expiration
of the maximum period prescribed for the person's probation. If during the period of probation the
person does not violate any of the conditions of the probation, then upon expiration of the period
the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against that person. Discharge and
dismissal under this subdivision shall be without court adjudication of guilt, but a not public record
of it shall be retained by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension for the purpose of use by the courts in
determining the merits of subsequent proceedings against the person. The not public record may also
be opened only upon court order for purposes of a criminal investigation, prosecution, or sentencing.
Upon request by law enforcement, prosecution, or corrections authorities, the bureau shall notify the
requesting party of the existence of the not public record and the right to seek a court order to open

it pursuant to this section. The court shall forward a record of any discharge and dismissal under
this subdivision to the bureau which shall make and maintain the not public record of it as provided
under this subdivision. The discharge or dismissal shall not be deemed a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime or for any other purpose.
      For purposes of this subdivision, "not public" has the meaning given in section 13.02, subdivision
8a.

the request. For the purposes of this subdivision, an urgency means that (1) the expenditure of the
federal funds would prevent imminent harm to life or property; or (2) failure to encumber or allot
the federal funds before the expiration of the soonest time provided under subdivision 4 would
clearly result in a loss of the federal funds. If the members of the commission make a positive
recommendation or no recommendation, or if the commission does not meet within 15 days after
the date the request was submitted, the commissioner shall approve or disapprove the request and the
federal money may be allotted for expenditure. If the commission makes a negative recommendation
or a recommendation for further review on a request within 15 days after the date the request was
submitted, the commissioner shall not approve expenditure of that federal money. If a request to
expend federal money submitted under this subdivision receives a negative recommendation or a
recommendation for further review, the request may be submitted again under subdivision 2 or
subdivision 6."

     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 12.22, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Federal aid. Whenever the federal government, or an agency or officer of the
federal government, offers to the state, or through the state to any political subdivision of the state,
services, equipment, supplies, materials, or funds by way of gift, grant or loan, for the purposes of
emergency management, the state, acting through the governor, or the political subdivision, acting
with the consent of the governor and through its governing body, may accept the offer and then may
authorize an officer of the state or of the political subdivision, as the case may be, to receive the
services, equipment, supplies, materials, or funds on behalf of the state or the political subdivision
and subject to the terms of the offer and the rules, if any, of the agency making the offer. Money
received by the governor or any state agency under this subdivision is appropriated to the state
agency receiving the funds to carry out the emergency management purposes for which the money
is received. However, no money or other funds may be accepted or received as a loan nor any
indebtedness incurred except as provided by law.

Senate April 17, 2012, as follows:
   (The text of the amended House File is identical to S.F. No. 1830.)
   Page 28, delete section 36 and insert:
   "Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103G.2241, subdivision 11, is amended to read:
   Subd. 11. Exemption conditions. (a) A person conducting an activity in a wetland under an
exemption in subdivisions 1 to 10 shall ensure that:
   (1) appropriate erosion control measures are taken to prevent sedimentation of the water;
   (2) the activity does not block fish passage in a watercourse; and
    (3) the activity is conducted in compliance with all other applicable federal, state, and local
requirements, including best management practices and water resource protection requirements
established under chapter 103H.
    (b) An activity is exempt if it qualifies for any one of the exemptions, even though it may be
indicated as not exempt under another exemption.
   (c) Persons proposing to conduct an exempt activity are encouraged to contact the local
government unit or the local government unit's designee for advice on minimizing wetland impacts.
   (d) The board shall develop rules that address the application and implementation of exemptions
and that provide for estimates and reporting of exempt wetland impacts, including those in section
103G.2241, subdivisions 2, 6, and 9.
    (e) Persons proposing to conduct an exempt activity must, prior to commencing the work,
complete and provide to their local government a notice, on a form approved and supplied by
the Board of Water and Soil Resources, that indicates, at a minimum, the exemption claimed,
the location of the claimed exemption, the date or dates of work performed, identification of the
individual giving notice, and an estimate of the wetland type and amount of acreage affected. The
local government unit may charge a nominal fee for filing the notice, not to exceed $25. The notice
requirement does not apply to the exercise of the utilities and public works exemption. For persons
claiming the farming exemption, the notice shall be filed once at the commencement of the subject
activity and need not be filed again unless the activity or exemption claimed changes. For persons
claiming the forestry exemption, the notice requirement applies only to the extent that reporting
is not required elsewhere. Failure to file the required notice automatically renders any claimed
exemption voidable. The local government unit shall retain the exemption notices for a minimum
of ten years or such longer time as necessary to ensure compliance with the exemptions conditions
in this chapter."
