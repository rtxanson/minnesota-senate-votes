identify delays caused by the responsiveness of the proposer, lack of staff, scientific or technical
disagreements, or the level of public engagement. The report must specify the number of days from
initial submission of the application to the day of determination that the application is complete.
The report for August 1 each year must aggregate the data for the year and assess whether program
or system changes are necessary to achieve the goal. The report must be posted on the department's
Web site and submitted to the governor and the chairs and ranking minority members of the house
of representatives and senate committees having jurisdiction over natural resources policy and
finance.
   (c) The commissioner shall allow electronic submission of environmental review and permit
documents to the department.
     (d) Beginning July 1, 2011, within 30 business days of application for a permit subject to
paragraph (a), the commissioner of natural resources shall notify the project proposer, in writing, o                                                ­­

      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103G.291, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. Water supply plans; demand reduction. (a) Every public water supplier serving more
than 1,000 people must submit a water supply plan to the commissioner for approval by January 1,
1996. In accordance with guidelines developed by the commissioner, the plan must address projected
demands, adequacy of the water supply system and planned improvements, existing and future
water sources, natural resource impacts or limitations, emergency preparedness, water conservation,
supply and demand reduction measures, and allocation priorities that are consistent with section
103G.261. Public water suppliers must update their plan and, upon notification, submit it to the
commissioner for approval every ten years.
    (b) The water supply plan in paragraph (a) is required for all communities in the metropolitan
area, as defined in section 473.121, with a municipal water supply system and is a required element
of the local comprehensive plan required under section 473.859. Water supply plans or updates
submitted after December 31, 2008, must be consistent with the metropolitan area master water
supply plan required under section 473.1565, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2).

identify delays caused by the responsiveness of the proposer, lack of staff, scientific or technical
disagreements, or the level of public engagement. The report must specify the number of days from
initial submission of the application to the day of determination that the application is complete.
The report for August 1 each year must aggregate the data for the year and assess whether program
or system changes are necessary to achieve the goal. The report must be posted on the agency's
Web site and submitted to the governor and the chairs and ranking minority members of the house
of representatives and senate committees having jurisdiction over environment policy and finance.

      Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116.07, subdivision 4a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4a. Permits. (a) The Pollution Control Agency may issue, continue in effect or deny
permits, under such conditions as it may prescribe for the prevention of pollution, for the emission
of air contaminants, or for the installation or operation of any emission facility, air contaminant
treatment facility, treatment facility, potential air contaminant storage facility, or storage facility, or
any part thereof, or for the sources or emissions of noise pollution.

    The Pollution Control Agency may also issue, continue in effect or deny permits, under
such conditions as it may prescribe for the prevention of pollution, for the storage, collection,
transportation, processing, or disposal of waste, or for the installation or operation of any system or
facility, or any part thereof, related to the storage, collection, transportation, processing, or disposal
of waste.
    The agency may not issue a permit to a facility without analyzing and considering the cumulative
levels and effects of past and current environmental pollution from all sources on the environment
and residents of the geographic area within which the facility's emissions are likely to be deposited,
provided that the facility is located in a community in a city of the first class in Hennepin County
that meets all of the following conditions:
   (1) is within a half mile of a site designated by the federal government as an EPA superfund site
due to residential arsenic contamination;
   (2) a majority of the population are low-income persons of color and American Indians;
   (3) a disproportionate percent of the children have childhood lead poisoning, asthma, or other
environmentally related health problems;
   (4) is located in a city that has experienced numerous air quality alert days of dangerous air
quality for sensitive populations between February 2007 and February 2008; and
   (5) is located near the junctions of several heavily trafficked state and county highways and two
one-way streets which carry both truck and auto traffic.
    The Pollution Control Agency may revoke or modify any permit issued under this subdivision
and section 116.081 whenever it is necessary, in the opinion of the agency, to prevent or abate
pollution.
    (b) The Pollution Control Agency has the authority for approval over the siting, expansion,
or operation of a solid waste facility with regard to environmental issues. However, the agency's
issuance of a permit does not release the permittee from any liability, penalty, or duty imposed by any
applicable county ordinances. Nothing in this chapter precludes, or shall be construed to preclude,
a county from enforcing land use controls, regulations, and ordinances existing at the time of the
permit application and adopted pursuant to sections 366.10 to 366.181, 394.21 to 394.37, or 462.351
to 462.365, with regard to the siting, expansion, or operation of a solid waste facility.
    (c) Except as prohibited by federal law, a person may commence construction, reconstruction,
replacement, or modification of any facility prior to the issuance of a construction permit by the
agency.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116.07, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7e. Manure digester permits. Except for areas within the metropolitan area, as defined
in section 473.121, subdivision 2, or within cities of the first or second class, an air emission permit
is not required for a manure digester and associated electrical generation equipment that process
manure from the farm or provide for backup power for the farm.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116J.035, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 8. Minnesota Business First Stop. (a) The commissioner of employment and economic

development shall, through the multiagency collaboration called "Minnesota Business First Stop,"
ensure the coordination, implementation, and administration of state permits, including:
    (1) establishing a mechanism in state government that will coordinate administrative
decision-making procedures and related quasijudicial and judicial review pertaining to permits
related to the state's air, land, and water resources;
    (2) providing coordination and understanding between federal, state, and local governmental
units in the administration of the various programs relating to air, water, and land resources;
   (3) identifying all existing state permits and other approvals, compliance schedules, or other
programs that pertain to the use of natural resources and protection of the environment; and
    (4) recommending legislative or administrative modifications to existing permit programs to
increase their efficiency and utility.
    (b) A person proposing a project may apply to Minnesota Business First Stop for assistance in
obtaining necessary state permits and other approvals. Upon request, the commissioner shall to the
extent practicable:
   (1) provide a list of all federal, state, and local permits and other required approvals for the
project;
    (2) provide a plan that will coordinate federal, state, and local administrative decision-making
practices, including monitoring, analysis and reporting, public comments and hearings, and
issuances of permits and approvals;
   (3) provide a timeline for the issuance of all federal, state, and local permits and other approvals
required for the project;
   (4) coordinate the execution of any memorandum of understanding between the person
proposing a project and any federal, state, or local agency;
   (5) coordinate all federal, state, or local public comment periods and hearings; and
   (6) provide other assistance requested to facilitate final approval and issuance of all federal, state,
and local permits and other approvals required for the project.
    (c) Notwithstanding section 16A.1283, as necessary, the commissioner may negotiate a schedule
to assess the project proposer for reasonable costs that any state agency incurs in coordinating the
implementation and administration of state permits, and the proposer shall pay the assessed costs to
the commissioner. Money received by the environmental permits coordinator must be credited to an
account in the special revenue fund and is appropriated to the commissioner to cover the assessed
costs incurred.
    (d) The coordination of implementation and administration of state permits is not governmental
action under section 116D.04.

defined in this subdivision have the meanings given them.
     (a) "Cellulosic biofuel" means transportation fuel derived from cellulosic materials.
    (b) "Cellulosic material" means an agricultural or wood feedstock primarily comprised of
cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin or a combination of those ingredients grown on agricultural
lands or harvested on timber lands.
    (c) "Agricultural land" means land used for horticultural, row, close grown, pasture, and hayland
crops; growing nursery stocks; animal feedlots; farm yards; associated building sites; and public and
private drainage systems and field roads located on any of that land.
     (d) "Cellulosic biofuel facility" means a facility at which cellulosic biofuel is produced.
   (e) "Perennial crops" means agriculturally produced plants that have a life cycle of at least three

   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 116D.04, subdivision 2a, is amended to
read:
     Subd. 2a. When prepared. Where there is potential for significant environmental effects
resulting from any major governmental action, the action shall be preceded by a detailed
environmental impact statement prepared by the responsible governmental unit. The environmental
impact statement shall be an analytical rather than an encyclopedic document which describes the
proposed action in detail, analyzes its significant environmental impacts, discusses appropriate
alternatives to the proposed action and their impacts, and explores methods by which adverse
environmental impacts of an action could be mitigated. The environmental impact statement shall
also analyze those economic, employment and sociological effects that cannot be avoided should
the action be implemented. To ensure its use in the decision-making process, the environmental
impact statement shall be prepared as early as practical in the formulation of an action. N                                      ­o­

    (a) The board shall by rule establish categories of actions for which environmental impact
statements and for which environmental assessment worksheets shall be prepared as well as
96TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 29, 2012                                        5281

categories of actions for which no environmental review is required under this section. A mandatory
environmental assessment worksheet shall not be required for the expansion of an ethanol plant,
as defined in section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), or the conversion of an ethanol plant
to a biobutanol facility or the expansion of a biobutanol facility as defined in section 41A.105,
subdivision 1a, based on the capacity of the expanded or converted facility to produce alcohol
fuel, but must be required if the ethanol plant or biobutanol facility meets or exceeds thresholds
of other categories of actions for which environmental assessment worksheets must be prepared.
The responsible governmental unit for an ethanol plant or biobutanol facility project for which
an environmental assessment worksheet is prepared shall be the state agency with the greatest
responsibility for supervising or approving the project as a whole.
    A mandatory environmental impact statement shall not be required for a facility or plant located
outside the seven-county metropolitan area that produces less than 125,000,000 gallons of ethanol,
biobutanol, or cellulosic biofuel annually, if the facility or plant is: an ethanol plant, as defined in
section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b); a biobutanol facility, as defined in section 41A.105,
subdivision 1a, clause (1); or a cellulosic biofuel facility, as defined in section 41A.10, subdivision
1, paragraph (d).
    (b) The responsible governmental unit shall promptly publish notice of the completion of
an environmental assessment worksheet in a manner to be determined by the board and shall
provide copies of the environmental assessment worksheet to the board and its member agencies.
Comments on the need for an environmental impact statement may be submitted to the responsible
governmental unit during a 30-day period following publication of the notice that an environmental
assessment worksheet has been completed. The responsible governmental unit's decision on the
need for an environmental impact statement shall be based on the environmental assessment
worksheet and the comments received during the comment period, and shall be made within 15
days after the close of the comment period. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not
more than 15 additional days upon the request of the responsible governmental unit.
    (c) An environmental assessment worksheet shall also be prepared for a proposed action
whenever material evidence accompanying a petition by not less than 100 individuals who reside
or own property in the state, submitted before the proposed project has received final approval
by the appropriate governmental units, demonstrates that, because of the nature or location of a
proposed action, there may be potential for significant environmental effects. Petitions requesting
the preparation of an environmental assessment worksheet shall be submitted to the board. The
chair of the board shall determine the appropriate responsible governmental unit and forward the
petition to it. A decision on the need for an environmental assessment worksheet shall be made by
the responsible governmental unit within 15 days after the petition is received by the responsible
governmental unit. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not more than 15 additional
days upon request of the responsible governmental unit.
   (d) Except in an environmentally sensitive location where Minnesota Rules, part 4410.4300,
subpart 29, item B, applies, the proposed action is exempt from environmental review under this
chapter and rules of the board, if:
   (1) the proposed action is:
   (i) an animal feedlot facility with a capacity of less than 1,000 animal units; or
   (ii) an expansion of an existing animal feedlot facility with a total cumulative capacity of less
5282                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [96TH DAY

than 1,000 animal units;
    (2) the application for the animal feedlot facility includes a written commitment by the proposer
to design, construct, and operate the facility in full compliance with Pollution Control Agency
feedlot rules; and
    (3) the county board holds a public meeting for citizen input at least ten business days prior
to the Pollution Control Agency or county issuing a feedlot permit for the animal feedlot facility
unless another public meeting for citizen input has been held with regard to the feedlot facility to be
permitted. The exemption in this paragraph is in addition to other exemptions provided under other
law and rules of the board.
    (e) The board may, prior to final approval of a proposed project, require preparation of an
environmental assessment worksheet by a responsible governmental unit selected by the board for
any action where environmental review under this section has not been specifically provided for by
rule or otherwise initiated.
    (f) An early and open process shall be utilized to limit the scope of the environmental impact
statement to a discussion of those impacts, which, because of the nature or location of the project,
have the potential for significant environmental effects. The same process shall be utilized to
determine the form, content and level of detail of the statement as well as the alternatives which
are appropriate for consideration in the statement. In addition, the permits which will be required
for the proposed action shall be identified during the scoping process. Further, the process shall
identify those permits for which information will be developed concurrently with the environmental
impact statement. The board shall provide in its rules for the expeditious completion of the scoping
process. The determinations reached in the process shall be incorporated into the order requiring
the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (g) The responsible governmental unit shall, to the extent practicable, avoid duplication and
ensure coordination between state and federal environmental review and between environmental
review and environmental permitting. Whenever practical, information needed by a governmental
unit for making final decisions on permits or other actions required for a proposed project shall
be developed in conjunction with the preparation of an environmental impact statement. When an
environmental impact statement is prepared for a project requiring multiple permits for which two
or more agencies' decision processes include either mandatory or discretionary hearings before a
hearing officer prior to the agencies' decision on the permit, the agencies may, notwithstanding any
law or rule to the contrary, conduct the hearings in a single consolidated hearing process if requested
by the proposer. All agencies having jurisdiction over a permit that is included in the consolidated
hearing shall participate. The responsible governmental unit shall establish appropriate procedures
for the consolidated hearing process, including procedures to ensure that the consolidated hearing
process is consistent with the applicable requirements for each permit regarding the rights and duties
of parties to the hearing, and shall utilize the earliest applicable hearing procedure to initiate the
hearing. The procedures of section 116C.28, subdivision 2, apply to the consolidated hearing.
    (h) An environmental impact statement shall be prepared and its adequacy determined within
280 days after notice of its preparation unless the time is extended by consent of the parties or
by the governor for good cause. The responsible governmental unit shall determine the adequacy
of an environmental impact statement, unless within 60 days after notice is published that an
environmental impact statement will be prepared, the board chooses to determine the adequacy of

an environmental impact statement. If an environmental impact statement is found to be inadequate,
the responsible governmental unit shall have 60 days to prepare an adequate environmental impact
statement.
      Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116D.04, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5b. Review of environmental assessment worksheets and environmental impact
statements. By December 1, 2012, and every five years thereafter, the Environmental Quality
Board, Pollution Control Agency, Department of Natural Resources, and Department of
Transportation, after consultation with political subdivisions, shall submit to the governor and the
chairs of the house of representatives and senate committees having jurisdiction over environment
and natural resources a list of mandatory environmental assessment worksheet and mandatory
environmental impact statement categories for which the agency or a political subdivision is
designated as the responsible government unit, and for each worksheet or statement category, a
document including:
      (1) intended historical purposes of the category;
      (2) whether projects that fall within the category are also subject to local, state, or federal permits;
and
   (3) an analysis of whether the mandatory category should be modified, eliminated, or unchanged
based on its relationship to existing permits or other federal, state, or local laws or ordinances.
  Sec. 4. PILOT PROGRAM FOR ALTERNATIVE FORM OF ENVIRONMENTAL
REVIEW.
    (a) The commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency and the commissioner of natural
resources may jointly conduct a pilot program for an alternative form of environmental review as
specified in this section. This pilot program is in addition to the alternate forms of environmental
review that are authorized under Minnesota Statutes, section 116D.04, subdivision 4a. Minnesota
Rules, part 4410.3600, does not apply to the pilot program authorized in this section.
    (b) The commissioners may select up to three projects to be processed under the pilot program.
The environmental review work for each project must commence before January 1, 2014, to remain
eligible for proceeding under this program.
      (c) The pilot program procedures are as follows:
      (1) an environmental assessment worksheet is not required;
    (2) a scoping document must be prepared that identifies the issues to be analyzed, the alternatives
to be considered, and the studies to be undertaken. The scoping document results must be published
at the same time as the notice of preparation of the pilot program impact statement;
   (3) any person may submit written comments within 20 days of publication of the notice for
preparation of the pilot program impact statement. The responsible governmental unit must consider
modifying the scope of the project based on the comments;
   (4) the pilot program impact statement must be an analytical, rather than an encyclopedic,
document that describes the proposed action in detail, analyzes the action's significant environmental
impacts, discusses appropriate alternatives to the proposed action and the alternatives' impacts, and
5284                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [96TH DAY

explores methods by which adverse environmental impacts of an action could be mitigated. The
pilot program impact statement must also analyze those economic, employment, and sociological
effects that cannot be avoided should the action be implemented;
    (5) if an impact analysis is needed for permitting, the impact analysis may be summarized for
inclusion in the draft pilot program impact statement rather than the full modeling and analysis
being contained within the draft pilot program impact statement. An impact analysis must identify
the regulatory requirements, types of impact, and mitigation methods; and
    (6) the responsible governmental unit must follow the procedural notice requirements for a draft
environmental impact statement, final environmental impact statement, and notice of determination
of adequacy for an environmental impact statement.
    (d) A project proposed to be processed under the pilot program must meet all of the following
criteria:
    (1) the project meets or exceeds the threshold of a project requiring a mandatory environmental
impact statement, or the project proposer and the responsible governmental unit agree to prepare a
pilot program impact statement;
   (2) if a combustion source, other than an internal combustion engine, is part of the project, natural
gas is the only fuel that may supply the burners;
   (3) the project does not have any known projected drawdown effect on private wells;
   (4) Class I air modeling demonstrates that the project will not cause adverse impacts; and
   (5) the project is subject to Code of Federal Regulations, title 40, section 52.21, and the reviews
required for a PSD (prevention of significant deterioration) permit, including control technology,
ambient air, and Class I area impact analysis.
   (e) A project may not be processed under the pilot program if the project:
   (1) requires a federal environmental impact statement;
   (2) is for mining metallic minerals by open pit or underground methods or is a new facility for
processing metallic minerals mined by open pit or underground methods;
   (3) is for mining nonferrous metallic minerals or is a new facility for processing nonferrous
metallic minerals;
   (4) combusts solid waste or hazardous waste;
   (5) is located in a karst area; or
   (6) would result in a direct discharge of process water to surface water.
   (f) For the selected projects, the responsible governmental unit must prepare the pilot program
impact statement according to this section. Notwithstanding Minnesota Statutes, section 116D.04,
subdivision 2a, paragraph (i), the proposers of the specific project selected for the pilot program
may not prepare or submit a preliminary draft pilot program impact statement.
   (g) Minnesota Statutes, sections 116D.04, subdivisions 2b and 10, and 116D.045, apply to the
96TH DAY]                           THURSDAY, MARCH 29, 2012                                 5285

pilot program under this section.
    (h) By January 15, 2016, the commissioners shall report to the Environmental Quality Board on
the outcomes of the pilot program and include any recommendations for statute or rule changes.

an independent evaluation of available information indicates there is no liability;
   (5) denying a claim without including the following information:
   (i) the basis for the denial;
    (ii) the name, address, and telephone number of the insurer's claim service office or the claim

city, county, and school district employees, the workers' compensation system under section

be submitted under this section. The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioners of
health and commerce, and in consultation with managed care plans and county-based purchasing
plans, shall set uniform criteria, definitions, and standards for the data to be submitted, and shall
require managed care and county-based purchasing plans to comply with these criteria, definitions,
and standards when submitting data under this section. In carrying out the responsibilities of this
subdivision, the commissioner shall ensure that the data collection is implemented in an integrated
and coordinated manner that avoids unnecessary duplication of effort. To the extent possible, the
commissioner shall use existing data sources and streamline data collection in order to reduce
public and private sector administrative costs. Nothing in this subdivision shall allow release of
information that is nonpublic data pursuant to section 13.02.
    (b) Each managed care and county-based purchasing plan must annually provide to the
commissioner the following information on state public programs, in the form and manner specified
by the commissioner, according to guidelines developed by the commissioner in consultation with
managed care plans and county-based purchasing plans under contract:

    (e) The audit of the information required under paragraph (b) shall be conducted by an
independent third-party firm in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards
issued by the United States Government Accountability Office.
    (f) A managed care or county-based purchasing plan that provides services under this section
shall provide to the commissioner biweekly encounter and claims data at a detailed level and shall
participate in a quality assurance program that verifies the timeliness, completeness, accuracy,
and consistency of data provided. The commissioner shall have written protocols for the quality
assurance program that are publicly available. The commissioner shall contract with an independent
third-party auditing firm to evaluate the quality assurance protocols, the capacity of those protocols
to assure complete and accurate data, and the commissioner's implementation of the protocols.
   (g) Contracts awarded under this section to a managed care or county-based purchasing plan
must provide that the commissioner and the contracted auditor shall have unlimited access to any
and all data required to complete the audit and that this access shall be enforceable in a court of
competent jurisdiction through the process of injunctive or other appropriate relief.

implemented the legislative policy supporting performance-based regulatory systems set forth in
section 14.002.
    For purposes of clause (8), "cumulative effect" means the impact that results from incremental
impact of the proposed rule in addition to other rules, regardless of what state or federal agency
has adopted the other rules. Cumulative effects can result from individually minor but collectively
significant rules adopted over a period of time.
    The statement must also describe the agency's efforts to provide additional notification under
section 14.14, subdivision 1a, to persons or classes of persons who may be affected by the proposed
rule or must explain why these efforts were not made.
    The agency must consult with the commissioner of management and budget to help evaluate the
fiscal impact and fiscal benefits of the proposed rule on units of local government. The agency must
send a copy of the statement of need and reasonableness to the Legislative Reference Library when
the notice of hearing is mailed under section 14.14, subdivision 1a.
   Sec. 5. REPORTS.

funding committees and divisions with jurisdiction over the agency. Each report must list the rules
promulgated by the agency and provide the following information: (1) the statutory authority; (2)
an assessment of any differences between the rules and existing federal regulations; (3) a list and

rulemaking between state agencies and other state and federal agencies. Any costs of preparing
this report must be absorbed within funds otherwise appropriated to the agency."

    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, an eligible recipient is defined as an individual who has
received hospital emergency department services three or more times in a period of four consecutive
months in the past 12 months or an individual who has been identified by the individual's primary
health care provider for whom community paramedic services identified in paragraph (c) would

benefit plan shall include the following cost-sharing for all recipients, effective for services provided
on or after September 1, 2011:
   (1) $3 per nonpreventive visit, except as provided in paragraph (b). For purposes of this
subdivision, a visit means an episode of service which is required because of a recipient's
symptoms, diagnosis, or established illness, and which is delivered in an ambulatory setting by a
physician or physician ancillary, chiropractor, podiatrist, nurse midwife, advanced practice nurse,
audiologist, optician, or optometrist;
   (2) $3 for eyeglasses;

the federal poverty guidelines, total monthly cost-sharing must not exceed five percent of family
income. For purposes of this paragraph, family income is the total earned and unearned income of
the individual and the individual's spouse, if the spouse is enrolled in medical assistance and also
subject to the five percent limit on cost-sharing.
   (b) Recipients of medical assistance are responsible for all co-payments and deductibles in this
subdivision.

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2013.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 256B.69, subdivision 5a, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 5a. Managed care contracts. (a) Managed care contracts under this section and section
256L.12 shall be entered into or renewed on a calendar year basis beginning January 1, 1996.
Managed care contracts which were in effect on June 30, 1995, and set to renew on July 1, 1995,
shall be renewed for the period July 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995 at the same terms that
were in effect on June 30, 1995. The commissioner may issue separate contracts with requirements
specific to services to medical assistance recipients age 65 and older.
   (b) A prepaid health plan providing covered health services for eligible persons pursuant to
chapters 256B and 256L is responsible for complying with the terms of its contract with the
commissioner. Requirements applicable to managed care programs under chapters 256B and
256L established after the effective date of a contract with the commissioner take effect when the
contract is next issued or renewed.
    (c) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2003, the commissioner shall withhold
five percent of managed care plan payments under this section and county-based purchasing plan
payments under section 256B.692 for the prepaid medical assistance program pending completion
of performance targets. Each performance target must be quantifiable, objective, measurable, and
reasonably attainable, except in the case of a performance target based on a federal or state law
or rule. Criteria for assessment of each performance target must be outlined in writing prior to
the contract effective date. Clinical or utilization performance targets and their related criteria
must consider evidence-based research and reasonable interventions when available or applicable
to the populations served, and must be developed with input from external clinical experts
and stakeholders, including managed care plans and providers. The managed care plan must
demonstrate, to the commissioner's satisfaction, that the data submitted regarding attainment of
the performance target is accurate. The commissioner shall periodically change the administrative
measures used as performance targets in order to improve plan performance across a broader range
of administrative services. The performance targets must include measurement of plan efforts to
contain spending on health care services and administrative activities. The commissioner may
adopt plan-specific performance targets that take into account factors affecting only one plan,
including characteristics of the plan's enrollee population. The withheld funds must be returned
no sooner than July of the following year if performance targets in the contract are achieved. The
commissioner may exclude special demonstration projects under subdivision 23.
    (d) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2009, the
commissioner shall withhold three percent of managed care plan payments under this section and
county-based purchasing plan payments under section 256B.692 for the prepaid medical assistance
program. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the
following year. The commissioner may exclude special demonstration projects under subdivision
23.
    (e) Effective for services provided on or after January 1, 2010, the commissioner shall require
that managed care plans use the assessment and authorization processes, forms, timelines, standards,

documentation, and data reporting requirements, protocols, billing processes, and policies consistent
with medical assistance fee-for-service or the Department of Human Services contract requirements
consistent with medical assistance fee-for-service or the Department of Human Services contract
requirements for all personal care assistance services under section 256B.0659.
    (f) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2010, the
commissioner shall withhold 4.5 percent of managed care plan payments under this section and
county-based purchasing plan payments under section 256B.692 for the prepaid medical assistance
program. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the
following year. The commissioner may exclude special demonstration projects under subdivision
23.
    (g) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2011,
the commissioner shall include as part of the performance targets described in paragraph (c)
a reduction in the health plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health care program
enrollees by a measurable rate of five percent from the plan's utilization rate for state health care
program enrollees for the previous calendar year. Effective for services rendered on or after January
1, 2012, the commissioner shall include as part of the performance targets described in paragraph
(c) a reduction in the health plan's emergency department utilization rate for medical assistance
and MinnesotaCare enrollees, as determined by the commissioner. For 2012, the reduction shall be
based on the health plan's utilization in 2009. To earn the return of the withhold each subsequent
year, the managed care plan or county-based purchasing plan must achieve a qualifying reduction
of no less than ten percent of the plan's emergency department utilization rate for medical assistance
and MinnesotaCare enrollees, excluding M     ­­ed  i­­

is reached. When measuring performance, the commissioner must consider the difference in health
risk in a managed care plan's membership in the baseline year compared to the measurement year,
and work with the managed care or county-based purchasing plan to account for differences that
they agree are significant.
    The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the
following calendar year if the managed care plan or county-based purchasing plan demonstrates
to the satisfaction of the commissioner that a reduction in the utilization rate was achieved. The
commissioner shall structure the withhold so that the commissioner returns a portion of the withheld
funds in amounts commensurate with achieved reductions in utilization less than the target amount.
    The withhold described in this paragraph shall continue for each consecutive contract period
until the plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees is reduced by
25 percent of the plan's emergency room utilization rate for medical assistance and MinnesotaCare
enrollees for calendar year 2

this performance target and shall accept payment withholds that may be returned to the hospitals if
the performance target is achieved.
    (h) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2012, the commissioner shall
include as part of the performance targets described in paragraph (c) a reduction in the plan's
hospitalization admission rate for medical assistance and MinnesotaCare enrollees, as determined
by the commissioner. To earn the return of the withhold each year, the managed care plan or
county-based purchasing plan must achieve a qualifying reduction of no less than five percent of
the plan's hospital admission rate for medical assistance and MinnesotaCare enrollees, excluding

commissioner must evaluate the difference in health risk in a managed care plan's membership
in the baseline year compared to the measurement year, and work with the managed care or
county-based purchasing plan to account for differences that they agree are significant.
    The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the
following calendar year if the managed care plan or county-based purchasing plan demonstrates to
the satisfaction of the commissioner that this reduction in the hospitalization rate was achieved.
The commissioner shall structure the withhold so that the commissioner returns a portion of the
withheld funds in amounts commensurate with achieved reductions in utilization less than the
targeted amount.
     The withhold described in this paragraph shall continue until there is a 25 percent reduction
in the hospital admission rate compared to the hospital admission rates in calendar year 2011, as
determined by the commissioner. The hospital admissions in this performance target do not include
the admissions applicable to the subsequent hospital admission performance target under paragraph
(i). Hospitals shall cooperate with the plans in meeting this performance target and shall accept
payment withholds that may be returned to the hospitals if the performance target is achieved.
    (i) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2012, the commissioner shall include as
part of the performance targets described in paragraph (c) a reduction in the plan's hospitalization
admission rates for subsequent hospitalizations within 30 days of a previous hospitalization of a
patient regardless of the reason, for medical assistance and MinnesotaCare enrollees, as determined
by the commissioner. To earn the return of the withhold each year, the managed care plan or
county-based purchasing plan must achieve a qualifying reduction of the subsequent hospitalization
rate for medical assistance and MinnesotaCare enrollees, excluding M   ­­ ed i­­

described in subdivisions 23 and 28, of no less than five percent compared to the previous calendar
year until the final performance target is reached.
    The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the
following calendar year if the managed care plan or county-based purchasing plan demonstrates to
the satisfaction of the commissioner that a qualifying reduction in the subsequent hospitalization
rate was achieved. The commissioner shall structure the withhold so that the commissioner returns
a portion of the withheld funds in amounts commensurate with achieved reductions in utilization
less that the targeted amount.
    The withhold described in this paragraph must continue for each consecutive contract period

   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 256B.69, subdivision 9c, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 9c. Managed care financial reporting. (a) The commissioner shall collect detailed data
regarding financials, provider payments, provider rate methodologies, and other data as determined
by the commissioner and managed care and county-based purchasing plans that are required to
be submitted under this section. The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioners of
health and commerce, and in consultation with managed care plans and county-based purchasing
plans, shall set uniform criteria, definitions, and standards for the data to be submitted, and shall
require managed care and county-based purchasing plans to comply with these criteria, definitions,
and standards when submitting data under this section. In carrying out the responsibilities of this
subdivision, the commissioner shall ensure that the data collection is implemented in an integrated
and coordinated manner that avoids unnecessary duplication of effort. To the extent possible, the
commissioner shall use existing data sources and streamline data collection in order to reduce
public and private sector administrative costs. Nothing in this subdivision shall allow release of
information that is nonpublic data pursuant to section 13.02.
    (b) Each managed care and county-based purchasing plan must annually provide to the
commissioner the following information on state public programs, in the form and manner specified
by the commissioner, according to guidelines developed by the commissioner in consultation with
managed care plans and county-based purchasing plans under contract:
   (1) administrative expenses by category and subcategory consistent with administrative expense
reporting to other state and federal regulatory agencies, by program;
   (2) revenues by program, including investment income;
   (3) nonadministrative service payments, provider payments, and reimbursement rates by
provider type or service category, by program, paid by the managed care plan under this section
or the county-based purchasing plan under section 256B.692 to providers and vendors for
administrative services under contract with the plan, including but not limited to:
   (i) individual-level provider payment and reimbursement rate data;
   (ii) provider reimbursement rate methodologies by provider type, by program, including a
description of alternative payment arrangements and payments outside the claims process;
   (iii) data on implementation of legislatively mandated provider rate changes; and
    (iv) individual-level provider payment and reimbursement rate data and plan-specific provider
reimbursement rate methodologies by provider type, by program, including alternative payment
arrangements and payments outside the claims process, provided to the commissioner under this

subdivision are nonpublic data as defined in section 13.02;
   (4) data on the amount of reinsurance or transfer of risk by program; and
   (5) contribution to reserve, by program.
    (c) In the event a report is published or released based on data provided under this subdivision,
the commissioner shall provide the report to managed care plans and county-based purchasing plans
30 days prior to the publication or release of the report. Managed care plans and county-based
purchasing plans shall have 30 days to review the report and provide comment to the commissioner.
    (d) The legislative auditor shall contract for the audit required under this paragraph. The
legislative auditor shall require, in the request for bids and the resulting contracts for coverage to
be provided under this section, that each managed care and county-based purchasing plan submit
to and fully cooperate with an annual independent third-party financial audit of the information
required under paragraph (b). For purposes of this paragraph, "independent third party" means
an audit firm that is independent in accordance with Government Auditing Standards issued by
the United States Government Accountability Office and licensed in accordance with chapter
326A. In no case shall the audit firm conducting the audit provide services to a managed care or
county-based purchasing plan at the same time as the audit is being conducted or home provided
services to a managed care or county-based purchasing plan during the prior three years.
    (e) The audit of the information required under paragraph (b) shall be conducted by an
independent third-party firm in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards
issued by the United States Government Accountability Office.
    (f) A managed care or county-based purchasing plan that provides services under this section
shall provide to the commissioner biweekly encounter and claims data at a detailed level and shall
participate in a quality assurance program that verifies the timeliness, completeness, accuracy,
and consistency of data provided. The commissioner shall have written protocols for the quality
assurance program that are publicly available. The commissioner shall contract with an independent
third-party auditing firm to evaluate the quality assurance protocols, the capacity of those protocols
to assure complete and accurate data, and the commissioner's implementation of the protocols.
   (g) Contracts awarded under this section to a managed care or county-based purchasing plan
must provide that the commissioner and the contracted auditor shall have unlimited access to any
and all data required to complete the audit and that this access shall be enforceable in a court of
competent jurisdiction through the process of injunctive or other appropriate relief.
    (h) Any actuary or actuarial firm must meet the independence requirements under the
professional code for fellows in the Society of Actuaries when providing actuarial services to the
commissioner in connection with this subdivision and providing services to any managed care
or county-based purchasing plan participating in this subdivision during the term of the actuary's
work for the commissioner under this subdivision.
    (i) The actuary or actuarial firm referenced in paragraph (h) shall certify and attest to the
rates paid to managed care plans and county-based purchasing plans under this section, and the
certification and attestation must be auditable.
  (j) The independent third-party audit shall include a determination of compliance with the federal
Medicaid rate certification process.

   (k) The legislative auditor's contract with the independent third-party auditing firm shall be
designed and administered so as to render the independent third-party audit eligible for a federal
subsidy if available for that purpose. The independent third-party auditing firm shall have the same
powers as the legislative auditor under section 3.978, subdivision 2.
   (l) Upon completion of the audit, and its receipt by the legislative auditor, the legislative auditor
shall provide copies of the audit report to the commissioner, the state auditor, the attorney general,
and the chairs and ranking minority members of the health finance committees of the legislature.
    (m) The commissioner shall annually assess managed care and county-based purchasing plans
for agency costs related to implementing paragraphs (d) to (l), which have been approved as
reasonable by the commissioner of management and budget. The assessment for each plan shall be
in proportion to that plan's share of total medical assistance and MinnesotaCare enrollment under
this section, section 256B.692, and section 256L.12.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
contracts, and the contracting process, for contracts that are effective January 1, 2013, and thereafter.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.69, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9d. Savings from report elimination. Managed care and county-based purchasing plans
shall use all savings resulting from the elimination or modification of reporting requirements to pay
the assessment required by subdivision 9c, paragraph (m).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 256L.12, subdivision 9, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 9. Rate setting; performance withholds. (a) Rates will be prospective, per capita, where
possible. The commissioner may allow health plans to arrange for inpatient hospital services on
a risk or nonrisk basis. The commissioner shall consult with an independent actuary to determine
appropriate rates.
    (b) For services rendered on or after January 1, 2004, the commissioner shall withhold five
percent of managed care plan payments and county-based purchasing plan payments under this
section pending completion of performance targets. Each performance target must be quantifiable,
objective, measurable, and reasonably attainable, except in the case of a performance target based
on a federal or state law or rule. Criteria for assessment of each performance target must be outlined
in writing prior to the contract effective date. Clinical or utilization performance targets and their
related criteria must consider evidence-based research and reasonable interventions, when available
or applicable to the populations served, and must be developed with input from external clinical
experts and stakeholders, including managed care plans and providers. The managed care plan must
demonstrate, to the commissioner's satisfaction, that the data submitted regarding attainment of
the performance target is accurate. The commissioner shall periodically change the administrative
measures used as performance targets in order to improve plan performance across a broader range
of administrative services. The performance targets must include measurement of plan efforts to
contain spending on health care services and administrative activities. The commissioner may adopt
plan-specific performance targets that take into account factors affecting only one plan, such as
characteristics of the plan's enrollee population. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner

contract are achieved.
    (c) For services rendered on or after January 1, 2011, the commissioner shall withhold an
additional three percent of managed care plan or county-based purchasing plan payments under
this section. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31
of the following calendar year. The return of the withhold under this paragraph is not subject to the
requirements of paragraph (b).
    (d) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2011,
the commissioner shall include as part of the performance targets described in paragraph (b) a
reduction in the plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees by
a measurable rate of five percent from the plan's utilization rate for the previous calendar year.
Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2012, the commissioner shall include as part
of the performance targets described in paragraph (b) a reduction in the health plan's emergency
department utilization rate for medical assistance and MinnesotaCare enrollees, as determined
by the commissioner. For 2012, the reductions shall be based on the health plan's utilization
in 2009. To earn the return of the withhold each subsequent year, the managed care plan or
county-based purchasing plan must achieve a qualifying reduction of no less than ten percent of
the plan's utilization rate for medical assistance and MinnesotaCare enrollees, excluding M ­­

performance, the commissioner must consider the difference in health risk in a managed care plan's
membership in the baseline year compared to the measurement year, and work with the managed
care or county-based purchasing plan to account for differences that they agree are significant.
    The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the
following calendar year if the managed care plan or county-based purchasing plan demonstrates
to the satisfaction of the commissioner that a reduction in the utilization rate was achieved.
The commissioner shall structure the withhold so that the commissioner returns a portion of the
withheld funds in amounts commensurate with achieved reductions in utilization less than the
targeted amount.
    The withhold described in this paragraph shall continue for each consecutive contract period

The commissioner shall structure the withhold so that the commissioner returns a portion of the
withheld funds in amounts commensurate with achieved reductions in utilization less than the
targeted amount.
    The withhold described in this paragraph shall continue until there is a 25 percent reduction
in the hospitals admission rate compared to the hospital admission rate for calendar year 2011

described in section 256B.69, subdivisions 23 and 28, of no less than five percent compared to the
previous calendar year until the final performance target is reached.
    The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the
following calendar year if the managed care plan or county-based purchasing plan demonstrates
to the satisfaction of the commissioner that a reduction in the subsequent hospitalization rate was
achieved. The commissioner shall structure the withhold so that the commissioner returns a portion
of the withheld funds in amounts commensurate with achieved reductions in utilization less than
the targeted amount.
    The withhold described in this paragraph must continue for each consecutive contract period
until the plan's subsequent hospitalization rate for medical assistance and MinnesotaCare enrollees is
reduced by 25 percent of the plan's subsequent hospitalization rate for calendar year 2011. Hospitals
shall cooperate with the plans in meeting this performance target and shall accept payment withholds
that must be returned to the hospitals if the performance target is achieved.
    (g) A managed care plan or a county-based purchasing plan under section 256B.692 may include
as admitted assets under section 62D.044 any amount withheld under this section that is reasonably
expected to be returned.
   Sec. 12. COST-SHARING REQUIREMENTS STUDY.
   The commissioner of human services, in consultation with managed care plans, county-based
purchasing plans, and other stakeholders, shall develop recommendations to implement a revised
cost-sharing structure for state public health care programs that ensures application of meaningful

cost-sharing requirements within the limits of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, section 447.54,
for enrollees in these programs. The commissioner shall report to the chairs and ranking minority
members of the legislative committees with jurisdiction over these issues by January 15, 2013, with
draft legislation to implement these recommendations effective January 1, 2014.
   Sec. 13. STUDY OF MANAGED CARE.
    The commissioner of human services must contract with an independent vendor with
demonstrated expertise in evaluating Medicaid managed care programs to evaluate the value of
managed care for state public health care programs provided under Minnesota Statutes, sections
256B.69, 256B.692, and 256L.12. The evaluation must be completed and reported to the legislature
by January 15, 2013. Determination of the value of managed care must include consideration of
the following, as compared to a fee-for-service program:
   (1) the satisfaction of state public health care program recipients and providers;
   (2) the ability to measure and improve health outcomes of recipients;
   (3) the access to health services for recipients;
  (4) the availability of additional services such as care coordination, case management, disease
management, transportation, and after-hours nurse lines;
   (5) actual and potential cost savings to the state;
   (6) the level of alignment with state and federal health reform policies, including a health benefit
exchange for individuals not enrolled in state public health care programs; and
   (7) the ability to use different provider payment models that provide incentives for cost-effective
health care.
   Sec. 14. STUDY OF FOR-PROFIT HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS.
    The commissioner of health shall contract with an entity with expertise in health economics
and health care delivery and quality to study the efficiency, costs, service quality, and enrollee
satisfaction of for-profit health maintenance organizations, relative to not-for-profit health
maintenance organizations operating in Minnesota and other states. The study findings must
address whether the state could: (1) reduce medical assistance and MinnesotaCare costs and
costs of providing coverage to state employees; and (2) maintain or improve the quality of care
provided to state health care program enrollees and state employees if for-profit health maintenance
organizations were allowed to operate in the state. In comparing for-profit health maintenance
organizations operating in other states with not-for-profit health maintenance organizations
operating in Minnesota, the entity must consider differences in regulatory oversight, benefit
requirements, network standards, human resource costs, and assessments, fees, and taxes that may
impact the cost and quality comparisons. The commissioner shall require the entity under contract
to report study findings to the commissioner and the legislature by January 15, 2013.
   Sec. 15. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   Subdivision 1. Evidence-based childbirth program. The commissioner of human services
may discontinue the evidence-based childbirth program and shall discontinue all affiliated reporting
requirements established under Minnesota Statutes, section 256B.0625, subdivision 3g, once

the commissioner determines that hospitals representing at least 90 percent of births covered by
Medical Assistance or MinnesotaCare have approved policies and processes in place that prohibit
elective inductions prior to 39 weeks' gestation.
    Subd. 2. Provider networks. The commissioner of health, the commissioner of commerce, and
the commissioner of human services shall merge reporting requirements for health maintenance
organizations and county-based purchasing plans related to Minnesota Department of Health
oversight of network adequacy under Minnesota Statutes, section 62D.124, and the provider
network list reported to the Department of Human Services under Minnesota Rules, part 4685.2100.
The commissioners shall work with health maintenance organizations and county-based purchasing
plans to ensure that the report merger is done in a manner that simplifies health maintenance
organization and county-based purchasing plan reporting processes.

   Subd. 6. Supplemental benefits. (a) A health maintenance organization may, as a supplemental
benefit, provide coverage to its enrollees for health care services and supplies received from
providers who are not employed by, under contract with, or otherwise affiliated with the health
maintenance organization. Supplemental benefits may be provided if the following conditions are
met:
   (1) a health maintenance organization desiring to offer supplemental benefits must at all times
comply with the requirements of sections 62D.041 and 62D.042;
    (2) a health maintenance organization offering supplemental benefits must maintain an
additional surplus in the first year supplemental benefits are offered equal to the lesser of $500,000
or 33 percent of the supplemental benefit expenses. At the end of the second year supplemental

benefits are offered, the health maintenance organization must maintain an additional surplus equal
to the lesser of $1,000,000 or 33 percent of the supplemental benefit expenses. At the end of the
third year benefits are offered and every year after that, the health maintenance organization must
maintain an additional surplus equal to the greater of $1,000,000 or 33 percent of the supplemental
benefit expenses. When in the judgment of the commissioner the health maintenance organization's
surplus is inadequate, the commissioner may require the health maintenance organization to
maintain additional surplus;
   (3) claims relating to supplemental benefits must be processed in accordance with the
requirements of section 72A.201; and
   (4) in marketing supplemental benefits, the health maintenance organization shall fully disclose
and describe to enrollees and potential enrollees the nature and extent of the supplemental coverage,
and any claims filing and other administrative responsibilities in regard to supplemental benefits.
     (b) The commissioner may, pursuant to chapter 14, adopt, enforce, and administer rules
relating to this subdivision, including: rules insuring that these benefits are supplementary and not
substitutes for comprehensive health maintenance services by addressing percentage of out-of-plan
coverage; rules relating to the establishment of necessary financial reserves; rules relating to
marketing practices; and other rules necessary for the effective and efficient administration of this

    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 62Q.80, is amended to read:
    62Q.80 COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Scope. (a) Any community-based health care initiative may develop and
operate community-based health care coverage programs that offer to eligible individuals and
their dependents the option of purchasing through their employer health care coverage on a fixed
prepaid basis without meeting the requirements of chapter 60A, 62A, 62C, 62D, 62M, 62N, 62Q,
62T, or 62U, or any other law or rule that applies to entities licensed under these chapters.
    (b) Each initiative shall establish health outcomes to be achieved through the programs and
performance measurements in order to determine whether these outcomes have been met. The
outcomes must include, but are not limited to:
   (1) a reduction in uncompensated care provided by providers participating in the
community-based health network;

     (2) an increase in the delivery of preventive health care services; and
    (3) health improvement for enrollees with chronic health conditions through the management of
these conditions.
In establishing performance measurements, the initiative shall use measures that are consistent with
measures published by nonprofit Minnesota or national organizations that produce and disseminate
health care quality measures.
    (c) Any program established under this section shall not constitute a financial liability for the
state, in that any financial risk involved in the operation or termination of the program shall be borne
by the community-based initiative and the participating health care providers.

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 62U.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Calculation of health care costs and quality. The commissioner of health shall
develop a uniform method of calculating providers' relative cost of care, defined as a measure
of health care spending including resource use and unit prices, and relative quality of care. In
developing this method, the commissioner must address the following issues:
   (1) provider attribution of costs and quality;
   (2) appropriate adjustment for outlier or catastrophic cases;
   (3) appropriate risk adjustment to reflect differences in the demographics and health status
across provider patient populations, using generally accepted and transparent risk adjustment
methodologies and case mix adjustment;
   (4) specific types of providers that should be included in the calculation;
   (5) specific types of services that should be included in the calculation;
   (6) appropriate adjustment for variation in payment rates;
   (7) the appropriate provider level for analysis;
    (8) payer mix adjustments, including variation across providers in the percentage of revenue
received from government programs; and

   (1) the results, data, and summaries, including any graphical depictions of provider performance,
have been distributed to providers at least 120 days prior to publication;
   (2) the commissioner has provided an opportunity for providers to verify and review data for
which the provider is the subject consistent with the recommendations developed pursuant to
subdivision 3c, paragraph (d), and adopted by the commissioner;
   (3) the results meet thresholds of validity, reliability, statistical significance, representativeness,
and other standards that reflect the recommendations of the advisory committee, established under
subdivision 3; and
    (4) any public report or other usage of the analyses, report, or data used by the state clearly
notifies consumers about how to use and interpret the results, including any limitations of the data
and analysis.
   ­(g
     ­­) (c) After publishing the first public report, the commissioner shall, no less frequently than
annually, publish information on providers' total cost, total resource use, total quality, and the
results of the total care portion of the peer grouping process, as well as information on providers'
condition-specific cost, condition-specific resource use, and condition-specific quality, and the
results of the condition-specific portion of the peer grouping process. The results that are published
must be on a risk-adjusted basis, including case mix adjustments.
    (d) The commissioner shall convene a work group comprised of representatives of physician
clinics, hospitals, their respective statewide associations, and other relevant stakeholder
organizations to make recommendations on data to be made available to hospitals and physician
clinics to allow for verification of the accuracy and representativeness of the provider peer grouping
results.

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256D.06, subdivision 1b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1b. Earned income savings account. In addition to the $50 disregard required under
subdivision 1, the county agency shall disregard an additional earned income up to a maximum
of $­1
     ­5­0
        ­ $500 per month for: (1) persons residing in facilities licensed under Minnesota Rules,
parts 9520.0500 to 9520.0690 and 9530.2500 to 9530.4000, and for whom discharge and work
are part of a treatment plan; (2) persons living in supervised apartments with services funded under
Minnesota Rules, parts 9535.0100 to 9535.1600, and for whom discharge and work are part of a
treatment plan; and (3) persons residing in group residential housing, as that term is defined in
section 256I.03, subdivision 3, for whom the county agency has approved a discharge plan which
includes work. The additional amount disregarded must be placed in a separate savings account by
the eligible individual, to be used upon discharge from the residential facility into the community.
For individuals residing in a chemical dependency program licensed under Minnesota Rules, part
9530.4100, subpart 22, item D, withdrawals from the savings account require the signature of the
individual and for those individuals with an authorized representative payee, the signature of the
payee. A maximum of $   ­1­­0
                           ,­­ 0 $2,000, including interest, of the money in the savings account must
                              0­
be excluded from the resource limits established by section 256D.08, subdivision 1, clause (1).
Amounts in that account in excess of $  ­­1­0
                                           ,­0 0 $2,000 must be applied to the resident's cost of care.
                                              ­­
If excluded money is removed from the savings account by the eligible individual at any time
before the individual is discharged from the facility into the community, the money is income to
the individual in the month of receipt and a resource in subsequent months. If an eligible individual
moves from a community facility to an inpatient hospital setting, the separate savings account is
an excluded asset for up to 18 months. During that time, amounts that accumulate in excess of the
­1
$ ­­0
   ,­0­0
       ­ $2,000 savings limit must be applied to the patient's cost of care. If the patient continues to
be hospitalized at the conclusion of the 18-month period, the entire account must be applied to the
patient's cost of care.

license holders. The certification shall be printed on the license, and identified on the commissioner's
public Web site.
   (b) The requirements for certification are:
    (1) all staff working in the adult foster care home have received at least seven hours of annual

   (i) mental health diagnoses;
   (ii) mental health crisis response and de-escalation techniques;

commissioner, and the commissioner will remove the certification.
    (e) A denial of the certification or the removal of the certification based on a determination
that the requirements under paragraph (b) have not been met by the adult foster care license holder

certification removed may again request certification when the license holder is in compliance with
the requirements of paragraph (b).
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 245A.03, subdivision 7, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 7. Licensing moratorium. (a) The commissioner shall not issue an initial license for

licensed under Minnesota Rules, parts 9555.5105 to 9555.6265, under this chapter for a physical
location that will not be the primary residence of the license holder for the entire period of licensure.
If a license is issued during this moratorium, and the license holder changes the license holder's
primary residence away from the physical location of the foster care license, the commissioner shall
revoke the license according to section 245A.07. Exceptions to the moratorium include:
   (1) foster care settings that are required to be registered under chapter 144D;
    (2) foster care licenses replacing foster care licenses in existence on May 15, 2009, and
determined to be needed by the commissioner under paragraph (b);

for persons requiring hospital level care; or
   (5) new foster care licenses determined to be needed by the commissioner for the transition of

    (b) The commissioner shall determine the need for newly licensed foster care homes as defined
under this subdivision. As part of the determination, the commissioner shall consider the availability
of foster care capacity in the area in which the licensee seeks to operate, and the recommendation
of the local county board. The determination by the commissioner must be final. A determination
of need is not required for a change in ownership at the same address.
    (c) Residential settings that would otherwise be subject to the moratorium established in
paragraph (a), that are in the process of receiving an adult or child foster care license as of July
1, 2009, shall be allowed to continue to complete the process of receiving an adult or child foster
care license. For this paragraph, all of the following conditions must be met to be considered in the
process of receiving an adult or child foster care license:

documentation in each participant's care plan;
   (2) the provider has purchased housing or has made a financial investment in the property;
    (3) the lead agency has approved the plans, including costs for the residential setting for each
individual;
   (4) the completion of the licensing process, including all necessary inspections, is the only
remaining component prior to being able to provide services; and

To qualify for the process under this paragraph, the lead agency must submit documentation to the
commissioner by August 1, 2009, that all of the above criteria are met.
   (d) The commissioner shall study the effects of the license moratorium under this subdivision
and shall report back to the legislature by January 15, 2011. This study shall include, but is not

primary residence of the license holder prior to and after implementation of the moratorium; and
   (3) the number of licensed and occupied ICF/MR beds prior to and after implementation of the
moratorium.
    (e) When a foster care recipient moves out of a foster home that is not the primary residence
of the license holder according to section 256B.49, subdivision 15, paragraph (f), the county shall
immediately inform the Department of Human Services Licensing Division,         ­­

in paragraph (f) are not sufficient to meet the savings required by 2011 reductions in licensed bed
capacity and maintain statewide long-term care residential services capacity within budgetary
limits. The commissioner shall delicense up to 128 beds by June 30, 2013, using the needs
determination process. Under this paragraph, the commissioner has the authority to reduce unused
licensed capacity of a current foster care program to accomplish the consolidation or closure of
settings. A decreased licensed capacity according to this paragraph is not subject to appeal under
this chapter.
    (f) Residential settings that would otherwise be subject to the decreased license capacity
established in paragraph (e) shall be exempt under the following circumstances:
   (1) until August 1, 2013, the beds of a license holder whose primary diagnosis is mental illness

parts 9520.0500 to 9520.0670; or
   (2) the license holder is certified under the requirements in subdivision 6a.
    (g) A resource need determination process, managed at the state level, using the available reports
required by section 144A.351, and other data and information shall be used to determine where the
reduced capacity required under paragraph (e) will be implemented. The commissioner shall consult
with the stakeholders described in section 144A.351, and employ a variety of methods to improve
the state's capacity to meet long-term care service needs within budgetary limits, including seeking
proposals from service providers or lead agencies to change service type, capacity, or location to
improve services, increase the independence of residents, and better meet needs identified by the
long-term care services reports and statewide data and information. By February 1 of each year,
the commissioner shall provide information and data on the overall capacity of licensed long-term
care services, actions taken under this subdivision to manage statewide long-term care services
and supports resources, and any recommendations for change to the legislative committees with
jurisdiction over health and human services budget.

    (c) The commissioner may grant variances to paragraph (b) to allow a foster care provider with a
licensed capacity of five persons to admit an individual under the age of 55 if the variance complies
with section 245A.04, subdivision 9, and approval of the variance is recommended by the county
in which the licensed foster care provider is located.
    (d) The commissioner may grant variances to paragraph (b) to allow the use of a fifth bed for
emergency crisis services for a person with serious and persistent mental illness or a developmental
disability, regardless of age, if the variance complies with section 245A.04, subdivision 9, and
approval of the variance is recommended by the county in which the licensed foster care provider
is located.
     (e) The commissioner may grant a variance to paragraph (b) to allow for the use of a fifth bed

documentation verifying that:
   (1) the county has approved the license holder's plan for alternative methods of providing
overnight supervision and determined the plan protects the residents' health, safety, and rights;
   (2) the license holder has obtained written and signed informed consent from each resident or
each resident's legal representative documenting the resident's or legal representative's agreement

licensing sanction issued under section 245A.07 during the prior 24 months based on failure to
provide adequate supervision, health care services, or resident safety in the adult foster care home.
    (c) A license holder requesting a variance under this subdivision to utilize technology as a
component of a plan for alternative overnight supervision may request the commissioner's review
in the absence of a county recommendation. Upon receipt of such a request from a license holder,
the commissioner shall review the variance request with the county.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 245A.11, subdivision 7a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7a. Alternate overnight supervision technology; adult foster care license. (a) The
commissioner may grant an applicant or license holder an adult foster care license for a residence that
does not have a caregiver in the residence during normal sleeping hours as required under Minnesota
Rules, part 9555.5105, subpart 37, item B, but uses monitoring technology to alert the license holder
when an incident occurs that may jeopardize the health, safety, or rights of a foster care recipient.
The applicant or license holder must comply with all other requirements under Minnesota Rules,
parts 9555.5105 to 9555.6265, and the requirements under this subdivision. The license printed by
the commissioner must state in bold and large font:
   (1) that the facility is under electronic monitoring; and
   (2) the telephone number of the county's common entry point for making reports of suspected
maltreatment of vulnerable adults under section 626.557, subdivision 9.
    (b) Applications for a license under this section must be submitted directly to the Department of
Human Services licensing division. The licensing division must immediately notify the host county
and lead county contract agency and the host county licensing agency. The licensing division must
collaborate with the county licensing agency in the review of the application and the licensing of
the program.
    (c) Before a license is issued by the commissioner, and for the duration of the license, the
applicant or license holder must establish, maintain, and document the implementation of written
policies and procedures addressing the requirements in paragraphs (d) through (f).
   (d) The applicant or license holder must have policies and procedures that:

   (1) establish characteristics of target populations that will be admitted into the home, and
characteristics of populations that will not be accepted into the home;
   (2) explain the discharge process when a foster care recipient requires overnight supervision or
other services that cannot be provided by the license holder due to the limited hours that the license
holder is on site;
   (3) describe the types of events to which the program will respond with a physical presence
when those events occur in the home during time when staff are not on site, and how the license
holder's response plan meets the requirements in paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2);
    (4) establish a process for documenting a review of the implementation and effectiveness
of the response protocol for the response required under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2). The
documentation must include:
   (i) a description of the triggering incident;
   (ii) the date and time of the triggering incident;
   (iii) the time of the response or responses under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2);
   (iv) whether the response met the resident's needs;
   (v) whether the existing policies and response protocols were followed; and
   (vi) whether the existing policies and protocols are adequate or need modification.
    When no physical presence response is completed for a three-month period, the license holder's
written policies and procedures must require a physical presence response drill to be conducted
for which the effectiveness of the response protocol under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2), will be
reviewed and documented as required under this clause; and
    (5) establish that emergency and nonemergency phone numbers are posted in a prominent
location in a common area of the home where they can be easily observed by a person responding
to an incident who is not otherwise affiliated with the home.
    (e) The license holder must document and include in the license application which response
alternative under clause (1) or (2) is in place for responding to situations that present a serious risk
to the health, safety, or rights of people receiving foster care services in the home:
    (1) response alternative (1) requires only the technology to provide an electronic notification or
alert to the license holder that an event is underway that requires a response. Under this alternative,
no more than ten minutes will pass before the license holder will be physically present on site to
respond to the situation; or
    (2) response alternative (2) requires the electronic notification and alert system under alternative
(1), but more than ten minutes may pass before the license holder is present on site to respond to
the situation. Under alternative (2), all of the following conditions are met:
    (i) the license holder has a written description of the interactive technological applications that
will assist the license holder in communicating with and assessing the needs related to the care,
health, and safety of the foster care recipients. This interactive technology must permit the license
5360                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                     [96TH DAY

holder to remotely assess the well being of the foster care recipient without requiring the initiation
of the foster care recipient. Requiring the foster care recipient to initiate a telephone call does not
meet this requirement;
    (ii) the license holder documents how the remote license holder is qualified and capable of
meeting the needs of the foster care recipients and assessing foster care recipients' needs under

    (h) The commissioner may grant variances to the requirements of this section according to
section 245A.04, subdivision 9.
    (i) For the purposes of paragraphs (d) through (h), "license holder" has the meaning under section
245A.2, subdivision 9, and additionally includes all staff, volunteers, and contractors affiliated with
the license holder.

shall provide the applicant written notice that the application is incomplete or substantially
deficient. In the written notice to the applicant, the commissioner shall identify documents that
are missing or deficient and give the applicant 45 days to resubmit a second application that is

representative of the right to an individual service plan and the right to appeal under section 256.045;
                                                                                                       ­.

household with two family members, husband and wife, or parent and child, the household must
not own more than $6,000 in assets, plus $200 for each additional legal dependent. In addition to
these maximum amounts, an eligible individual or family may accrue interest on these amounts,
but they must be reduced to the maximum at the time of an eligibility redetermination. The
accumulation of the clothing and personal needs allowance according to section 256B.35 must
also be reduced to the maximum at the time of the eligibility redetermination. The value of assets

earnings, assets allowed while eligible for medical assistance under section 256B.057, subdivision
9, are not considered for 12 months, beginning with the first month of ineligibility as an employed
person with a disability, to the extent that the person's total assets remain within the allowed limits

company, common carrier, or other recognized providers of transportation services. Medical
transportation must be provided by:
   (1) an ambulance, as defined in section 144E.001, subdivision 2;
   (2) special transportation; or
    (3) common carrier including, but not limited to, bus, taxicab, other commercial carrier, or
private automobile.
    (b) Medical assistance covers special transportation, as defined in Minnesota Rules, part
9505.0315, subpart 1, item F, if the recipient has a physical or mental impairment that would
prohibit the recipient from safely accessing and using a bus, taxi, other commercial transportation,
or private automobile.
The commissioner may use an order by the recipient's attending physician to certify that the
recipient requires special transportation services. Special transportation providers shall perform
driver-assisted services for eligible individuals. Driver-assisted service includes passenger pickup
at and return to the individual's residence or place of business, assistance with admittance of
the individual to the medical facility, and assistance in passenger securement or in securing of
wheelchairs or stretchers in the vehicle. Special transportation providers must obtain written
documentation from the health care service provider who is serving the recipient being transported,
identifying the time that the recipient arrived. Special transportation providers may not bill
for separate base rates for the continuation of a trip beyond the original destination. Special
transportation providers must take recipients to the nearest appropriate health care provider,
using the most direct route. The minimum medical assistance reimbursement rates for special
transportation services are:
   (1)(i) $17 for the base rate and $1.35 per mile for special transportation services to eligible
persons who need a wheelchair-accessible van;
   (ii) $11.50 for the base rate and $1.30 per mile for special transportation services to eligible
persons who do not need a wheelchair-accessible van; and
    (iii) $60 for the base rate and $2.40 per mile, and an attendant rate of $9 per trip, for special
transportation services to eligible persons who need a stretcher-accessible vehicle;
    (2) the base rates for special transportation services in areas defined under RUCA to be super
rural shall be equal to the reimbursement rate established in clause (1) plus 11.3 percent; and
    (3) for special transportation services in areas defined under RUCA to be rural or super rural
areas:
    (i) for a trip equal to 17 miles or less, mileage reimbursement shall be equal to 125 percent of
the respective mileage rate in clause (1); and
    (ii) for a trip between 18 and 50 miles, mileage reimbursement shall be equal to 112.5 percent
of the respective mileage rate in clause (1).
    (c) For purposes of reimbursement rates for special transportation services under paragraph (b),
the zip code of the recipient's place of residence shall determine whether the urban, rural, or super

rural reimbursement rate applies.
    (d) For purposes of this subdivision, "rural urban commuting area" or "RUCA" means a
census-tract based classification system under which a geographical area is determined to be urban,
rural, or super rural.
    (e) Effective for services provided on or after September 1, 2011, nonemergency transportation
rates, including special transportation, taxi, and other commercial carriers, are reduced 4.5 percent.
Payments made to managed care plans and county-based purchasing plans must be reduced for
services provided on or after January 1, 2012, to reflect this reduction.
    (f) Outside of a metropolitan county as defined in section 473.121, subdivision 4, reimbursement
rates under this subdivision may be adjusted monthly by the commissioner when the statewide
average price of regular grade gasoline is over $3 per gallon, as calculated by Oil Price Information
Service. The rate adjustment shall be a one-percent increase or decrease for each corresponding
$0.10 increase or decrease in the statewide average price of regular grade gasoline.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 256B.0631, subdivision 2, is amended to

    Subd. 3. State Quality Council. (a) There is hereby created a State Quality Council which must
define regional quality councils, and carry out a community-based, person-directed quality review
component, and a comprehensive system for effective incident reporting, investigation, analysis,
and follow-up.
    (b) By August 1, 2011, the commissioner of human services shall appoint the members of the
initial State Quality Council. Members shall include representatives from the following groups:
   (1) disability service recipients and their family members;
    (2) during the first two years of the State Quality Council, there must be at least three members
from the Region 10 stakeholders. As regional quality councils are formed under subdivision 4, each
regional quality council shall appoint one member;
   (3) disability service providers;
   (4) disability advocacy groups; and
  (5) county human services agencies and staff from the Department of Human Services and
Ombudsman for Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities.
   (c) Members of the council who do not receive a salary or wages from an employer for time spent

    (3) identify issues pertaining to financial and personal risk that impede Minnesotans with
disabilities from optimizing choice of community-based services; and
    (4) recommend to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees with
jurisdiction over human services and civil law by January 15, 2013, statutory and rule changes
related to the findings under clause (3) that promote individualized service and housing choices
balanced with appropriate individualized protection.
      (e) The State Quality Council, in partnership with the commissioner, shall:
    (1) approve and direct implementation of the community-based, person-directed system
established in this section;
    (2) recommend an appropriate method of funding this system, and determine the feasibility of
the use of Medicaid, licensing fees, as well as other possible funding options;
   (3) approve measurable outcomes in the areas of health and safety, consumer evaluation,
education and training, providers, and systems;
      (4) establish variable licensure periods not to exceed three years based on outcomes achieved;

review process for the system. The review shall take into account the comprehensive nature of the

provide services to persons with disabilities. The review shall address efficiencies and effectiveness
of the system.
    (h) The State Quality Council may recommend to the commissioner certain variances from the
standards governing licensure of programs for persons with disabilities in order to improve the
quality of services so long as the recommended variances do not adversely affect the health or
safety of persons being served or compromise the qualifications of staff to provide services.
   (i) The safety standards, rights, or procedural protections referenced under subdivision 2,
paragraph (c), shall not be varied. The State Quality Council may make recommendations to the
commissioner or to the legislature in the report required under paragraph (c) regarding alternatives
or modifications to the safety standards, rights, or procedural protections referenced under
subdivision 2, paragraph (c).
      (j) The State Quality Council may hire staff to perform the duties assigned in this subdivision.

Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0060, subpart 11, item C, subitem (2), for a total replacement, as defined
96TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 29, 2012                                          5373

in subdivision 17d, authorized under section 144A.071 or 144A.073 after July 1, 1999, any building
project that is a relocation, renovation, upgrading, or conversion completed on or after July 1,
2001, or any building project eligible for reimbursement under section 256B.434, subdivision 4f,
the replacement-costs-new per bed limit shall be $74,280 per licensed bed in multiple-bed rooms,
$92,850 per licensed bed in semiprivate rooms with a fixed partition separating the resident beds,
and $111,420 per licensed bed in single rooms. Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0060, subpart 11, item
C, subitem (2), does not apply. These amounts must be adjusted annually as specified in subdivision
3f, paragraph (a), beginning January 1, 2000. These amounts must be increased annually as specified
in subdivision 3f, paragraph (a), beginning October 1, 2012.
   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.431, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 45. Rate adjustments for some moratorium exception projects. Notwithstanding
any other law to the contrary, money available for moratorium exception projects under section
144A.073, subdivisions 2 and 11, shall be used to fund the incremental rate increases resulting
from this section for any nursing facility with a moratorium exception project approved under
section 144A.073, and completed after August 30, 2010, where the replacement-costs-new limits
under subdivision 17e were higher at any time after project approval than at the time of project
completion. The commissioner shall calculate the property rate increase for these facilities using
the highest set of limits; however, any rate increase under this section shall not be effective until
on or after the effective date of this section, contingent upon federal approval. No property rate
decrease shall result from this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective upon federal approval.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.434, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Exemptions. (a) To the extent permitted by federal law, (1) a facility that has entered
into a contract under this section is not required to file a cost report, as defined in Minnesota Rules,
part 9549.0020, subpart 13, for any year after the base year that is the basis for the calculation of
the contract payment rate for the first rate year of the alternative payment demonstration project
contract; and (2) a facility under contract is not subject to audits of historical costs or revenues, or
paybacks or retroactive adjustments based on these costs or revenues, except audits, paybacks, or
adjustments relating to the cost report that is the basis for calculation of the first rate year under the
contract.
    (b) A facility that is under contract with the commissioner under this section is not subject
to the moratorium on licensure or certification of new nursing home beds in section 144A.071,
unless the project results in a net increase in bed capacity or involves relocation of beds from
one site to another. Contract payment rates must not be adjusted to reflect any additional costs
that a nursing facility incurs as a result of a construction project undertaken under this paragraph.
In addition, as a condition of entering into a contract under this section, a nursing facility must
agree that any future medical assistance payments for nursing facility services will not reflect any
additional costs attributable to the sale of a nursing facility under this section and to construction
undertaken under this paragraph that otherwise would not be authorized under the moratorium in
section 144A.073. Nothing in this section prevents a nursing facility participating in the alternative
payment demonstration project under this section from seeking approval of an exception to the
moratorium through the process established in section 144A.073, and if approved the facility's rates
shall be adjusted to reflect the cost of the project. Nothing in this section prevents a nursing facility

participating in the alternative payment demonstration project from seeking legislative approval of
an exception to the moratorium under section 144A.071, and, if enacted, the facility's rates shall be
adjusted to reflect the cost of the project.

      ) (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), if by April 1, 1996, the health care financing
administration has not approved a required waiver, or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services otherwise requires cost reports to be filed prior to the waiver's approval, the commissioner
shall require a cost report for the rate year.

      ) (d) A facility that is under contract with the commissioner under this section shall be allowed
to change therapy arrangements from an unrelated vendor to a related vendor during the term of the
contract. The commissioner may develop reasonable requirements designed to prevent an increase
in therapy utilization for residents enrolled in the medical assistance program.

     ) (e) Nursing facilities participating in the alternative payment system demonstration project
must either participate in the alternative payment system quality improvement program established
by the commissioner or submit information on their own quality improvement process to the
commissioner for approval. Nursing facilities that have had their own quality improvement process
approved by the commissioner must report results for at least one key area of quality improvement
annually to the commissioner.
     Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.441, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 63. Critical access nursing facilities. (a) The commissioner, in consultation with the
commissioner of health, may designate certain nursing facilities as critical access nursing facilities.
The designation shall be granted on a competitive basis, within the limits of funds appropriated for
this purpose.
    (b) The commissioner shall request proposals from nursing facilities every two years. Proposals
must be submitted in the form and according to the timelines established by the commissioner. In
selecting applicants to designate, the commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of health,
and with input from stakeholders, shall develop criteria designed to preserve access to nursing
facility services in isolated areas, rebalance long-term care, and improve quality.
    (c) The commissioner shall allow the benefits in clauses (1) to (5) for nursing facilities designated
as critical access nursing facilities:
    (1) partial rebasing, with operating payment rates being the sum of 60 percent of the operating
payment rate determined in accordance with subdivision 54 and 40 percent of the operating payment
rate that would have been allowed had the facility not been designated;
    (2) enhanced payments for leave days. Notwithstanding section 256B.431, subdivision 2r, upon
designation as a critical access nursing facility, the commissioner shall limit payment for leave days
to 60 percent of that nursing facility's total payment rate for the involved resident, and shall allow
this payment only when the occupancy of the nursing facility, inclusive of bed hold days, is equal
to or greater than 90 percent;

    (3) two designated critical access nursing facilities, with up to 100 beds in active service, may
jointly apply to the commissioner of health for a waiver of Minnesota Rules, part 4658.0500, subpart
2, in order to jointly employ a director of nursing. The commissioner of health will consider each
waiver request independently based on the criteria under Minnesota Rules, part 4658.0040;
   (4) the minimum threshold under section 256B.431, subdivisions 3f, paragraph (a), and 17e,
shall be 40 percent of the amount that would otherwise apply; and
   (5) notwithstanding subdivision 58, beginning October 1, 2014, the quality-based rate limits
under subdivision 50 shall apply to designated critical access nursing facilities.
    (d) Designation of a critical access nursing facility shall be for a period of two years, after
which the benefits allowed under paragraph (c) shall be removed. Designated facilities may apply
for continued designation.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.48, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6a. Referrals to Medicare providers required. Notwithstanding subdivision 1, nursing
facility providers that do not participate in or accept Medicare assignment must refer and document
the referral of dual eligible recipients for whom placement is requested and for whom the resident
would be qualified for a Medicare-covered stay to Medicare providers. The commissioner shall
audit nursing facilities that do not accept Medicare and determine if dual eligible individuals with
Medicare qualifying stays have been admitted. If such a determination is made, the commissioner
shall deny Medicaid payment for the first 20 days of that resident's stay.
   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 256B.49, subdivision 15, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 15. Individualized service plan; comprehensive transitional service plan;
maintenance service plan. (a) Each recipient of home and community-based waivered services
shall be provided a copy of the written service plan which:
    (1) is developed and signed by the recipient within ten working days of the completion of the
assessment;
   (2) meets the assessed needs of the recipient;
   (3) reasonably ensures the health and safety of the recipient;
   (4) promotes independence;
   (5) allows for services to be provided in the most integrated settings; and
    (6) provides for an informed choice, as defined in section 256B.77, subdivision 2, paragraph (p),
of service and support providers.
   (b) In developing the comprehensive transitional service plan, the individual receiving services,
the case manager, and the guardian, if applicable, will identify the transitional service plan
fundamental service outcome and anticipated timeline to achieve this outcome. Within the first
20 days following a recipient's request for an assessment or reassessment, the transitional service

planning team must be identified. A team leader must be identified who will be responsible for
assigning responsibility and communicating with team members to ensure implementation of the
transition plan and ongoing assessment and communication process. The team leader should be an
individual, such as the case manager or guardian, who has the opportunity to follow the recipient
to the next level of service.
    Within ten days following an assessment, a comprehensive transitional service plan must
be developed incorporating elements of a comprehensive functional assessment and including
short-term measurable outcomes and timelines for achievement of and reporting on these outcomes.
Functional milestones must also be identified and reported according to the timelines agreed upon
by the transitional service planning team. In addition, the comprehensive transitional service plan
must identify additional supports that may assist in the achievement of the fundamental service
outcome such as the development of greater natural community support, increased collaboration
among agencies, and technological supports.
     The timelines for reporting on functional milestones will prompt a reassessment of services
provided, the units of services, rates, and appropriate service providers. It is the responsibility of
the transitional service planning team leader to review functional milestone reporting to determine
if the milestones are consistent with observable skills and that milestone achievement prompts any
needed changes to the comprehensive transitional service plan.
    For those whose fundamental transitional service outcome involves the need to procure housing,
a plan for the recipient to seek the resources necessary to secure the least restrictive housing possible
should be incorporated into the plan, including employment and public supports such as housing
access and shelter needy funding.
    (c) Counties and other agencies responsible for funding community placement and ongoing
community supportive services are responsible for the implementation of the comprehensive
transitional service plans. Oversight responsibilities include both ensuring effective transitional
service delivery and efficient utilization of funding resources.
    (d) Following one year of transitional services, the transitional services planning team will make
a determination as to whether or not the individual receiving services requires the current level of
continuous and consistent support in order to maintain the recipient's current level of functioning.
Recipients who are determined to have not had a significant change in functioning for 12 months
must move from a transitional to a maintenance service plan. Recipients on a maintenance service
plan must be reassessed to determine if the recipient would benefit from a transitional service plan at
least every 12 months and at other times when there has been a significant change in the recipient's
functioning. This assessment should consider any changes to technological or natural community
supports.
    (e) When a county is evaluating denials, reductions, or terminations of home and
community-based services under section 256B.49 for an individual, the case manager shall offer
to meet with the individual or the individual's guardian in order to discuss the prioritization of
service needs within the individualized service plan, comprehensive transitional service plan, or
maintenance service plan. The reduction in the authorized services for an individual due to changes
in funding for waivered services may not exceed the amount needed to ensure medically necessary
services to meet the individual's health, safety, and welfare.
   (f) At the time of reassessment, local agency case managers shall assess each recipient of

community alternatives for disabled individuals or traumatic brain injury waivered services
currently residing in a licensed adult foster home that is not the primary residence of the license
holder, or in which the license holder is not the primary caregiver, to determine if that recipient
could appropriately be served in a community-living setting. If appropriate for the recipient, the
case manager shall offer the recipient, through a person-centered planning process, the option
to receive alternative housing and service options. In the event that the recipient chooses to
transfer from the adult foster home, the vacated bed shall not be filled with another recipient of
waiver services and group residential housing,           ­u­­n­e

agreement, or has a plan for transition of a lease from a service provider to the individual. Within
two years of signing the initial lease, the service provider shall transfer the lease to the individual.

sufficient time to ensure the continued occupancy by the individual. Community-living settings are
subject to the following:
    (1) individuals are not required to receive services;
   (2) individuals are not required to have a disability or specific diagnosis to live in the
community-living setting, unless state or federal funding requires it;
    (3) individuals may hire service providers of their choice;
    (4) individuals may choose whether to share their household and with whom;
    (5) the home or apartment must include living, sleeping, bathing, and cooking areas;
    (6) individuals must have lockable access and egress;
    (7) individuals must be free to receive visitors and leave the settings at times and for durations
of their own choosing;
    (8) leases must not reserve the right to assign units or change unit assignments; and
   (9) access to the greater community must be easily facilitated based on the individual's needs
and preferences.

5378                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [96TH DAY

    Subdivision 1. Commissioner's duties; report. The commissioner of human services shall ask
providers of adult foster care services to present proposals for the conversion of services provided for
persons with developmental disabilities in settings licensed under Minnesota Rules, parts 9555.5105
to 9555.6265, to services to other community settings in conjunction with the cessation of operations
and closure of identified facilities.
    Subd. 2. Inventory of foster care capacity. The commissioner of human services shall submit
to the legislature by February 15, 2013, a report that includes:
    (1) an inventory of the assessed needs of all individuals with disabilities receiving foster care
services under section 256B.092;
   (2) an inventory of total licensed foster care capacity for adults and children available in
Minnesota as of January 1, 2013; and
   (3) a comparison of the needs of individuals receiving services in foster care settings and
nonfoster care settings.
The report will also contain recommendations on developing a profile of individuals requiring foster
care services and the projected level of foster care capacity needed to serve that population.
    Subd. 3. Voluntary closure process need determination. If the report required in subdivision
2 determines the existing supply of foster care capacity is higher than needed to meet the needs
of individuals requiring that level of care, the commissioner shall, within the limits of available
appropriations, announce and implement a program for closure of adult foster care homes.
    Subd. 4. Application process. (a) The commissioner shall establish a process of application,
review, and approval for licensees to submit proposals for the closure of facilities.
    (b) A licensee shall notify the following parties in writing when an application for a planned
closure adjustment is submitted:
   (1) the county social services agency; and
   (2) current and prospective residents and their families.
   (c) After providing written notice, and prior to admission, the licensee must fully inform
prospective residents and their families of the intent to close operations and of the relocation plan.
    Subd. 5. Review and approval process. (a) To be considered for approval, an application must
include:
   (1) a description of the proposed closure plan, which must include identification of the home or
homes to receive a planned closure rate adjustment;
    (2) the proposed timetable for any proposed closure, including the proposed dates for
announcement to residents and the affected county social service agency, commencement of
closure, and completion of closure;
    (3) the proposed relocation plan jointly developed by the county of financial responsibility and
the providers for current residents of any facility designated for closure; and
   (4) documentation in a format approved by the commissioner that all the adult foster care homes

receiving a planned closure rate adjustment under the plan have accepted joint and several liability
for recovery of overpayments under section 256B.0641, subdivision 2, for the facilities designated
for closure under the plan.
   (c) In reviewing and approving closure proposals, the commissioner shall give first priority to
proposals that:
   (1) result in the closing of a facility;
   (2) demonstrate savings of medical assistance expenditures; and
   (3) demonstrate that alternative placements will be developed based on individual resident needs
and applicable federal and state rules.
   The commissioner shall also consider any information provided by residents, their family, or the
county social services agency on the impact of the planned closure on the services they receive.
    (d) The commissioner shall select proposals that best meet the criteria established in this
subdivision within the appropriation made available for planned closure of adult foster care
facilities. The commissioner shall notify licensees of the selections made and approved by the
commissioner.
    (e) For each proposal approved by the commissioner, a contract must be established between
the commissioner, the county of financial responsibility, and the participating licensee.
   Subd. 6. Adjustment to rates. (a) For purposes of this section, the commissioner shall establish
an enhanced payment rate under section 256B.0913 to facilitate an orderly transition for persons
with developmental disabilities from adult foster care to other community-based settings.
   (b) The maximum length the commissioner may establish an enhanced rate is six months.
    (c) The commissioner shall allocate funds, up to a total of $450 in state and federal funds per
adult foster care home bed that is closing, to be used for relocation costs incurred by counties under
this process.
    (d) The commissioner shall analyze the fiscal impact of the closure of each facility on medical
assistance expenditures. Any savings is allocated to the medical assistance program.
   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256D.44, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Special needs. In addition to the state standards of assistance established in subdivisions
1 to 4, payments are allowed for the following special needs of recipients of Minnesota supplemental
aid who are not residents of a nursing home, a regional treatment center, or a group residential
housing facility.
    (a) The county agency shall pay a monthly allowance for medically prescribed diets if the cost
of those additional dietary needs cannot be met through some other maintenance benefit. The need
for special diets or dietary items must be prescribed by a licensed physician. Costs for special diets
shall be determined as percentages of the allotment for a one-person household under the thrifty
food plan as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture. The types of diets and the
percentages of the thrifty food plan that are covered are as follows:
5380                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [96TH DAY

   (1) high protein diet, at least 80 grams daily, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (2) controlled protein diet, 40 to 60 grams and requires special products, 100 percent of thrifty
food plan;
    (3) controlled protein diet, less than 40 grams and requires special products, 125 percent of
thrifty food plan;
   (4) low cholesterol diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (5) high residue diet, 20 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (6) pregnancy and lactation diet, 35 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (7) gluten-free diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (8) lactose-free diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (9) antidumping diet, 15 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (10) hypoglycemic diet, 15 percent of thrifty food plan; or
   (11) ketogenic diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan.
    (b) Payment for nonrecurring special needs must be allowed for necessary home repairs or
necessary repairs or replacement of household furniture and appliances using the payment standard
of the AFDC program in effect on July 16, 1996, for these expenses, as long as other funding sources
are not available.
    (c) A fee for guardian or conservator service is allowed at a reasonable rate negotiated by the
county or approved by the court. This rate shall not exceed five percent of the assistance unit's gross
monthly income up to a maximum of $100 per month. If the guardian or conservator is a member
of the county agency staff, no fee is allowed.
    (d) The county agency shall continue to pay a monthly allowance of $68 for restaurant meals for
a person who was receiving a restaurant meal allowance on June 1, 1990, and who eats two or more
meals in a restaurant daily. The allowance must continue until the person has not received Minnesota
supplemental aid for one full calendar month or until the person's living arrangement changes and
the person no longer meets the criteria for the restaurant meal allowance, whichever occurs first.
    (e) A fee of ten percent of the recipient's gross income or $25, whichever is less, is allowed
for representative payee services provided by an agency that meets the requirements under SSI
regulations to charge a fee for representative payee services. This special need is available to all
recipients of Minnesota supplemental aid regardless of their living arrangement.
    (f)(1) Notwithstanding the language in this subdivision, an amount equal to the maximum
allotment authorized by the federal Food Stamp Program for a single individual which is in
effect on the first day of July of each year will be added to the standards of assistance established
in subdivisions 1 to 4 for adults under the age of 65 who qualify as shelter needy and are: (i)
relocating from an institution, or an adult mental health residential treatment program under section
256B.0622; (ii) eligible for the self-directed supports option as defined under section 256B.0657,
subdivision 2; or (iii) home and community-based waiver recipients living in their own home or

rented or leased apartment which is not owned, operated, or controlled by a provider of service not
related by blood or marriage, unless allowed under paragraph (g).
    (2) Notwithstanding subdivision 3, paragraph (c), an individual eligible for the shelter needy
benefit under this paragraph is considered a household of one. An eligible individual who receives
this benefit prior to age 65 may continue to receive the benefit after the age of 65.
    (3) "Shelter needy" means that the assistance unit incurs monthly shelter costs that exceed 40
percent of the assistance unit's gross income before the application of this special needs standard.
"Gross income" for the purposes of this section is the applicant's or recipient's income as defined
in section 256D.35, subdivision 10, or the standard specified in subdivision 3, paragraph (a) or (b),
whichever is greater. A recipient of a federal or state housing subsidy, that limits shelter costs to a
percentage of gross income, shall not be considered shelter needy for purposes of this paragraph.
     (g) Notwithstanding this subdivision, to access housing and services as provided in paragraph
(f), the recipient may choose housing that may be owned, operated, or controlled by the recipient's
service provider. In a multifamily building o       ­­f­fo

it represents will participate in the program. The exclusive representative shall give the employer
notice of intent to participate at least 30 days before the expiration date of the collective bargaining
agreement preceding the collective bargaining agreement that covers the date of entry into
the program. The exclusive representative and the eligible employer shall give notice to the
commissioner of the determination to participate in the program at least 30 days before entry into
the program. Entry into the program is governed by a schedule established by the commissioner.
Employees of an eligible employer that is not participating in the program as of the date of

has received a formal written bid from the program as of the date of enactment shall be allowed to
enter the program based on the bid if the city so chooses.
    (c) Employees not represented by exclusive representatives may become members of the
program upon a determination of an eligible employer to include these employees in the program.
Either all or none of the employer's unrepresented employees must participate. The eligible
employer shall give at least 30 days' notice to the commissioner before entering the program. Entry
into the program is governed by a schedule established by the commissioner. Employees of an
eligible employer that is not participating in the program as of the date of enactment shall not be
allowed to enter the program until January 1, 2015, except that a city that has received a formal
written bid from the program as of the date of enactment shall be allowed to enter the program

an additional two-year term unless the exclusive representative, or the employer for unrepresented
employees, gives the commissioner notice of withdrawal at least 30 days before expiration of the
participation period. A group that withdraws must wait two years before rejoining. An exclusive
representative, or employer for unrepresented employees, may also withdraw if premiums increase

commissioner at least 30 days before the expiration date of a collective bargaining agreement that
includes the date on which the term of participation expires.

regulated under chapter 62D, or health benefit certificate regulated under chapter 64B, issued,

child health supervision services and prenatal care services. The policy, contract, or certificate
must specifically exempt reasonable and customary charges for child health supervision services
and prenatal care services from a deductible, co-payment, or other coinsurance or dollar limitation
requirement. Nothing in this section prohibits a health plan company that has a network of providers
from imposing a deductible, co-payment, or other coinsurance or dollar limitation requirement for
child health supervision services and prenatal care services that are delivered by an out-of-network
provider. This section does not prohibit the use of policy waiting periods or preexisting condition
limitations for these services. Minimum benefits may be limited to one visit payable to one provider
for all of the services provided at each visit cited in this section subject to the schedule set forth
in this section. N   ­o­­h

using reasonable medical management techniques to determine the frequency, method, treatment,
or setting for child health supervision services and prenatal care services.
    "Child health supervision services" means pediatric preventive services, appropriate
immunizations, developmental assessments, and laboratory services appropriate to the age of a
child from birth to age six, and appropriate immunizations from ages six to 18, as defined by
Standards of Child Health Care issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Reimbursement
must be made for at least five child health supervision visits from birth to 12 months, three child
health supervision visits from 12 months to 24 months, once a year from 24 months to 72 months.
   "Prenatal care services" means the comprehensive package of medical and psychosocial
support provided throughout the pregnancy, including risk assessment, serial surveillance,
prenatal education, and use of specialized skills and technology, when needed, as defined by
Standards for Obstetric-Gynecologic Services issued by the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists.
     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 62A.21, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Continuation privilege. Every policy described in subdivision 1 shall contain a
provision which permits continuation of coverage under the policy for the insured's former spouse
and dependent children upon entry of a valid decree of dissolution of marriage. The coverage shall
be continued until the earlier of the following dates:
     (a) the date the insured's former spouse becomes covered under any other group health plan; or
     (b) the date coverage would otherwise terminate under the policy.
     If the coverage is provided under a group policy, any required premium contributions for the
coverage shall be paid by the insured on a monthly basis to the group policyholder for remittance to
the insurer. The policy must require the group policyholder to, upon request, provide the insured with
written verification from the insurer of the cost of this coverage promptly at the time of eligibility
for this coverage and at any time during the continuation period. ­                  In

required premium amount for continuation of the coverage shall be calculated in the same manner
as provided under section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code, its implementing regulations and
Internal Revenue Service rulings on section 4980B.
    Upon request by the insured's former spouse or dependent child, a health carrier must provide
the instructions necessary to enable the child or former spouse to elect continuation of coverage.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 62D.101, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Continuation privilege. Every health maintenance contract as described in
subdivision 1 shall contain a provision which permits continuation of coverage under the contract
for the enrollee's former spouse and children upon entry of a valid decree of dissolution of marriage.
The coverage shall be continued until the earlier of the following dates:
     (a) the date the enrollee's former spouse becomes covered under another group plan or Medicare;
or
     (b) the date coverage would otherwise terminate under the health maintenance contract.
     If coverage is provided under a group policy, any required premium contributions for the
coverage shall be paid by the enrollee on a monthly basis to the group contract holder to be paid to
the health maintenance organization. The contract must require the group contract holder to, upon
request, provide the enrollee with written verification from the insurer of the cost of this coverage
promptly at the time of eligibility for this coverage and at any time during the continuation period.

    Sec. 8. [148.2855] NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT.
    The Nurse Licensure Compact is enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions
legally joining in it, in the form substantially as follows:
                                                   ARTICLE 1
                                                  DEFINITIONS
    As used in this compact:
    (a) "Adverse action" means a home or remote state action.
   (b) "Alternative program" means a voluntary, nondisciplinary monitoring program approved by
a nurse licensing board.
    (c) "Coordinated licensure information system" means an integrated process for collecting,
storing, and sharing information on nurse licensure and enforcement activities related to nurse
licensure laws, which is administered by a nonprofit organization composed of and controlled by
state nurse licensing boards.
    (d) "Current significant investigative information" means:
96TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 29, 2012                                        5397

    (1) investigative information that a licensing board, after a preliminary inquiry that includes
notification and an opportunity for the nurse to respond if required by state law, has reason to believe
is not groundless and, if proved true, would indicate more than a minor infraction; or
   (2) investigative information that indicates that the nurse represents an immediate threat to public
health and safety regardless of whether the nurse has been notified and had an opportunity to respond.
   (e) "Home state" means the party state which is the nurse's primary state of residence.
    (f) "Home state action" means any administrative, civil, equitable, or criminal action permitted
by the home state's laws which are imposed on a nurse by the home state's licensing board or other
authority including actions against an individual's license such as revocation, suspension, probation,
or any other action which affects a nurse's authorization to practice.
    (g) "Licensing board" means a party state's regulatory body responsible for issuing nurse
licenses.
   (h) "Multistate licensure privilege" means current, official authority from a remote state
permitting the practice of nursing as either a registered nurse or a licensed practical/vocational
nurse in the party state. All party states have the authority, according to existing state due process
law, to take actions against the nurse's privilege such as revocation, suspension, probation, or any
other action which affects a nurse's authorization to practice.
    (i) "Nurse" means a registered nurse or licensed practical/vocational nurse as those terms are
defined by each party state's practice laws.
   (j) "Party state" means any state that has adopted this compact.
   (k) "Remote state" means a party state other than the home state:
   (1) where the patient is located at the time nursing care is provided; or
    (2) in the case of the practice of nursing not involving a patient, in the party state where the
recipient of nursing practice is located.
   (l) "Remote state action" means:
    (1) any administrative, civil, equitable, or criminal action permitted by a remote state's laws
which are imposed on a nurse by the remote state's licensing board or other authority including
actions against an individual's multistate licensure privilege to practice in the remote state; and
    (2) cease and desist and other injunctive or equitable orders issued by remote states or the
licensing boards of those states.
    (m) "State" means a state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia,

                           GENERAL PROVISIONS AND JURISDICTION
    (a) A license to practice registered nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will
be recognized by each party state as authorizing a multistate licensure privilege to practice as a
registered nurse in the party state. A license to practice licensed practical/vocational nursing issued
by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a
multistate licensure privilege to practice as a licensed practical/vocational nurse in the party state.
In order to obtain or retain a license, an applicant must meet the home state's qualifications for
licensure and license renewal as well as all other applicable state laws.
    (b) Party states may, according to state due process laws, limit or revoke the multistate licensure
privilege of any nurse to practice in their state and may take any other actions under their applicable
state laws necessary to protect the health and safety of their citizens. If a party state takes such
action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system.
The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home
state of any such actions by remote states.
    (c) Every nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state
in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered. In addition, the practice of nursing is not
limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of
the party state. The practice of nursing will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the nurse licensing
board, the courts, and the laws in the party state.
    (d) This compact does not affect additional requirements imposed by states for advanced practice
registered nursing. However, a multistate licensure privilege to practice registered nursing granted
by a party state shall be recognized by other party states as a license to practice registered nursing if
one is required by state law as a precondition for qualifying for advanced practice registered nurse
authorization.
    (e) Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for nurse licensure
as provided for under the laws of each party state. However, the license granted to these individuals
will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice nursing in any other party state unless
explicitly agreed to by that party state.

                      APPLICATIONS FOR LICENSURE IN A PARTY STATE
    (a) Upon application for a license, the licensing board in a party state shall ascertain, through
the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held or is the holder
of a license issued by any other state, whether there are any restrictions on the multistate licensure
privilege, and whether any other adverse action by a state has been taken against the license.
   (b) A nurse in a party state shall hold licensure in only one party state at a time, issued by the
home state.
    (c) A nurse who intends to change primary state of residence may apply for licensure in the new
home state in advance of the change. However, new licenses will not be issued by a party state until
after a nurse provides evidence of change in primary state of residence satisfactory to the new home

state's licensing board.
   (d) When a nurse changes primary state of residence by:
   (1) moving between two party states, and obtains a license from the new home state, the license
from the former home state is no longer valid;
    (2) moving from a nonparty state to a party state, and obtains a license from the new home state,
the individual state license issued by the nonparty state is not affected and will remain in full force
if so provided by the laws of the nonparty state; or
    (3) moving from a party state to a nonparty state, the license issued by the prior home state
converts to an individual state license, valid only in the former home state, without the multistate
licensure privilege to practice in other party states.

   In addition to the general provisions described in article 2, the provisions in this article apply.
    (a) The licensing board of a remote state shall promptly report to the administrator of the
coordinated licensure information system any remote state actions including the factual and legal
basis for the action, if known. The licensing board of a remote state shall also promptly report any
significant current investigative information yet to result in a remote state action. The administrator
of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any reports.
    (b) The licensing board of a party state shall have the authority to complete any pending
investigation for a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of the
investigation. The board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action, and shall promptly
report the conclusion of the investigation to the administrator of the coordinated licensure
information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall
promptly notify the new home state of any action.
   (c) A remote state may take adverse action affecting the multistate licensure privilege to practice
within that party state. However, only the home state shall have the power to impose adverse action
against the license issued by the home state.
    (d) For purposes of imposing adverse actions, the licensing board of the home state shall give
the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if the
conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, it shall apply its own state laws to determine
appropriate action.
   (e) The home state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state,
provided each state follows its own procedures for imposing the adverse action.
    (f) Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an
alternative program may be used in lieu of licensure action and that participation shall remain
nonpublic if required by the party state's laws.
   Party states must require nurses who enter any alternative programs to agree not to practice in
any other party state during the term of the alternative program without prior authorization from the

board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and the production of evidence
from another party state, shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction
according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings
pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and
other fees required by the service statutes of the state where the witnesses and evidence are located;

report adverse actions, actions against multistate licensure privileges, any current significant
investigative information yet to result in adverse action, denials of applications, and the reasons
for the denials to the coordinated licensure information system.
    (c) Current significant investigative information shall be transmitted through the coordinated
licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.
