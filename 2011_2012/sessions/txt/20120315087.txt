reasonable costs incurred including, but not limited to, related supplies, transportation, advertising,
and disposal costs as well as reasonable overhead costs.
    (d) A person who collects waste pesticide under this section shall, on a form provided or in

the state's authorized transporter.
    (b) The state is not obligated to defend or indemnify a local unit of government under this

list of those licensed agricultural pesticide dealers or pesticide dealers that have been granted an
exemption on the department's Web site.

    (j) The heading for and percentage by weight of pure seed may be omitted from a label if the
total is more than 90 percent.
    (k) The heading for and percentage by weight of weed seed may be omitted from a label if they
are not present in the seed.
   (l) The heading "noxious weed seeds" may be omitted from a label if they are not present in the
seed.
     (m) The heading for and percentage by weight of other crop seed may be omitted from a label
if it is less than five percent.
    (n) The heading for and percentage by weight of inert matter may be omitted from a label if it
is less than ten percent.
    (o) The label must contain the name and address of the person who labeled the seed or who sells
the seed in this state or a code number that has been registered with the commissioner.
    (p) The labeling requirements for vegetable seeds prepared for use in home gardens or household
plantings when sold outside their original containers are met if the seed is weighed from a properly
labeled container in the presence of the purchaser.
    Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 21.82, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
    Subd. 8. Flower seeds. For flower and wildflower seeds prepared for use in home gardens or
household plantings, the requirements in paragraphs (a) to (l) apply. Flower and wildflower seeds
packed for sale in commercial quantities to farmers, conservation groups, and other similar entities
are considered agricultural seeds and must be labeled accordingly.
    (a) The label must contain the name of the kind and variety or a statement of type and
performance characteristics as prescribed by rule.
   (b) The percentage that is hybrid must be at least 95 percent of the percentage of pure seed
shown unless the percentage of pure seed which is hybrid seed is shown separately. If two or more
kinds of varieties are present in excess of five percent and are named on the label, each that is hybrid
must be designated as hybrid on the label. Any one kind or kind and variety that has pure seed that

is less than 95 percent but more than 75 percent hybrid seed as a result of incompletely controlled
pollination in a cross must be labeled to show the percentage of pure seed that is hybrid seed or a
statement such as "contains from 75 percent to 95 percent hybrid seed." No one kind or variety of
seed may be labeled as hybrid if the pure seed contains less than 75 percent hybrid seed. The word
"hybrid" must be shown on the label in conjunction with the kind.
    (c) Blends must be listed on the label using the term "blend" in conjunction with the kind.
    (d) Mixtures must be listed on the label using the term "mixture," "mix," or "mixed."
    (e) The label must contain the lot number or other lot identification.
    (f) The origin may be omitted from the label.
    (g) The label must contain the year for which the seed was packed for sale listed as "packed for
(year)" for seed with a percentage of germination that exceeds the standard last established by the
commissioner, the percentage of germination and the calendar month and year that the percentages
were determined by test, or the calendar month and year the germination test was completed and
the statement "sell by (month and year listed here)," which may be no more than 12 months from
the date of test, exclusive of the month of test.
    (h) For flower seeds which germinate less than the standard last established by the commissioner,
the label must show:
    (1) percentage of germination exclusive of hard or dormant seed or both;
    (2) percentage of hard or dormant seed or both, if present; and
   (3) the words "below standard" in not less than eight point type and the month and year this
percentage was determined by test.

infected premises designated by the board as quarantined under subdivision 2. The executive director
of the board or any licensed veterinarian designated by the board may issue the orders. An order may
be issued upon a determination that reasonable cause exists to believe that the movement of persons
or personal property out of a quarantine zone will reasonably threaten to transport a dangerous,
infectious, or communicable disease outside of the quarantine zone.
    (b) The order must be served upon any person subject to the order. The restrictions sought by
the board on movement out of a quarantine zone must be limited to the greatest extent possible
consistent with the paramount disease control objectives as determined by the board. An order under
this section may be served on any day at any time. The order must include a notice of the person's
rights under this section, including the ability to enter into an agreement to abide by disease control
measures under paragraph (c) and the right to request a court hearing under paragraph (d).
    (c) No person may be restricted by an order under this subdivision for longer than 72 hours,

exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, so long as the person agrees to abide by the
disease control measures established by the board. The person shall sign an acknowledgment form
prepared by the board evidencing the person's agreement to abide by the disease control measures
established by the board.
    (d) A person whose movements are restricted by an order under this subdivision may seek a
district court hearing on the order at any time after it is served on the person. The hearing may be
held by electronic means as soon as possible. The subject of the order may:
    (1) contest imposition of the order on grounds that it is an abuse of the board's discretion under
this section; or
   (2) seek a variance from it to allow movement of a person inconsistent with the order, upon a
showing that the person would otherwise suffer irreparable harm.

statement from a licensee which has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and which meets the following requirements:
   ­
   (­) (1) The financial statement shall include, but not be limited to the following: ­
                                                                                       (1

                          ­­)
    (ii) a statement of income (profit and loss); ­
                                                  (3
                                                   ­­)
    (iii) a statement of retained earnings; ­
                                            (4
                                             ­­)
    (iv) a statement of changes in financial position; and ­
                                                           (5
                                                            ­­)
   (v) a statement of the dollar amount of grain purchased in the previous fiscal year of the grain
buyer.
    ­
    (b
     ­­) (2) The financial statement shall be accompanied by a compilation report of the financial
statement that is prepared by a grain commission firm or a management firm approved by the
commissioner or by an independent public accountant, in accordance with standards established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Grain buyers purchasing less than 150,000
bushels of grain per calendar year may submit a financial statement prepared by a public accountant
who is not an employee or a relative within the third degree of kindred according to civil law.
    ­
    (­) (3) The financial statement shall be accompanied by a certification by the chief executive
     c­
officer or the chief executive officer's designee of the licensee, under penalty of perjury, that the
financial statement accurately reflects the financial condition of the licensee for the period specified
in the statement.
    (b) Only one financial statement must be filed for a chain of warehouses owned or operated as a
single business entity, unless otherwise required by the commissioner. Any grain buyer having a net
worth in excess of $500,000,000 need not file the financial statement required by this subdivision
but must provide the commissioner with a certified net worth statement. All financial statements

duplicate copy of each scale ticket shall remain in the possession of the public or private grain
warehouse operator as a permanent record. The original scale ticket shall be delivered to the
depositor upon receipt of each load of grain. Each scale ticket shall have printed across its face
"This is a memorandum, nonnegotiable, possession of which does not signify that settlement has or
has not been consummated." The scale ticket shall state specifically whether the grain is received
on contract, for storage, for shipment or consignment or sold. If the grain is received on contract
or sold, the price shall be indicated on the scale ticket. All paper scale tickets shall be dated and
signed by the public or private grain warehouse operator or the operator's agent or manager.

     Subd. 10. Delivery of grain. (a) On the redemption of a grain warehouse receipt and payment of
all lawful charges, the grain represented by the receipt is immediately deliverable to the depositor or
the depositor's order, and is not subject to any further charge for storage after demand for delivery
has been made and proper facilities for receiving and shipping the grain have been provided. If
delivery has not commenced within 48 hours after demand has been made and proper facilities have
been provided, the public grain warehouse operator issuing the grain warehouse receipt is liable to
the owner in damages not exceeding two cents per bushel for each day's delay, unless the public
grain warehouse operator makes delivery to different owners in the order demanded as rapidly as it
can be done through ordinary diligence, or unless insolvency has occurred.
     (b) If a disagreement arises between the person receiving and the person delivering the grain at a
public grain warehouse in this state as to the proper grade or dockage of any grain, an average sample
of at least three quarts of the grain in dispute may be taken by either or both of the persons interested.
The sample shall be certified by both the owner and the public grain warehouse operator as being
true samples of the grain in dispute on the delivery day. The samples shall be forwarded in a suitable
airtight container by parcel post or express, prepaid, with the name and address of both parties, to ­ht­­

    This section applies to a carcass, part of a carcass, meat, or meat food product of an animal,
a product exempted from the definition of a meat food product, or a dead, dying, disabled, or
diseased animal. If an authorized representative of the commissioner finds such an article or animal
on premises where it is held for purposes of, during, or after distribution in intrastate commerce,
and there is reason to believe that it is adulterated or misbranded and is usable as human food,
or that it has not been inspected, in violation of sections 31A.01 to 31A.16, the Federal Meat
Inspection Act, or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or that the article or animal has
been or is intended to be distributed in violation of a provision of those laws, it may be detained
by the representative for up to 20 days pending action under section 3     ­­
                                                                            1A­­2

2, or notification of federal authorities having jurisdiction over the article or animal. It must not be
moved by a person, firm, or corporation from the place at which it is located when detained, until
released by the representative. The representative may require all official marks to be removed
from the article or animal before it is released unless the commissioner is satisfied that the article
or animal is eligible to retain the official marks.

represented to possess by its labeling; or
   (15) it is confectionery and:
    (i) has partially or completely imbedded therein any nonnutritive object; provided, that this
clause does not apply in the case of any nonnutritive object if in the judgment of the commissioner,
as provided by rules, the object is of practical functional value to the confectionery product and
would not render the product injurious or hazardous to human or animal health; or
    (ii) bears or contains any nonnutritive substance; provided that this item does not apply to a
confection containing alcohol as defined in section 31.76, or a safe nonnutritive substance which is
in or on confectionery by reason of its use for some practical functional purpose in the manufacture,
packaging, or storing of the confectionery if the use of the substance does not promote deception

to the application of this clause, issue rules allowing or prohibiting the use of particular nonnutritive
substances.
   Subd. 2. Commercial feed or material. For only commercial feed an item is adulterated if:

rules promulgated by the commissioner to ensure that the drug meets the safety requirements
of sections 25.31 to 25.43 and has the identity and strength and meets the quality and purity
characteristics that it purports or is represented to possess. In adopting rules under this clause,
the commissioner shall adopt the current good manufacturing practice rules for medicated feed
premixes and for medicated feeds established under authority of the federal act, unless the

    (5) it purports to be or is represented as a food for which a definition and standard of identity
have been prescribed by rules as provided by sections 31.10, 31.102, and 31A.07, unless it conforms
to that definition and standard, and its label bears the name of the food specified in the definition and
standard, and insofar as may be required by the rules, the common names of optional ingredients,
other than spices, flavoring, and coloring, present in the food;
   (6) it purports to be or is represented as:
   (i) a food for which a standard of quality has been prescribed by rules as provided by sections
31.10 and 31.102, and its quality falls below that standard unless its label bears in a manner and
form the rules specify, a statement that it falls below the standard; or
    (ii) a food for which a standard or standards of fill of container have been prescribed by rule as
provided by sections 31.10, 31.102, and 31A.07, and it falls below the standard of fill of container
applicable thereto unless its label bears, in a manner and form the rules specify, a statement that it
falls below the standard;
    (7) it is not subject to clause (5), unless it bears labeling clearly giving the common or usual name
of the food, if there is one, and in case it is fabricated from two or more ingredients, the common or
usual name of each ingredient, except that spices, flavorings, and colorings, other than those sold as
such, may be designated as spices, flavorings, and colorings, without naming each; provided, that to
the extent that compliance with the requirements of this clause is impractical or results in deception
or unfair competition, exemptions must be established by rules promulgated by the commissioner;
   (8) it purports to be or is represented for special dietary uses, unless its label bears information

coloring do not apply to butter, cheese, or ice cream. The provisions with respect to chemical
preservatives do not apply to a pesticide when used in or on a raw agricultural commodity which
is the product of the soil;
    (10) it is a product intended as an ingredient of another food and when used according to the
directions of the purveyor will result in the final food product being adulterated or misbranded;
4462                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [87TH DAY

   (11) it is a color additive unless its packaging and labeling are in conformity with such packaging
and labeling requirements applicable to the color additive prescribed under the provisions of the
federal act;
    (12) it is food subject to section 31.101, subdivision 10, or chapter 31A, that fails to bear,
directly or on its container, as the commissioner by rule prescribes, the inspection legend and other
information the commissioner may require by rule to ensure that it will not have false or misleading
labeling, and that the public will be told how to keep the article wholesome; or
    (13) its labeling would deceive or mislead the purchaser with respect to its composition or
suitability.
    (b) Food is also misbranded if it is a raw agricultural commodity which is the product of the
soil, bearing or containing a pesticide applied after harvest, unless the shipping container of that
commodity bears labeling which declares the presence of the chemical in or on the commodity and
the common or usual name and the function of the chemical. No such declaration is required while
the commodity, having been removed from the shipping container, is being held or displayed for
sale at retail out of the container in accordance with the custom of the trade.
   Sec. 31. [34A.04] ENFORCEMENT.
    Subdivision 1. Enforcement required. (a) The commissioner shall enforce this chapter and

   (d) Upon the request of the commissioner, county attorneys, sheriffs, and other officers having
authority in the enforcement of the general criminal laws shall take action to the extent of their
authority necessary or proper for the enforcement of this chapter or standards, stipulations, and
agreements of the commissioner.

commissioner believes the public interest will be best served by a suitable notice of warning in
writing, this chapter does not require the commissioner to take any additional action.
    Subd. 3. Civil actions. Civil judicial enforcement actions may be brought by the attorney general
in the name of the state on behalf of the commissioner. A county attorney may bring a civil judicial

or administrative penalty if the commissioner determines that the remedy is in the public interest.
    (b) For facilities required to submit a plan review under rules of the commissioner of agriculture,
the commissioner may withdraw by written order the approval of a facility or equipment if:

    (2) there is satisfactory evidence that the person to whom the approval was issued has used
fraudulent or deceptive practices to evade or attempt to evade provisions of this chapter.

certification if a person violates or has violated this chapter within the last three years.
    (b) The commissioner may revoke, suspend, limit, modify, or refuse to grant or renew a
registration, listing, permit, license, or certification to a person from another state if that person has
had a registration, permit, license, or certification denied, revoked, or suspended by another state
for an offense reasonably related to the requirements, qualifications, or duties of a registration,
permit, license, or certification issued under this chapter.
    (c) The commissioner may revoke, suspend, limit, modify, or refuse to grant or renew a
registration, listing, permit, license, or certification to a person after receiving satisfactory evidence
that the registrant, permittee, licensee, or certificate holder has used fraudulent and deceptive
practices in the evasion or attempted evasion of this chapter.
    (d) A registration, listing, permit, license, or certification may not be revoked or suspended until
the registrant, permittee, licensee, or certificate holder has been given opportunity for a hearing
by the commissioner. After receiving notice of revocation or suspension, a registrant, permittee,
licensee, registrant, or certificate holder has ten days to request a hearing, or another time period
4464                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                     [87TH DAY

mutually agreed to by both parties. If no request is made within ten days or other agreed-upon
time, the registration, listing, permit, license, or certification is revoked or suspended. In the case
of a refusal to grant a registration, listing, permit, license, or certification, the registrant, permittee,
licensee, registrant, or certificate holder has ten days from notice of refusal to request a hearing.
Upon receiving a request for hearing, the department shall proceed pursuant to section 34A.08,
subdivision 2.
   Sec. 34. [34A.07] ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
    Subdivision 1. Assessment. (a) In determining the amount of the administrative penalty, the
commissioner shall consider the economic gain received by the person allowing or committing the
violation, the gravity of the violation in terms of actual or potential damage to human or animal
health and the environment, the willfulness of the violation, number of violations, history of past
violations, and other factors justice may require, if the additional factors are specifically identified in
the inspection report. For a violation after an initial violation, the commissioner shall also consider
the similarity of the most recent previous violation and the violation to be penalized, the time elapsed
since the last violation, the number of previous violations, and the response of the person to the most
recent previous violation identified.
    (b) The commissioner may issue an administrative citation assessing an administrative penalty of
up to $1,500 for each violation of this chapter. Each day a violation continues is a separate violation.
The citation must describe the nature of the violation, the statute or rule alleged to have been violated,
the time for correction, if applicable, and the amount of any proposed fine. The citation must advise
the person to notify the commissioner in writing within 20 days, or another time period mutually
agreed to by the commissioner and the person subject to the citation, if the person wishes to appeal
the citation and that if the person fails to appeal the citation, the citation is the final order and not
subject to further review.
   (c) An administrative penalty may be assessed if the person subject to a written order does not
comply with the order in the time provided in the order.
    Subd. 2. Collection of penalty. (a) If a person subject to an administrative penalty fails to pay
the penalty, which must be part of a final citation by the commissioner, by 30 days after the final
order is issued, the commissioner may commence a civil action for double the assessed penalty plus
attorney fees and costs.
    (b) An administrative penalty may be recovered in a civil action in the name of the state brought
in the district court of the county where the violation is alleged to have occurred or the district court
where the commissioner has an office.
   Sec. 35. [34A.08] APPEAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION OR PENALTY.
    Subdivision 1. Notice of appeal. (a) After service of a citation under section 34A.07 or order
under section 34A.06, subdivision 1, a person has 20 days from receipt of the citation or order, or
another time period mutually agreed to by the commissioner and the person subject to the citation
or order, to notify the commissioner in writing that the person intends to contest the citation or
order through a hearing. The hearing request must specifically identify the order or citation being
contested and state the grounds for contesting it.
   (b) If the person fails to notify the commissioner that the person intends to contest the citation
87TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 15, 2012                                         4465

or order, the citation or order is final and not subject to further judicial or administrative review.
    Subd. 2. Administrative review. If a person notifies the commissioner that the person intends
to contest a citation or order issued under this chapter, the Office of Administrative Hearings
shall conduct a hearing in accordance with the applicable provisions of chapter 14 for hearings in
contested cases.
   Sec. 36. [34A.09] CIVIL PENALTIES.
    Subdivision 1. General penalty. A person who violates this chapter or an order, standard,
stipulation, agreement, citation, or schedule of compliance of the commissioner or impedes,
hinders, or otherwise prevents or attempts to prevent performance of a duty by the commissioner
in connection with this chapter is subject to a civil penalty of up to $7,500 per day of violation as
determined by the court.
    Subd. 2. Actions to compel performance. In an action to compel performance of an order of
the commissioner to enforce this chapter, the court must require a defendant adjudged responsible to
perform the acts within the person's power that are reasonably necessary to accomplish the purposes
of the order.
    Subd. 3. Recovery of penalties by civil action. The civil penalties and payments provided for
in this section may be recovered by a civil action brought by the county attorney or the attorney
general in the name of the state.
   Sec. 37. [34A.10] CRIMINAL PENALTIES.
    Subdivision 1. General violation. Except as provided in subdivisions 2 and 3, a person is guilty
of a misdemeanor if the person violates this chapter or an order, standard, citation, stipulation,
agreement, or schedule of compliance of the commissioner, or impedes, hinders, or otherwise
prevents, or attempts to prevent the commissioner or a duly authorized agent in performance of
a duty in connection with this chapter. Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, each separate
violation is a separate offense, except that in the case of a violation through continuing failure or
neglect to obey this chapter, each day the failure or neglect continues is a separate offense.
    Subd. 2. Violation endangering humans or animals. A person is guilty of a gross misdemeanor
if the person violates this chapter or an order, standard, stipulation, agreement, or schedule of
compliance of the commissioner and the violation endangers humans or animals.

knowingly violates this chapter or an order, standard, stipulation, agreement, or schedule of
compliance of the commissioner.
   Sec. 38. [34A.11] EMBARGO, SEIZURE, AND CONDEMNATION.
    Subdivision 1. Tag, notice, or withdrawal from distribution. If the commissioner finds
probable cause to believe that any food, animal, or consumer commodity is being distributed in
violation of this chapter or rules under this chapter, or is adulterated or so misbranded as to be
dangerous or fraudulent, the commissioner shall affix to the food, animal, or consumer commodity
a tag, withdrawal from distribution order, or other appropriate marking giving notice that the food,
animal, or consumer commodity is, or is suspected of being, adulterated, misbranded, or distributed
in violation of this chapter, and has been detained or embargoed, and warning all persons not
4466                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [87TH DAY

to remove or dispose of the food, animal, or consumer commodity by sale or otherwise until
permission for removal or disposal is given by the commissioner or the court. It is unlawful for a
person to remove or dispose of a detained or embargoed food, animal, or consumer commodity
by sale or otherwise without the commissioner's or a court's permission and each transaction is a
separate violation of this subdivision.
    Subd. 2. Seizure. A carcass; part of a carcass; meat or meat food product of an animal; or dead,
dying, disabled, or diseased animal that is being transported in intrastate commerce, or is held for
sale in this state after transportation in intrastate commerce, may be proceeded against, seized, and
condemned if:
    (1) it is or has been prepared, sold, transported, or otherwise distributed, offered, or received for
distribution in violation of this chapter;
   (2) it is usable as human food and is adulterated or misbranded; or
   (3) it is in any other way in violation of this chapter.
   The commissioner may act against the article or animal at any time on a complaint in the district
court of the judicial district where the article or animal is found.
    Subd. 3. Action for condemnation. If food or an article or animal, detained or embargoed under
subdivision 1 has been found by the commissioner to be adulterated or misbranded or in violation
of this chapter, the commissioner shall petition the district court in the county in which the food or
animal is detained or embargoed for an order and decree for the condemnation of the food or animal.
The commissioner shall release the food or animal when this chapter and rules adopted under this
chapter have been complied with or the food or animal is found to be not adulterated or misbranded.
    Subd. 4. Remedies. If the court finds that a detained or embargoed food or animal is adulterated,
misbranded, or in violation of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter, the following remedies
are available:
   (1) after entering a decree, the food or animal may be destroyed at the expense of the claimant
under the supervision of the commissioner, and all court costs, fees, storage, and other proper
expenses, must be assessed against the claimant of the food or animal or the claimant's agent; and
    (2) if adulteration or misbranding can be corrected by proper labeling or processing of the food
or animal, the court, after entry of the decree and after costs, fees, and expenses have been paid and a
good and sufficient bond, conditioned that the food or animal must be properly labeled or processed,
has been executed, may by order direct that the food or animal be delivered to the claimant for proper
labeling or processing under the supervision of the commissioner. The expense of the supervision
must be paid by the claimant. The food or animal must be returned to the claimant and the bond
must be discharged on the representation to the court by the commissioner that the food or animal
is no longer in violation and that the expenses for the supervision have been paid.
    Subd. 5. Duties of commissioner. If the commissioner finds in any room, building, vehicle of
transportation, or other structure any meat, seafood, poultry, vegetable, fruit, or other perishable
articles of food that are unsound, or contain any filthy, decomposed, or putrid substance, or that
may be poisonous or deleterious to health or otherwise unsafe, the commissioner shall condemn or
destroy the item or in any other manner render the item as unsalable as human food, and no one has
any cause of action against the commissioner on account of the commissioner's action.
87TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 15, 2012                                       4467

    Subd. 6. Emergency response. If the governor declares an emergency order under section
12.31 and if the commissioner finds or has probable cause to believe that livestock, food, or a
consumer commodity within a specific area is likely to be adulterated because of the emergency or
so misbranded as to be dangerous or fraudulent, or is in violation of section 31.131, subdivision
1, the commissioner may embargo a geographic area that is included in the declared emergency.
The commissioner shall provide notice to the public and to those with custody of the product in as
thorough a manner as is practicable under the emergency circumstances.
   Sec. 39. [34A.12] POWERS OF THE COMMISSIONER.
   Subdivision 1. Gathering information. The commissioner may, for the purposes of this chapter:
    (1) gather and compile information concerning and investigate the organization, business,
conduct, practices, and management of a person in intrastate commerce and the person's relation
to other persons; and
    (2) require, by general or special orders, a person, persons, or a class of persons engaged
in intrastate commerce to file with the commissioner, in the form the commissioner prescribes,
annual and special reports or answers in writing to specific questions, giving the commissioner
the information the commissioner requires about the organization, business, conduct, practices,
management, and relation to other persons, of the person filing the reports or answers. The reports
and answers must be made under oath, or otherwise, as the commissioner prescribes, and filed with
the commissioner within a reasonable time the commissioner prescribes, unless additional time is
granted by the commissioner.
    Subd. 2. Examination of documents for evidence. (a) For purposes of this chapter, the
commissioner must at all reasonable times be allowed to examine and copy documentary evidence
of a person being investigated or proceeded against. The commissioner may subpoena witnesses
and require the production of documentary evidence of a person relating to any matter under
investigation. The commissioner may sign subpoenas, administer oaths and affirmations, examine
witnesses, and receive evidence.
    (b) Attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence may be required at a
designated hearing place. In case of disobedience to a subpoena, the commissioner may invoke the
aid of the district court to require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of
documentary evidence.
    (c) The district court, in case of refusal to obey a subpoena issued to a person, may issue an
order requiring the person to appear before the commissioner or to produce documentary evidence
if ordered, or to give evidence touching the matter in question. Failure to obey the order of the court
may be punishable by the court as a contempt.
    (d) Upon the application of the attorney general at the request of the commissioner, the district
court may order a person to comply with this chapter or an order of the commissioner made under
this chapter.
   (e) The commissioner may order testimony to be taken by deposition in a proceeding or
investigation pending under this chapter at any state of the proceeding or investigation. Depositions
may be taken before a person designated by the commissioner and having power to administer
oaths. The testimony must be reduced to writing by the person taking the deposition or under
4468                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [87TH DAY

the person's direction and must then be signed by the witness. A person may be compelled to
appear and depose and to produce documentary evidence in the same manner as witnesses may be
compelled to appear and testify and produce documentary evidence before the commissioner.
    (f) Witnesses summoned before the commissioner may be paid the same fees and mileage that
are paid witnesses in the district courts. Witnesses whose depositions are taken and the persons
taking them may be entitled to the fees that are paid for those services in the district court.
    (g) A person is not excused from attending and testifying or from producing books,
papers, schedules of charges, contracts, agreements, or other documentary evidence before the
commissioner or in obedience to the subpoena of the commissioner whether the subpoena is
signed or issued by the commissioner or the commissioner's agent, or in any cause or proceeding,
criminal or otherwise, based upon or growing out of an alleged violation of this chapter because the
testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of the person may tend to incriminate
the person or subject the person to a penalty or forfeiture. No person may be prosecuted or subjected
to a penalty or forfeiture on account of a matter concerning which the person is compelled, after
having claimed a privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence, documentary
or otherwise, except that a witness is not exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury
committed in testifying.
    Subd. 3. Penalties related to testimony and records. (a) A person who neglects or refuses to
attend and testify, to answer a lawful inquiry, or to produce documentary evidence, if it is in the
person's power to do so in obedience to the subpoena or lawful requirement of the commissioner, is
guilty of a misdemeanor.
   (b) A person who willfully:
   (1) makes or causes to be made a false entry or statement of fact in a report required under this
chapter;
   (2) makes or causes to be made a false entry in an account, record, or memorandum kept by a
person subject to this chapter;
   (3) neglects or fails to make or to cause to be made full and correct entries in the accounts,
records, or memoranda, of all facts and transactions relating to the person's business;
   (4) leaves the jurisdiction of this state;
    (5) mutilates, alters, or by any other means falsifies documentary evidence of a person subject
to this chapter; or
   `(6) refuses to submit to the commissioner, for inspection and copying, any documentary
evidence of a person subject to this chapter in the person's possession or control, is guilty of a
misdemeanor.
    (c) A person required by this chapter to file an annual or special report who fails to do so within
the time fixed by the commissioner for filing the report and continues the failure for 30 days after
notice of failure to file, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
   (d) An officer or employee of this state who makes public information obtained by the
commissioner without the commissioner's authority, unless directed by a court, is guilty of a
87TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 15, 2012                                          4469

operate an alarm system; and otherwise prevent or minimize damage to the premises from the
elements, vandalism, trespass, or other illegal activities. If the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's
certificate installs or changes locks under this section, a key to the premises must be promptly
delivered to the mortgagor or any person lawfully claiming through the mortgagor, upon request.
    (b) If the gas or electric service to the premises has been disconnected, the holder of the sheriff's
certificate of sale may have service restored or continued by paying the unpaid charges incurred
after the sheriff's sale, if the person who incurred those charges still occupies the premises, or by
becoming the bill payer responsible and customer of record for the service if the person who incurred
those charges does not occupy the premises. A holder who becomes the customer of record of a
cooperative electric association does not acquire membership rights. Exercise of the right to pay
charges does not preclude the holder from exercising the right to become the bill payer responsible
and customer of record.

for the election of an office made an appointed position under this section, but not until at least three
years after the office was made an appointed position. The county board must publish a proposed

comment relating to the issue. After the public comment hearing, the county board may adopt the
resolution. The resolution must be approved by at least 60 percent of the members of the county
board and is effective August 1 following adoption of the resolution.

made an elected office must be placed on the ballot at the next general election if (1) the position
has been an appointed position for at least three years, (2) a petition signed by at least ten percent of
the registered voters of the county is filed with the office of the county auditor-treasurer by August
1 of the year in which the general election is held, and (3) the petition meets the requirements of
the secretary of state, as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 204B.071, and any rules adopted
to implement that section. If a majority of the voters of the county voting on the question vote in
favor of making the office an elected position, the election for that office must be held at the next
