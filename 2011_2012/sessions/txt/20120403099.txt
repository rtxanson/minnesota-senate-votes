allow sites to implement an agreement that at least:
    (1) notwithstanding subdivision 3, allocates to the site all revenue that is attributable to the
students at that site;
    (2) includes a provision, consistent with current law and the collective bargaining agreement in
effect, that allows the site team to decide who is selected from within the district for licensed and
nonlicensed positions at the site and to make staff assignments in the site; and
    (3) includes a completed performance agreement under subdivision 4.
    The commissioner shall establish the form and manner of the application for a grant and annually,
at the end of each fiscal year, report to the house of representatives and senate committees having
jurisdiction over education on the progress of the program.
    Subd. 3. Revenue and cost allocation. Revenue for a fiscal year received or receivable by the
district shall be allocated to education sites based on the agreement between the school board and the
site decision-making team. Revenue shall remain allocated to each site until used by the site. The site
teams and the board may enter an agreement that permits the district to provide services and retain
the revenue required to pay for the services provided. The district remains responsible for legally
entering into contracts and expending funds. For the purposes of this subdivision, "allocation" means
that the determination of the use of the revenue shall be under the control of the site. The district may
charge the accounts of each site the actual costs of goods and services from the general or capital
funds attributable to the site.

parent or guardian is not living within the state; or (3) the parent or guardian having legal custody
of the child is an inmate of a Minnesota correctional facility or is a resident of a halfway house
under the supervision of the commissioner of corrections. If any of clauses (1) to (3) apply, the
school district of residence shall be the school district in which the pupil resided when the qualifying
event occurred. If no other district of residence can be established, the school district of residence
shall be the school district in which the pupil currently resides. If there is a dispute between school
districts regarding residency, the district of residence is the district designated by the commissioner
of education.
    (c) The serving district is responsible for transporting a homeless pupil to and from the pupil's
district of residence. The district may transport from a permanent home in another district but only
through the end of the academic school year. When a pupil is enrolled in a charter school, the district
or school that provides transportation for other pupils enrolled in the charter school is responsible
for providing transportation. When a homeless student with or without an individualized education
program attends a public school other than an independent or special school district or charter school,
the district of residence is responsible for transportation.
    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 120A.22, subdivision 11, is amended to read:
   Subd. 11. Assessment of performance. (a) Each year the performance of every child ages
seven through 16 who is not enrolled in a public school must be assessed using a nationally
norm-referenced standardized achievement examination. The superintendent of the district in
which the child receives instruction and the person in charge of the child's instruction must agree
about the specific examination to be used and the administration and location of the examination.
    (b) To the extent the examination in paragraph (a) does not provide assessment in all of the
subject areas in subdivision 9, the parent must assess the child's performance in the applicable
subject area. This requirement applies only to a parent who provides instruction and does not meet
the requirements of subdivision 10, clause (1), (2), or (3).
    (c) If the results of the assessments in paragraphs (a) and (b) indicate that the child's performance
on the total battery score is at or below the 30th percentile or one grade level below the performance
level for children of the same age, the parent must obtain additional evaluation of the child's abilities
and performance for the purpose of determining whether the child has learning problems.
    (d) A child receiving instruction from a nonpublic school, person, or institution that is
accredited by an accrediting agency, recognized according to section 123B.445, or recognized by
the commissioner, is exempt from the requirements of this subdivision.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 120A.24, subdivision 1, is amended to

     (4) by October 1 after a new resident district is established.
   (b) The person or nonpublic school in charge of providing instruction to a child between the
ages of seven and 16 must submit, by October 1 of each school year, a letter of intent to continue to
provide instruction under this section for all students under the person's or school's supervision and
any changes to the information required in paragraph (a) for each student.
    (c) The superintendent may collect the required information under this section through an
electronic or Web-based format, but must not require electronic submission of information under
this section from the person in charge of reporting under this subdivision.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 120B.07, is amended to read:

required courses or standards may, with the approval of the student, the student's parent or guardian,

alternative teacher professional pay system under this subdivision and section 122A.414. For fiscal
year 2007 and later, a qualifying district, intermediate school district, school site, or charter school
that received alternative teacher compensation aid for the previous fiscal year must receive at least
an amount of alternative teacher compensation revenue equal to the lesser of the amount it received
for the previous fiscal year or the amount it qualifies for under subdivision 1 for the current fiscal
year if the district, intermediate school district, school site, or charter school submits a timely
application and the commissioner determines that the district, intermediate school district, school
site, or charter school continues to implement an alternative teacher professional pay system,
consistent with its application under this section.
    (b) The commissioner shall approve applications that comply with subdivision 1, and section
122A.414, subdivisions 2, paragraph (b), and 2a, if the applicant is a charter school, in the order
in which they are received, select applicants that qualify for this program, notify school districts,
intermediate school districts, school sites, and charter schools about the program, develop and
disseminate application materials, and carry out other activities needed to implement this section.

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 123B.92, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Alternative attendance programs. (a) A district that enrolls nonresident pupils in
programs under sections 123A.05 to 123A.08, 124D.03, 124D.08, and 124D.68, must provide
authorized transportation to the pupil within the attendance area for the school that the pupil
attends at the same level of service that is provided to resident pupils within the attendance area.
The resident district need not provide or pay for transportation between the pupil's residence and
the district's border.
    (b) A district may provide transportation to allow a student who attends a high-need English
language learner program and who resides within the transportation attendance area of the program
to continue in the program until the student completes the highest grade level offered by the program.
   (c) A homeless nonresident pupil enrolled under section 124D.08, subdivision 2a, must be
provided transportation from the pupil's district of residence to and from the school of enrollment.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 124D.08, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2a. Continued enrollment for homeless students. Notwithstanding subdivision 2, a pupil
who has been enrolled in a district, who is identified as homeless, and whose parent or legal guardian
moves to another district, may continue to enroll in the nonresident district without the approval of
the board of the nonresident district. The approval of the board of the pupil's resident district is not
required.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 124D.09, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5a. Authorization; career or technical education. A 10th, 11th, or 12th grade pupil
enrolled in a district or an American Indian-controlled tribal contract or grant school eligible for
aid under section 124D.83, except a foreign exchange pupil enrolled in a district under a cultural
exchange program, may enroll in a career or technical education course offered by a Minnesota
state college or university. A 10th grade pupil applying for enrollment in a career or technical
education course under this subdivision must have received a passing score on the 8th grade
Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment in reading as a condition of enrollment. A secondary pupil
may enroll in their first postsecondary options enrollment course under this subdivision. A student
who is refused enrollment by a Minnesota state college or university under this subdivision, may
apply to an eligible institution offering a career or technical education course or a college or
university registered under chapter 136A by the Office of Higher Education that is eligible to
receive state student aid. The postsecondary institution must give priority to its students according
to subdivision 9. If a secondary student receives a grade of "C" or better in the career or technical
education course taken under this subdivision, the postsecondary institution must allow the student
to take additional secondary courses at that institution, not to exceed the limits in subdivision 8. A
"career or technical course" is a course that is part of a career and technical education program that
provides individuals with coherent, rigorous content aligned with academic standards and relevant
technical knowledge and skills needed to prepare for further education and careers in current and
emerging professions and provide technical skill proficiency, an industry recognized credential,
and a certificate, diploma, or an associate degree.

section.
    A district shall grant academic credit to a pupil enrolled in a course for secondary credit if the
pupil successfully completes the course. Seven quarter or four semester college credits equal at
least one full year of high school credit. Fewer college credits may be prorated. A district must also
grant academic credit to a pupil enrolled in a course for postsecondary credit if secondary credit is
requested by a pupil. If no comparable course is offered by the district, the district must, as soon as
possible, notify the commissioner, who shall determine the number of credits that shall be granted
to a pupil who successfully completes a course. If a comparable course is offered by the district, the
school board shall grant a comparable number of credits to the pupil. If there is a dispute between
the district and the pupil regarding the number of credits granted for a particular course, the pupil
may appeal the board's decision to the commissioner. The commissioner's decision regarding the
number of credits shall be final.
    The secondary credits granted to a pupil must be counted toward the graduation requirements
and subject area requirements of the district. Evidence of successful completion of each course and
secondary credits granted must be included in the pupil's secondary school record. A pupil shall
provide the school with a copy of the pupil's grade in each course taken for secondary credit under
this section. Upon the request of a pupil, the pupil's secondary school record must also include
evidence of successful completion and credits granted for a course taken for postsecondary credit.
In either case, the record must indicate that the credits were earned at a postsecondary institution.
    If a pupil enrolls in a postsecondary institution after leaving secondary school, the postsecondary
institution must award postsecondary credit for any course successfully completed for secondary
credit at that institution. Other postsecondary institutions may award, after a pupil leaves secondary
school, postsecondary credit for any courses successfully completed under this section. An
institution may not charge a pupil for the award of credit.
    The Board of Trustees of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities and the Board of
Regents of the University of Minnesota must, and private nonprofit and proprietary postsecondary
institutions should, award postsecondary credit for any successfully completed courses in a program
certified by the National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships offered according to an
agreement under subdivision 10.

   Subd. 13. Financial arrangements. For a pupil enrolled in a course under this section, the
department must make payments according to this subdivision for courses that were taken for
secondary credit.
    The department must not make payments to a school district or postsecondary institution
for a course taken for postsecondary credit only. The department must not make payments to a
postsecondary institution for a course from which a student officially withdraws during the first
14 days of the quarter or semester or who has been absent from the postsecondary institution for
the first 15 consecutive school days of the quarter or semester and is not receiving instruction in
the home or hospital.
    A postsecondary institution, including a college or university under subdivision 5a, shall receive
the following:
    (1) for an institution granting quarter credit, the reimbursement per credit hour shall be an amount
equal to 88 percent of the product of the formula allowance minus $415, multiplied by 1.3, and
divided by 45; or
   (2) for an institution granting semester credit, the reimbursement per credit hour shall be an
amount equal to 88 percent of the product of the general revenue formula allowance minus $415,
multiplied by 1.3, and divided by 30.
    The department must pay to each postsecondary institution 100 percent of the amount in clause
(1) or (2) within 30 days of receiving initial enrollment information each quarter or semester. If
changes in enrollment occur during a quarter or semester, the change shall be reported by the
postsecondary institution at the time the enrollment information for the succeeding quarter or
semester is submitted. At any time the department notifies a postsecondary institution that an
overpayment has been made, the institution shall promptly remit the amount due.

postsecondary credit. The pupil is enrolled full time if the pupil attends credit-bearing classes in the
high school or high school program for all of the available hours of instruction.

charter school is subject to and must comply with sections 15.054; 118A.01; 118A.02; 118A.03;
118A.04; 118A.05; 118A.06; 471.38; 471.391; 471.392; and 471.425. The audit must comply with

     ­­) Critical to schools' educational success is ongoing advanced placement/international
baccalaureate-approved teacher training. A secondary teacher assigned by a district to teach
an advanced placement or international baccalaureate course or other interested educator may
participate in a training program offered by The College Board or International Baccalaureate
North America, Inc. The state may pay a portion of the tuition, room, board, and out-of-state
travel costs a teacher or other interested educator incurs in participating in a training program.
The commissioner shall determine application procedures and deadlines, select teachers and other
interested educators to participate in the training program, and determine the payment process
and amount of the subsidy. The procedures determined by the commissioner shall, to the extent
possible, ensure that advanced placement and international baccalaureate courses become available
in all parts of the state and that a variety of course offerings are available in school districts. This
subdivision does not prevent teacher or other interested educator participation in training programs
offered by The College Board or International Baccalaureate North America, Inc., when tuition
is paid by a source other than the state.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 120B.30, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Statewide testing. (a) The commissioner, with advice from experts with
appropriate technical qualifications and experience and stakeholders, consistent with subdivision
1a, shall include in the comprehensive assessment system, for each grade level to be tested,
state-constructed tests developed from and aligned with the state's required academic standards
under section 120B.021, include multiple choice questions, and be administered annually to all
students in grades 3 through 8. State-developed high school tests aligned with the state's required
academic standards under section 120B.021 and administered to all high school students in a
subject other than writing must include multiple choice questions. The commissioner shall establish
one or more months during which schools shall administer the tests to students each school year.
For students enrolled in grade 8 before the 2005-2006 school year, Minnesota basic skills tests

in reading, mathematics, and writing shall fulfill students' basic skills testing requirements for
a passing state notation. The passing scores of basic skills tests in reading and mathematics are
the equivalent of 75 percent correct for students entering grade 9 based on the first uniform test
administered in February 1998. Students who have not successfully passed a Minnesota basic skills
test by the end of the 2011-2012 school year must pass the graduation-required assessments for
diploma under paragraph (c), except that for the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 school years only, these
students may satisfy the state's graduation test requirement for math by complying with paragraph
(d), clauses (1) and (3).
    (b) The state assessment system must be aligned to the most recent revision of academic
standards as described in section 120B.023 in the following manner:
      (1) mathematics;
      (i) grades 3 through 8 beginning in the 2010-2011 school year; and
      (ii) high school level beginning in the 2013-2014 school year;
      (2) science; grades 5 and 8 and at the high school level beginning in the 2011-2012 school year;
and
   (3) language arts and reading; grades 3 through 8 and high school level beginning in the
2012-2013 school year.
    (c) For students enrolled in grade 8 in the 2005-2006 school year and later, only the following
options shall fulfill students' state graduation test requirements:
      (1) for reading and mathematics:
    (i) obtaining an achievement level equivalent to or greater than proficient as determined through
a standard setting process on the Minnesota comprehensive assessments in grade 10 for reading
and grade 11 for mathematics or achieving a passing score as determined through a standard setting
process on the graduation-required assessment for diploma in grade 10 for reading and grade 11 for
mathematics or subsequent retests;
    (ii) achieving a passing score as determined through a standard setting process on the
state-identified language proficiency test in reading and the mathematics test for English language
learners or the graduation-required assessment for diploma equivalent of those assessments for
students designated as English language learners;
    (iii) achieving an individual passing score on the graduation-required assessment for diploma as
determined by appropriate state guidelines for students with an individualized education program
or 504 plan;
    (iv) obtaining achievement level equivalent to or greater than proficient as determined through
a standard setting process on the state-identified alternate assessment or assessments in grade 10 for
reading and grade 11 for mathematics for students with an individualized education program; or
    (v) achieving an individual passing score on the state-identified alternate assessment or
assessments as determined by appropriate state guidelines for students with an individualized
education program; and

   (2) for writing:
   (i) achieving a passing score on the graduation-required assessment for diploma;
    (ii) achieving a passing score as determined through a standard setting process on the
state-identified language proficiency test in writing for students designated as English language
learners;
    (iii) achieving an individual passing score on the graduation-required assessment for diploma as
determined by appropriate state guidelines for students with an individualized education program
or 504 plan; or
    (iv) achieving an individual passing score on the state-identified alternate assessment or
assessments as determined by appropriate state guidelines for students with an individualized
education program.
    (d) Students enrolled in grade 8 in any school year from the 2005-2006 school year to the
2009-2010 school year who do not pass the mathematics graduation-required assessment for
diploma under paragraph (c) are eligible to receive a high school diploma if they:
    (1) complete with a passing score or grade all state and local coursework and credits required
for graduation by the school board granting the students their diploma;
   (2) participate in district-prescribed academic remediation in mathematics; and
   (3) fully participate in at least two retests of the mathematics GRAD test or until they pass the
mathematics GRAD test, whichever comes first. A school, district, or charter school must place
on the high school transcript a student's current pass status for each subject that has a required
graduation assessment.
    In addition, the school board granting the students their diplomas may formally decide to
include a notation of high achievement on the high school diplomas of those graduating seniors
who, according to established school board criteria, demonstrate exemplary academic achievement
during high school.
    (e) The 3rd through 8th grade and high school test results shall be available to districts for
diagnostic purposes affecting student learning and district instruction and curriculum, and for
establishing educational accountability. The commissioner must disseminate to the public the high
school test results upon receiving those results.
    (f) The 3rd through 8th grade and high school tests must be aligned with state academic
standards. The commissioner shall determine the testing process and the order of administration.
The statewide results shall be aggregated at the site and district level, consistent with subdivision
1a.
   (g) In addition to the testing and reporting requirements under this section, the commissioner
shall include the following components in the statewide public reporting system:
    (1) uniform statewide testing of all students in grades 3 through 8 and at the high school level
that provides appropriate, technically sound accommodations or alternate assessments;
   (2) educational indicators that can be aggregated and compared across school districts and across

time on a statewide basis, including average daily attendance, high school graduation rates, and high
school drop-out rates by age and grade level;
   (3) state results on the American College Test; and
    (4) state results from participation in the National Assessment of Educational Progress so that
the state can benchmark its performance against the nation and other states, and, where possible,
against other countries, and contribute to the national effort to monitor achievement.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 122A.40, subdivision 5, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 5. Probationary period. (a) The first three consecutive years of a teacher's first teaching
experience in Minnesota in a single district is deemed to be a probationary period of employment,
and, the probationary period in each district in which the teacher is thereafter employed shall be one
year. The school board must adopt a plan for written evaluation of teachers during the probationary
period that is consistent with subdivision 8. Evaluation must occur at least three times periodically
throughout each school year for a teacher performing services during that school year; the first
evaluation must occur within the first 90 days of teaching service. Days devoted to parent-teacher
conferences, teachers' workshops, and other staff development opportunities and days on which
a teacher is absent from school must not be included in determining the number of school days
on which a teacher performs services. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), during the
probationary period any annual contract with any teacher may or may not be renewed as the school
board shall see fit. However, the board must give any such teacher whose contract it declines to

   (3) a mechanism to implement parental involvement programs under section 124D.895 and to
provide for effective parental communication and feedback on this involvement at the site level;
   (4) a provision that would allow the team to determine who is hired into licensed and nonlicensed
positions;
   (5) a provision that would allow teachers to choose the principal or other person having general
control;
   (6) an amount of revenue allocated to the site under subdivision 3; and

effect, that allows the site team to decide who is selected from within the district for licensed and
nonlicensed positions at the site and to make staff assignments in the site; and
    (3) includes a completed performance agreement under subdivision 4.
    The commissioner shall establish the form and manner of the application for a grant and annually,
at the end of each fiscal year, report to the house of representatives and senate committees having
jurisdiction over education on the progress of the program.
    Subd. 3. Revenue and cost allocation. Revenue for a fiscal year received or receivable by the
district shall be allocated to education sites based on the agreement between the school board and the
site decision-making team. Revenue shall remain allocated to each site until used by the site. The site
teams and the board may enter an agreement that permits the district to provide services and retain
the revenue required to pay for the services provided. The district remains responsible for legally
entering into contracts and expending funds. For the purposes of this subdivision, "allocation" means
that the determination of the use of the revenue shall be under the control of the site. The district may
charge the accounts of each site the actual costs of goods and services from the general or capital
funds attributable to the site.

approve applications using the criteria provided in subdivision 4 and shall not limit the applications
it solicits, considers, or approves to any single curriculum, learning program, or method.
     (c) An eligible authorizer under this subdivision must apply to the commissioner for approval as
an authorizer before submitting any affidavit to the commissioner to charter a school. The application
for approval as a charter school authorizer must demonstrate the applicant's ability to implement
the procedures and satisfy the criteria for chartering a school under this section. The commissioner
must approve or disapprove an application within 45 business days of the application deadline.
If the commissioner disapproves the application, the commissioner must notify the applicant of the
specific deficiencies in writing and the applicant then has 20 business days to address the deficiencies
to the commissioner's satisfaction. After the 20 business days expire, the commissioner has 15
business days to make a final decision to approve or disapprove the application. Failing to address
the deficiencies to the commissioner's satisfaction makes an applicant ineligible to be an authorizer.
The commissioner, in establishing criteria for approval, must consider the applicant's:
   (1) capacity and infrastructure;
   (2) application criteria and process;

   (3) contracting process;
   (4) ongoing oversight and evaluation processes; and

    (2) a description of the capacity of the organization to serve as an authorizer, including the
personnel who will perform the authorizing duties, their qualifications, the amount of time they will
be assigned to this responsibility, and the financial resources allocated by the organization to this
responsibility;
   (3) a description of the application and review process the authorizer will use to make decisions
regarding the granting of charters;
   (4) a description of the type of contract it will arrange with the schools it charters that meets the
provisions of subdivision 6;
   (5) the process to be used for providing ongoing oversight of the school consistent with the
contract expectations specified in clause (4) that assures that the schools chartered are complying
with both the provisions of applicable law and rules, and with the contract;
   (6) a description of the criteria and process the authorizer will use to grant expanded applications
under subdivision 4, paragraph (j);
   (7) the process for making decisions regarding the renewal or termination of the school's charter

school, including its success in increasing student achievement and meeting the goals of the charter
school agreement; and
    (8) an assurance specifying that the organization is committed to serving as an authorizer for the
full five-year term.
   (e) A disapproved applicant under this section may resubmit an application during a future
application period.

to charter a school.
    (i) The commissioner shall review an authorizer's performance every five years in a manner and
form determined by the commissioner and may review an authorizer's performance more frequently
at the commissioner's own initiative or at the request of a charter school operator, charter school
board member, or other interested party. The commissioner, after completing the review, shall
transmit a report with findings to the authorizer. If, consistent with this section, the commissioner
finds that an authorizer has not fulfilled the requirements of this section, the commissioner may
subject the authorizer to corrective action, which may include terminating the contract with the
charter school board of directors of a school it chartered. The commissioner must notify the
authorizer in writing of any findings that may subject the authorizer to corrective action and the
authorizer then has 15 business days to request an informal hearing before the commissioner takes
corrective action. If the commissioner terminates a contract between an authorizer and a charter
school under this paragraph, the commissioner may assist the charter school in acquiring a new
authorizer.
    (j) The commissioner may at any time take corrective action against an authorizer, including
terminating an authorizer's ability to charter a school for:
   (1) failing to demonstrate the criteria under paragraph (c) under which the commissioner
approved the authorizer;
    (2) violating a term of the chartering contract between the authorizer and the charter school board
of directors;
   (3) unsatisfactory performance as an approved authorizer; or
    (4) any good cause shown that provides the commissioner a legally sufficient reason to take
corrective action against an authorizer.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 124D.10, subdivision 4, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 4. Formation of school. (a) An authorizer, after receiving an application from a school
developer, may charter a licensed teacher under section 122A.18, subdivision 1, or a group of
individuals that includes one or more licensed teachers under section 122A.18, subdivision 1,
to operate a school subject to the commissioner's approval of the authorizer's affidavit under
paragraph (b). The school must be organized and operated as a nonprofit corporation under chapter
317A and the provisions under the applicable chapter shall apply to the school except as provided
in this section.
    Notwithstanding sections 465.717 and 465.719, a school district, subject to this section and
section 124D.11, may create a corporation for the purpose of establishing a charter school.
    (b) Before the operators may establish and operate a school, the authorizer must file an affidavit
with the commissioner stating its intent to charter a school. An authorizer must file a separate
affidavit for each school it intends to charter. The affidavit must state the terms and conditions
under which the authorizer would charter a school and how the authorizer intends to oversee the
fiscal and student performance of the charter school and to comply with the terms of the written
contract between the authorizer and the charter school board of directors under subdivision 6.
The commissioner must approve or disapprove the authorizer's affidavit within 60 business days
5598                                  JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                        [99TH DAY

of receipt of the affidavit. If the commissioner disapproves the affidavit, the commissioner shall
notify the authorizer of the deficiencies in the affidavit and the authorizer then has 20 business days
to address the deficiencies. If the authorizer does not address deficiencies to the commissioner's
satisfaction, the commissioner's disapproval is final. Failure to obtain commissioner approval
precludes an authorizer from chartering the school that is the subject of this affidavit.
    (c) The authorizer may prevent an approved charter school from opening for operation if, among
other grounds, the charter school violates this section or does not meet the ready-to-open standards
that are part of the authorizer's oversight and evaluation process or are stipulated in the charter
school contract.
    (d) The operators authorized to organize and operate a school, before entering into a contract
or other agreement for professional or other services, goods, or facilities, must incorporate as
a nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and must establish a board of directors composed
of at least five members who are not related parties until a timely election for members of the
ongoing charter school board of directors is held according to the school's articles and bylaws
under paragraph (f). A charter school board of directors must be composed of at least five members
who are not related parties. Staff members employed at the school, including teachers providing
instruction under a contract with a cooperative, and all parents or legal guardians of children
enrolled in the school are the voters eligible to elect the members of the school's board of directors.
A charter school must notify eligible voters of the school board election dates at least 30 days
before the election. Board of director meetings must comply with chapter 13D.

of at least five nonrelated members and include: (i) at least one licensed teacher employed at the
school or a licensed teacher providing instruction under contract between the charter school and a
cooperative; (ii) the parent or legal guardian of a student enrolled in the charter school who is not
an employee of the charter school; and (iii) an interested community member who is not employed
by the charter school and does not have a child enrolled in the school. The board may be a teacher
majority board composed of teachers described in this paragraph. The chief financial officer and the
chief administrator may only serve as ex-officio nonvoting board members and may not serve as
a voting member of the board. Charter school employees shall not serve on the board unless item
(i) applies. Contractors providing facilities, goods, or services to a charter school shall not serve on
the board of directors of the charter school. Board bylaws shall outline the process and procedures
for changing the board's governance model, consistent with chapter 317A. A board may change its
governance model only:
   (1) by a majority vote of the board of directors and the licensed teachers employed by the
school, including licensed teachers providing instruction under a contract between the school and a
cooperative; and
   (2) with the authorizer's approval.
   Any change in board governance must conform with the board structure established under this
paragraph.
   (h) The granting or renewal of a charter by an authorizer must not be conditioned upon the
bargaining unit status of the employees of the school.
    (i) The granting or renewal of a charter school by an authorizer must not be contingent on
the charter school being required to contract, lease, or purchase services from the authorizer.
Any potential contract, lease, or purchase of service from an authorizer must be disclosed to the
commissioner, accepted through an open bidding process, and be a separate contract from the
charter contract. The school must document the open bidding process. An authorizer must not enter
into a contract to provide management and financial services for a school that it authorizes, unless
the school documents that it received at least two competitive bids.
    (j) An authorizer may permit the board of directors of a charter school to expand the operation
of the charter school to additional sites or to add additional grades at the school beyond those
described in the authorizer's original affidavit as approved by the commissioner only after submitting
a supplemental affidavit for approval to the commissioner in a form and manner prescribed by the
commissioner. The supplemental affidavit must document that:

    (l) A charter school operating under this section may merge with another charter school. The
merger must comply with chapter 317A and section 124D.11, subdivision 9, paragraph (g). Upon
a formal vote of the board of directors of each charter school involved and written notice of intent
to the authorizer of each school, the schools may negotiate a merger plan that must include at least
the following:
    (1) a merger budget, a multiyear operating budget for the merged charter school, a long-range
financial plan, and a plan for the transfer of assets and liabilities to the merged charter school;
    (2) a process for transitioning responsibility of governance, administration, and all operations to
the merged charter school;
   (3) a statement of academic, student engagement, and organizational operations goals for the
merged charter school; and
   (4) an agreement between involved authorizers on the authorizing plan for the merged charter
school.
    The approval of the boards of directors of the merging charter schools, the authorizers of those
schools, and the authorizer of the merged charter school is required to adopt the merger plan. After
the merger plan is adopted, the authorizer of the merged charter school must submit the plan to the
commissioner for review and comment. The commissioner must complete the review and comment
of the plan within 30 business days. The merger may not take effect until the commissioner
completes the review and comment.

   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 124D.10, subdivision 23, is amended to
read:
     Subd. 23. Causes for nonrenewal or termination of charter school contract. (a) The duration
of the contract with an authorizer must be for the term contained in the contract according to
subdivision 6. The authorizer may or may not renew a contract at the end of the term for any ground
listed in paragraph (b). An authorizer may unilaterally terminate a contract during the term of the
contract for any ground listed in paragraph (b). At least 60 business days before not renewing or
terminating a contract, the authorizer shall notify the board of directors of the charter school of the
proposed action in writing. The notice shall state the grounds for the proposed action in reasonable
detail and that the charter school's board of directors may request in writing an informal hearing
before the authorizer within 15 business days of receiving notice of nonrenewal or termination of
the contract. Failure by the board of directors to make a written request for an informal hearing
within the 15-business-day period shall be treated as acquiescence to the proposed action. Upon
receiving a timely written request for a hearing, the authorizer shall give ten business days' notice to
the charter school's board of directors of the hearing date. The authorizer shall conduct an informal
hearing before taking final action. The authorizer shall take final action to renew or not renew a
contract no later than 20 business days before the proposed date for terminating the contract or the
end date of the contract.
   (b) A contract may be terminated or not renewed upon any of the following grounds:
   (1) failure to meet the requirements for pupil performance contained in the contract;
   (2) failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal management;
   (3) violations of law; or
   (4) other good cause shown.

school and the existing authorizer, and after providing an opportunity for a public hearing, may
terminate the existing contract between the authorizer and the charter school board if the charter
school has a history of:
     (1) failure to meet pupil performance requirements consistent with state law;
  (2) financial mismanagement or failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal
management; or
     (3) repeated or major violations of the law.

   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 126C.40, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. To lease building or land. (a) When an independent or a special school district
or a group of independent or special school districts finds it economically advantageous to rent
or lease a building or land for any instructional purposes or for school storage or furniture repair,
and it determines that the operating capital revenue authorized under section 126C.10, subdivision
13, is insufficient for this purpose, it may apply to the commissioner for permission to make an
additional capital expenditure levy for this purpose. An application for permission to levy under
this subdivision must contain financial justification for the proposed levy, the terms and conditions
of the proposed lease, and a description of the space to be leased and its proposed use.
    (b) The criteria for approval of applications to levy under this subdivision must include: the
reasonableness of the price, the appropriateness of the space to the proposed activity, the feasibility
of transporting pupils to the leased building or land, conformity of the lease to the laws and rules
of the state of Minnesota, and the appropriateness of the proposed lease to the space needs and the
financial condition of the district. The commissioner must not authorize a levy under this subdivision
in an amount greater than the cost to the district of renting or leasing a building or land for approved
purposes. The proceeds of this levy must not be used for custodial or other maintenance services.
A district may not levy under this subdivision for the purpose of leasing or renting a district-owned
building or site to itself.
    (c) For agreements finalized after July 1, 1997, a district may not levy under this subdivision
for the purpose of leasing: (1) a newly constructed building used primarily for regular kindergarten,
elementary, or secondary instruction; or (2) a newly constructed building addition or additions used
primarily for regular kindergarten, elementary, or secondary instruction that contains more than 20
percent of the square footage of the previously existing building.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), a district may levy under this subdivision for the purpose
of leasing or renting a district-owned building or site to itself only if the amount is needed by the
district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement, installment purchase agreement,
or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, and the levy meets the requirements of
paragraph (c). A levy authorized for a district by the commissioner under this paragraph may be
in the amount needed by the district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement,
installment purchase agreement, or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, provided
that any agreement include a provision giving the school districts the right to terminate the agreement
annually without penalty.
    (e) The total levy under this subdivision for a district for any year must not exceed $150 times
the resident pupil units for the fiscal year to which the levy is attributable.
   (f) For agreements for which a review and comment have been submitted to the Department of
Education after April 1, 1998, the term "instructional purpose" as used in this subdivision excludes
expenditures on stadiums.
   (g) The commissioner of education may authorize a school district to exceed the limit in
paragraph (e) if the school district petitions the commissioner for approval. The commissioner

shall grant approval to a school district to exceed the limit in paragraph (e) for not more than five
years if the district meets the following criteria:
   (1) the school district has been experiencing pupil enrollment growth in the preceding five years;
   (2) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term public interest;
   (3) the purpose of the increased levy promotes colocation of government services; and
   (4) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term interest of the district by avoiding over
construction of school facilities.
    (h) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with leases of administrative and classroom space
for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed $43 times the adjusted
marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to any other authority
authorized under this section.
    (i) In addition to the allowable capital levies in paragraph (a), for taxes payable in 2012 to
2023, a district that is a member of the "Technology and Information Education Systems" data
processing joint board, that finds it economically advantageous to enter into a lease agreement to
finance improvements to a building and land for a group of school districts or special school districts
for staff development purposes, may levy for its portion of lease costs attributed to the district within
the total levy limit in paragraph (e). The total levy authority under this paragraph shall not exceed
$632,000.
    (j) In addition to the allowable capital levies in paragraph (a), a school district that is a member
of the St. Croix River Education District that finds it economically advantageous to enter into a lease
purchase agreement for a building and land for the St. Croix River Education District may levy for
its portion of lease costs attributed to the district within the total levy limit in paragraph (e). The
authority under this paragraph is effective for taxes payable in 2013 to 2028.

  "Section 1. [145.417] LICENSURE OF CERTAIN FACILITIES THAT PERFORM

    Subdivision 1. License required for facilities that perform ten or more abortions per month.
(a) A clinic, health center, or other facility in which the pregnancies of ten or more women known
to be pregnant are willfully terminated or aborted each month shall be licensed by the commissioner
of health and, notwithstanding Minnesota Rules, part 4675.0100, subparts 8 and 9, subject to the
licensure requirements provided in Minnesota Rules, chapter 4675. The commissioner shall not
require a facility licensed as a hospital or as an outpatient surgical center, pursuant to sections
144.50 to 144.56, to obtain a separate license under this section, but may subject these facilities
to inspections and investigations as permitted under subdivision 2.
    (b) The establishment or operation of a facility described in this section without obtaining a
license is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $300. The commissioner of health,
the attorney general, an appropriate county attorney, or a woman upon whom an abortion has been
performed or attempted to be performed at an unlicensed facility may seek an injunction in district
court against the continued operation of the facility. Proceedings for securing an injunction may be
brought by the attorney general or by the appropriate county attorney.
   (c) Sanctions provided in this subdivision do not restrict other available sanctions.
    Subd. 2. Inspections; no notice required. No more than two times per year, the commissioner of
health shall perform routine and comprehensive inspections and investigations of facilities described
under subdivision 1. Every clinic, health center, or other facility described under subdivision 1, and
any other premise proposed to be conducted as a facility by an applicant for a license, shall be open
at all reasonable times to inspection authorized in writing by the commissioner of health. No notice
need be given to any person prior to any inspection.
    Subd. 3. Licensure fee. (a) The annual license fee for facilities required to be licensed under
this section is $3,712.
   (b) Fees shall be collected and deposited according to section 144.122.
    Subd. 4. Suspension, revocation, and refusal to renew. The commissioner of health may refuse
to grant or renew, or may suspend or revoke a license on any of the following grounds:
   (1) violation of any of the provisions of this section or Minnesota Rules, chapter 4675;
   (2) permitting, aiding, or abetting the commission of any illegal act in the facility;
5628                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [99TH DAY

   (3) conduct or practices detrimental to the welfare of the patient;
   (4) obtaining or attempting to obtain a license by fraud or misrepresentation; or
    (5) if there is a pattern of conduct that involves one or more physicians in the facility who have a
financial or economic interest in the facility, as defined in section 144.6521, subdivision 3, and who
have not provided notice and disclosure of the financial or economic interest as required by section
144.6521.
    Subd. 5. Hearing. Prior to any suspension, revocation, or refusal to renew a license, the licensee
shall be entitled to notice and a hearing as provided by sections 14.57 to 14.69. At each hearing, the
commissioner of health shall have the burden of establishing that a violation described in subdivision
4 has occurred. If a license is revoked, suspended, or not renewed, a new application for license may
be considered by the commissioner if the conditions upon which revocation, suspension, or refusal
to renew was based have been corrected and evidence of this fact has been satisfactorily furnished. A
new license may be granted after proper inspection has been made and all provisions of this section
and Minnesota Rules, chapter 4675, have been complied with and a recommendation for licensure
has been made by the commissioner or by an inspector as an agent of the commissioner.
    Subd. 6. Severability. If any one or more provision, section, subdivision, sentence, clause,
phrase, or word of this section or the application of it to any person or circumstance is found to be
unconstitutional, it is declared to be severable and the balance of this section shall remain effective
notwithstanding such unconstitutionality. The legislature intends that it would have passed this
section, and each provision, section, subdivision, sentence, clause, phrase, or word, regardless of
the fact that any one provision, section, subdivision, sentence, clause, phrase, or word is declared
unconstitutional.
   Sec. 2. APPROPRIATION.
    $63,000 is appropriated in fiscal year 2013 from the state government special revenue fund to
the commissioner of health for licensing activities under Minnesota Statutes, section 145.417."
