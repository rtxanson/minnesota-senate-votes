to engage in harmful sexual conduct if placed on a conditional release with appropriate terms and
conditions.
    (b) If the court finds that the conditional release of a proposed patient is appropriate, the court
shall notify the Minnesota sex offender program, which must prepare a plan that identifies the
treatment and services that the patient will receive in the community and includes recommendations
regarding the conditions of the release. The plan must be presented to the court for its approval
within 60 days after the court finds that a conditional release is appropriate, unless the program and
the patient request additional time to develop the plan.
   (c) An order for conditional release places the patient in the custody and control of the
commissioner of human services for the provision of treatment, services, and supervision under the
Minnesota sex offender program and the patient is subject to the conditions set by the court and the
program. At a minimum, these conditions must include requirements that the patient:
   (1) report to or appear before an individual or agency as directed by the court or the program;
   (2) comply with any applicable registration requirements under section 243.166;
   (3) not commit a crime or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon;
    (4) not leave the state without the consent of the court or, in circumstances in which the reason
for the absence is of such an emergency nature that prior consent by the court is not possible, without
the consent of the program;
    (5) attend and fully participate in assessment, treatment, and behavior monitoring, including
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment specific to sex offenders, or chemical dependency
treatment, based on the plan approved by the court under paragraph (b);
   (6) submit to the search of the patient's person, residence, vehicle, or any personal or real property
under the patient's control at any time by the program;
    (7) refrain from having any contact, including written or oral communications, directly or
indirectly, with certain specified individuals, including a victim of a crime committed by the patient
or the victim's family; and
   (8) not establish any living arrangement or residence without prior approval of the program.
    (d) If the program determines that a patient released under this subdivision has violated a
condition of release or is exhibiting behavior that may be dangerous to self or others or that
the interests of public safety requires that the conditional release be revoked, the program may
request the court to issue an emergency ex parte order directing a law enforcement agency to
take the person into custody and transport the person to a Department of Corrections or county
correctional or detention facility or a secure treatment facility. The county attorney or the program
shall submit a statement showing probable cause for the detention and submit a petition to revoke
the conditional release order within 48 hours after the detention. The court shall hear the petition
within 30 days, unless the hearing or deadline is waived by the patient. If the court determines
that a condition of release has been violated or that the safety of the patient or others requires that
the conditional release be revoked, the court shall revoke the conditional release and order an
appropriate commitment placement under this section.

   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 340A.301, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6b. Brewer taproom license. (a) A municipality may issue the holder of a brewer's license
under subdivision 6, clause (c), (i), or (j), a brewer taproom license. A brewer taproom license
authorizes on-sale of malt liquor produced by the brewer for consumption on the premises of or
adjacent to one brewery location owned by the brewer. Nothing in this subdivision precludes the
holder of a brewer taproom license from also holding a license to operate a restaurant at the brewery.
Section 340A.409 shall apply to a license issued under this subdivision. All provisions of this chapter
that apply to a retail liquor license shall apply to a license issued under this subdivision unless the
provision is explicitly inconsistent with this subdivision.
  (b) A brewer may only have one taproom license under this subdivision, and may not have an
ownership interest in a brewery licensed under subdivision 6, clause (d).
    (c) A municipality may not issue a brewer taproom license to a brewer if the brewer seeking the
license, or any person having an economic interest in the brewer seeking the license or exercising
control over the brewer seeking the license, is a brewer that brews more than 250,000 barrels of
malt liquor annually or a winery that produces more than 250,000 gallons of wine annually.
   (d) The municipality shall impose a licensing fee on a brewer holding a brewer taproom license
under this subdivision, subject to limitations applicable to license fees under section 340A.408,
subdivision 2, paragraph (a).
    (e) A municipality shall, within ten days of the issuance of a license under this subdivision,
inform the commissioner of the licensee's name and address and trade name, and the effective date
and expiration date of the license. The municipality shall also inform the commissioner of a license
transfer, cancellation, suspension, or revocation during the license period.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 340A.301, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 6c. Microdistillery fee. The commissioner shall establish a fee for licensing
microdistilleries that adequately covers the cost of issuing the license and other inspection
requirements. The fees shall be deposited in an account in the special revenue fund and are
appropriated to the commissioner for the purposes of this subdivision.

an auto racing facility located in the city. The license may authorize sales both to persons attending
any and all events at the facility, and sales in a restaurant, bar, or banquet facility located on the
premises of the auto racing facility. The license authorizes sales on all days of the week. The license
may be issued for a space that is not compact and contiguous, provided that the licensed premises
may include only the space within a defined area as described in the application for the license.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 340A.404, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5a. Wine festival. A municipality with the approval of the commissioner may issue a
temporary license to a bona fide association of owners and operators of wineries sponsoring an
annual festival to showcase wines produced by members of the association. The license issued under
this subdivision authorizes the sale of table, sparkling, or fortified wines produced by the wineries
at on-sale by the glass, or off-sale by the bottle, and the dispensing of free samples of the wines
offered for sale within designated premises of the festival. Off-sales of wine under this subdivision
shall be limited to two bottles or less per customer. A license issued under this subdivision is subject
to all laws and ordinances governing the sale, possession, and consumption of table, sparkling, or
fortified wines. For purposes of this subdivision, a "bona fide association of owners and operators of
wineries" means an association of more than ten wineries that has been in existence for more than
two years at the time of application for the temporary license.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 340A.404, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

may issue to a farm winery licensed under section 340A.315 a temporary license for the on-sale at a
county fair located within the municipality of intoxicating liquor produced by the farm winery. The
licenses are subject to the terms, including a license fee, imposed by the issuing municipality and
all laws and ordinances governing the sale of intoxicating liquor not inconsistent with this section.
Licenses under this subdivision are not valid unless first approved by the commissioner of public
safety.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 340A.404, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

the governing body of a municipality may issue an on-sale intoxicating liquor license to a private,
nonprofit college located within the municipality, or to any entity holding a caterer's permit and a
contract with the private, nonprofit college for catering on the premises of the private, nonprofit
college, or for any portion of the premises as described in the approved license application. The
license authorized by this subdivision may be issued for space that is not compact and contiguous,
provided that all such space is included in the description of the licensed premises on the approved
license application. The license authorizes sales on all days of the week to persons attending events
at the private, nonprofit college. All other provisions of this chapter not inconsistent with this section
apply to the license authorized under this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 340A.412, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
