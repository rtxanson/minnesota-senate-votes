or a group of independent or special school districts finds it economically advantageous to rent
or lease a building or land for any instructional purposes or for school storage or furniture repair,
and it determines that the operating capital revenue authorized under section 126C.10, subdivision
13, is insufficient for this purpose, it may apply to the commissioner for permission to make an
additional capital expenditure levy for this purpose. An application for permission to levy under
this subdivision must contain financial justification for the proposed levy, the terms and conditions
of the proposed lease, and a description of the space to be leased and its proposed use.
    (b) The criteria for approval of applications to levy under this subdivision must include: the
reasonableness of the price, the appropriateness of the space to the proposed activity, the feasibility
of transporting pupils to the leased building or land, conformity of the lease to the laws and rules
of the state of Minnesota, and the appropriateness of the proposed lease to the space needs and the
financial condition of the district. The commissioner must not authorize a levy under this subdivision
in an amount greater than the cost to the district of renting or leasing a building or land for approved
purposes. The proceeds of this levy must not be used for custodial or other maintenance services.
A district may not levy under this subdivision for the purpose of leasing or renting a district-owned
building or site to itself.

for the purpose of leasing: (1) a newly constructed building used primarily for regular kindergarten,
elementary, or secondary instruction; or (2) a newly constructed building addition or additions used

percent of the square footage of the previously existing building.

of leasing or renting a district-owned building or site to itself only if the amount is needed by the
district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement, installment purchase agreement,
or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, and the levy meets the requirements of
paragraph (c). A levy authorized for a district by the commissioner under this paragraph may be
in the amount needed by the district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement,

   (1) the school district has been experiencing pupil enrollment growth in the preceding five years;
   (2) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term public interest;
   (3) the purpose of the increased levy promotes colocation of government services; and

construction of school facilities.
    (h) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with leases of administrative and classroom space
for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed $43 times the adjusted
marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to any other authority
authorized under this section.
    (i) In addition to the allowable capital levies in paragraph (a), for taxes payable in 2012 to
2023, a district that is a member of the "Technology and Information Education Systems" data
processing joint board, that finds it economically advantageous to enter into a lease agreement to
finance improvements to a building and land for a group of school districts or special school districts
for staff development purposes, may levy for its portion of lease costs attributed to the district within
the total levy limit in paragraph (e). The total levy authority under this paragraph shall not exceed

   Pursuant to Rule 45, the Committee on Rules and Administration recommends that H.F. No.

    Delete all the language after the enacting clause of H.F. No. 2078, the first engrossment; and
insert the language after the enacting clause of S.F. No. 1990, the first engrossment; further, delete
the title of H.F. No. 2078, the first engrossment; and insert the title of S.F. No. 1990, the first

    And when so amended H.F. No. 2078 will be identical to S.F. No. 1990, and further recommends
that H.F. No. 2078 be given its second reading and substituted for S.F. No. 1990, and that the Senate
