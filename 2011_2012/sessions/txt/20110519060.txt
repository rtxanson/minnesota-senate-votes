   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103G.615, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Fees. (a) The commissioner shall establish a fee schedule for permits to control or
harvest aquatic plants other than wild rice. The fees must be set by rule, and section 16A.1283 does
not apply, but the rule must not take effect until 45 legislative days after it has been reported to the
legislature. The fees shall not exceed $2,500 per permit and shall be based upon the cost of receiving,
processing, analyzing, and issuing the permit, and additional costs incurred after the application to
inspect and monitor the activities authorized by the permit, and enforce aquatic plant management
rules and permit requirements.
   (b) A fee for a permit for the control of rooted aquatic vegetation for each contiguous parcel of
shoreline owned by an owner may be charged. This fee may not be charged for permits issued in
connection with purple loosestrife control or lakewide Eurasian water milfoil control programs.
   (c) A fee may not be charged to the state or a federal governmental agency applying for a permit.
   (d) A fee for a permit for the control of rooted aquatic vegetation in a public water basin that is
20 acres or less in size shall be one-half of the fee established under paragraph (a).

    (1) A = the number of pounds of a manufacturer's video display devices sold to households during
the previous program year, as reported to the department under section 115A.1316, subdivision 1;
     (2) B = the proportion of sales of video display devices required to be recycled, set at 0.6 for the
first program year and 0.8 for the second program year and every year thereafter;
   (3) C = the number of pounds of covered electronic devices recycled by a manufacturer
from households during the previous program year, as reported to the department under section
115A.1316, subdivision 1;
   (4) D = the number of recycling credits a manufacturer elects to use to calculate the variable
recycling fee, as reported to the department under section 115A.1316, subdivision 1; and
   (5) E = the estimated per-pound cost of recycling, initially set at $0.50 per pound for
manufacturers who recycle less than 50 percent of the product (A x B); $0.40 per pound for
manufacturers who recycle at least 50 percent but less than 90 percent of the product (A x B); and
$0.30 per pound for manufacturers who recycle at least 90 percent but less than 100 percent of the
product (A x B).
    (c) If, as specified in paragraph (b), the term C - (A x B) equals a positive number of pounds,
that amount is defined as the manufacturer's recycling credits. A manufacturer may retain recycling
credits to be added, in whole or in part, to the actual value of C, as reported under section 115A.1316,
subdivision 2, during any succeeding program year, provided that no more than 25 percent of a
manufacturer's obligation (A x B) for any program year may be met with recycling credits generated

in a prior program year. A manufacturer may sell any portion or all of its recycling credits to another
manufacturer, at a price negotiated by the parties, who may use the credits in the same manner.
    (d) For the purpose of calculating a manufacturer's variable recycling fee under paragraph (b),
the weight of covered electronic devices collected from households located outside the 11-county
metropolitan area, as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (c), is calculated at 1.5 times their actual
weight.
    (e) The registration fee for the initial program year and the base registration fee thereafter for a
manufacturer who produces fewer than 100 video display devices for sale annually to households
is $1,250.

alternatives to the proposed action and their impacts, and explores methods by which adverse
environmental impacts of an action could be mitigated. The environmental impact statement shall
also analyze those economic, employment and sociological effects that cannot be avoided should
the action be implemented. To ensure its use in the decision-making process, the environmental
impact statement shall be prepared as early as practical in the formulation of an action. No
mandatory environmental impact statement may be required for an ethanol plant, as defined in
section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), that produces less than 125,000,000 gallons of
ethanol annually and is located outside of the seven-county metropolitan area.
    (a) The board shall by rule establish categories of actions for which environmental impact
statements and for which environmental assessment worksheets shall be prepared as well as
categories of actions for which no environmental review is required under this section. A mandatory
environmental assessment worksheet shall not be required for the expansion of an ethanol plant,
as defined in section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), or the conversion of an ethanol plant
to a biobutanol facility or the expansion of a biobutanol facility, as defined in section 41A.105,
subdivision 1a, based on the capacity of the expanded or converted facility to produce alcohol fuel,
but must be required if the ethanol plant meets or exceeds thresholds of other categories of actions
for which environmental assessment worksheets must be prepared. The responsible governmental
unit for an ethanol plant project for which an environmental assessment worksheet is prepared

shall be the state agency with the greatest responsibility for supervising or approving the project
as a whole.
    (b) The responsible governmental unit shall promptly publish notice of the completion of
an environmental assessment worksheet in a manner to be determined by the board and shall
provide copies of the environmental assessment worksheet to the board and its member agencies.
Comments on the need for an environmental impact statement may be submitted to the responsible
governmental unit during a 30-day period following publication of the notice that an environmental
assessment worksheet has been completed. The responsible governmental unit's decision on the
need for an environmental impact statement shall be based on the environmental assessment
worksheet and the comments received during the comment period, and shall be made within 15
days after the close of the comment period. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not
more than 15 additional days upon the request of the responsible governmental unit.
    (c) An environmental assessment worksheet shall also be prepared for a proposed action
whenever material evidence accompanying a petition by not less than ­     25
                                                                           ­ 100 individuals who
reside or own property in the county or an adjoining county where the proposed action will be
located, submitted before the proposed project has received final approval by the appropriate
governmental units, demonstrates that, because of the nature or location of a proposed action,
there may be potential for significant environmental effects. Petitions requesting the preparation
of an environmental assessment worksheet shall be submitted to the board. The chair of the board
shall determine the appropriate responsible governmental unit and forward the petition to it. A
decision on the need for an environmental assessment worksheet shall be made by the responsible
governmental unit within 15 days after the petition is received by the responsible governmental
unit. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not more than 15 additional days upon
request of the responsible governmental unit.
   (d) Except in an environmentally sensitive location where Minnesota Rules, part 4410.4300,
subpart 29, item B, applies, the proposed action is exempt from environmental review under this
chapter and rules of the board, if:
   (1) the proposed action is:
   (i) an animal feedlot facility with a capacity of less than 1,000 animal units; or
   (ii) an expansion of an existing animal feedlot facility with a total cumulative capacity of less
than 1,000 animal units;
    (2) the application for the animal feedlot facility includes a written commitment by the proposer
to design, construct, and operate the facility in full compliance with Pollution Control Agency
feedlot rules; and
    (3) the county board holds a public meeting for citizen input at least ten business days prior
to the Pollution Control Agency or county issuing a feedlot permit for the animal feedlot facility
unless another public meeting for citizen input has been held with regard to the feedlot facility to be
permitted. The exemption in this paragraph is in addition to other exemptions provided under other
law and rules of the board.
   (e) The board may, prior to final approval of a proposed project, require preparation of an
environmental assessment worksheet by a responsible governmental unit selected by the board for

any action where environmental review under this section has not been specifically provided for by
rule or otherwise initiated.
    (f) An early and open process shall be utilized to limit the scope of the environmental impact
statement to a discussion of those impacts, which, because of the nature or location of the project,
have the potential for significant environmental effects. The same process shall be utilized to
determine the form, content and level of detail of the statement as well as the alternatives which
are appropriate for consideration in the statement. In addition, the permits which will be required
for the proposed action shall be identified during the scoping process. Further, the process shall
identify those permits for which information will be developed concurrently with the environmental
impact statement. The board shall provide in its rules for the expeditious completion of the scoping
process. The determinations reached in the process shall be incorporated into the order requiring
the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (g) The responsible governmental unit shall, to the extent practicable, avoid duplication and
ensure coordination between state and federal environmental review and between environmental
review and environmental permitting. Whenever practical, information needed by a governmental
unit for making final decisions on permits or other actions required for a proposed project shall be
developed in conjunction with the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (h) An environmental impact statement shall be prepared and its adequacy determined within
280 days after notice of its preparation unless the time is extended by consent of the parties or
by the governor for good cause. The responsible governmental unit shall determine the adequacy
of an environmental impact statement, unless within 60 days after notice is published that an
environmental impact statement will be prepared, the board chooses to determine the adequacy of
an environmental impact statement. If an environmental impact statement is found to be inadequate,
the responsible governmental unit shall have 60 days to prepare an adequate environmental impact
statement.
    (i) The proposer of a specific action may include in the information submitted to the responsible
governmental unit a preliminary draft environmental impact statement under this section on
that action for review, modification, and determination of completeness and adequacy by the
responsible governmental unit. A preliminary draft environmental impact statement prepared by
the project proposer and submitted to the responsible governmental unit shall identify or include as
an appendix all studies and other sources of information used to substantiate the analysis contained
in the preliminary draft environmental impact statement. The responsible governmental unit shall
require additional studies, if needed, and obtain from the project proposer all additional studies and
information necessary for the responsible governmental unit to perform its responsibility to review,
modify, and determine the completeness and adequacy of the environmental impact statement.

    Subd. 3. Surcharge. Each insurer engaged in the writing of policies of automobile insurance
shall collect a surcharge, at the rate of 50 cents per vehicle for every six months of coverage, on each
policy of automobile insurance providing comprehensive insurance coverage issued or renewed in
this state. The surcharge may not be considered premium for any purpose, including the computation
of premium tax or agents' commissions. The amount of the surcharge must be separately stated on
either a billing or policy declaration sent to an insured. Insurers shall remit the revenue derived from
this surcharge at least quarterly to the commissioner of public safety for purposes of the automobile
theft prevention program described in section 6    ­5

   (4) a motorcycle,
except that no vehicle with a gross vehicle weight in excess of 10,000 pounds is included within
this definition.
    Subd. 4. Automobile theft prevention account. A special revenue account is created in the
state treasury to be credited with the proceeds of the surcharge imposed under subdivision 3. Of
the revenue in the account, $1,300,000 each year must be transferred to the general fund. Revenues
in excess of $1,300,000 each year may be used only for the automobile theft prevention program
described in section 6­5

   Subd. 4. General elements of the plan. The plan must:
   (1) estimate 1990 and 2005 greenhouse gas emissions in the state and make projections of
emissions in 2015, 2025, and 2050;
    (2) identify, evaluate, and integrate a broad range of statewide greenhouse gas reduction options
for all emission sectors in the state;
   (3) assess the costs, benefits, and feasibility of implementing the options;
    (4) recommend an integrated set of reduction options and strategies for implementing the options
that will achieve the goals in subdivision 1, including analysis of the associated costs and benefits
to Minnesotans;
    (5) estimate the statewide greenhouse gas emissions reductions anticipated from implementation
of existing state policies; and
   (6) recommend a system to require the reporting of statewide greenhouse gas emissions,
identifying which facilities must report, and how emission estimates should be made;

     Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290.431, is amended to read:
     290.431 NONGAME WILDLIFE CHECKOFF.
      Every individual who files an income tax return or property tax refund claim form may designate
on their original return that $1 or more shall be added to the tax or deducted from the refund that
would otherwise be payable by or to that individual and paid into an account to be established for
the management of nongame wildlife. The commissioner of revenue shall, on the income tax return
and the property tax refund claim form, notify filers of their right to designate that a portion of
their tax or refund shall be paid into the nongame wildlife management account. The sum of the
amounts so designated to be paid shall be credited to the nongame wildlife management account for
use by the nongame program in the Department of Natural Resources. All interest earned on money
accrued, gifts to the program, contributions to the program, and reimbursements of expenditures in
the nongame wildlife management account shall be credited to the account by the commissioner of
management and budget, except that gifts or contributions received directly by the commissioner
of natural resources and directed by the contributor for use in specific nongame field projects or
geographic areas shall be handled according to section 84.085, subdivision 1. T                                   ­­ e­­

    The state pledges and agrees with all contributors to the nongame wildlife management account
to use the funds contributed solely for the management of nongame wildlife projects and further
agrees that it will not impose additional conditions or restrictions that will limit or otherwise restrict
the ability of the commissioner of natural resources to use the available funds for the most efficient
and effective management of nongame wildlife. The commissioner may use funds appropriated for
nongame wildlife programs for the purpose of developing, preserving, restoring, and maintaining
wintering habitat for neotropical migrant birds in Latin America and the Caribbean under agreement
or contract with any nonprofit organization dedicated to the construction, maintenance, and repair of
such projects that are acceptable to the governmental agency having jurisdiction over the land and
water affected by the projects. Under this authority, the commissioner may execute agreements and
contracts if the commissioner determines that the use of the funds will benefit neotropical migrant
birds that breed in or migrate through the state.

94.11 or 16B.283, the commissioner of finance may establish the timing of payments for land
purchased under this section. If the total of all money deposited into the general fund from the

    The rulemaking authority granted under Minnesota Statutes, section 116G.15, subdivision 7, is
explicitly repealed by this act and any rulemaking to effectuate the purpose of Laws 2009, chapter
172, article 2, section 27, commenced by the commissioner of natural resources under that authority
or any other authority is void and must cease on the effective date of this section.
   Sec. 47. WILD RICE RULEMAKING AND RESEARCH.
   (a) Upon completion of the research referenced in paragraph (d), the commissioner of the
Pollution Control Agency shall initiate a process to amend Minnesota Rules, chapter 7050. The
amended rule shall:
    (1) establish water quality standards for waters containing natural beds of wild rice, as well as
for irrigation waters used for the production of wild rice; and
    (2) designate each body of water, or specific portion thereof, to which the wild rice water quality
standard applies and the specific times of year during which the standard applies.
    (b) "Waters containing natural beds of wild rice" means waters where significant quantities of
wild rice occur naturally. Before designating waters containing natural beds of wild rice as waters
subject to a standard, the commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency shall establish criteria for
the waters after consultation with the Department of Natural Resources, Minnesota Indian tribes,
and other interested parties and after public notice and comment. The criteria shall include, but not
be limited to, documented history of wild rice harvests, minimum acreage, and wild rice density.
Waters where individual wild rice plants or isolated, sparse stands of wild rice exist shall not be
designated as subject to the standard.
    (c) Within 30 days of the effective date of this section, the commissioner of the Pollution
Control Agency must create an advisory group to provide input to the commissioner on a protocol
for scientific research to assess the impacts of sulfates and other substances on the growth of
wild rice, review research results, and provide other advice on the development of future rule
amendments to protect wild rice. The group must include representatives of tribal governments,
municipal wastewater treatment facilities, industrial dischargers, wild rice harvesters, wild rice
research experts, and citizen organizations.
   (d) After receiving the advice of the advisory group under paragraph (c), consultation with the
commissioner of natural resources, and review of all available scientific research on water quality
and other environmental impacts on the growth of wild rice, the commissioner of the Pollution

Control Agency shall adopt and implement a wild rice research plan using the money appropriated to
contract with appropriate scientific experts. The commissioner shall periodically review the results
of the research with the commissioner of natural resources and the advisory group.
    (e) To the extent allowable under the federal Clean Water Act, during the pendency of the rule
amendment described in paragraph (a), the Pollution Control Agency, with respect to permits issued
for the discharge of wastewater, shall exercise its powers under Minnesota Statutes, section 115.03,
subdivision 1, paragraph (e), to enter into schedules of compliance to ensure that no permittee is
required to expend funds for design and implementation of sulfate treatment technologies until after
the rule amendment is complete. Nothing shall prevent the Pollution Control Agency from including
in a schedule of compliance a requirement to monitor sulfate concentrations in discharges and, if
appropriate, based on site-specific conditions, a requirement to implement a sulfate minimization
plan to avoid or minimize sulfate concentrations during periods when wild rice may be susceptible
to damage.
    (f) To the extent that the commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency determines that
provisions of the federal Clean Water Act or other federal laws limits full implementation of
paragraph (e), the commissioner shall fully exercise the agency's authority under state and
federal law and regulations to ensure, to the fullest extent possible, that no permittee is required
to expend funds for design and implementation of sulfate treatment technologies until after
the rule amendment described in paragraph (a) is complete. If the commissioner determines
that amendments to Minnesota Rules are necessary to ensure that no permittee is required to
expend funds for design and implementation of sulfate treatment technologies until after the rule
amendment described in paragraph (a) is complete, the commissioner may use the good cause
exemption under Minnesota Statutes, section 14.388, subdivision 1, clause (3), to adopt rules
necessary to implement this section, and Minnesota Statutes, section 14.386, does not apply, except
as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 14.388.
    (g) Upon completion of the rule amendment described in paragraph (a), the Pollution Control
Agency shall modify the discharge limits in the affected wastewater discharge permits to reflect the
new standards in accordance with state and federal regulations and shall exercise its powers to enter
into schedules of compliance in the permits.
    (h) By December 15, 2011, the commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency shall submit
a report to the chairs and ranking minority members of the environment and natural resources
committees of the house of representatives and senate on the status of implementation of this section.
The report must include an estimated timeline for completion of the wild rice research plan and
initiation and completion of the formal rulemaking process under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 14.
    (i) To the extent allowable under the federal Clean Water Act, until the rule amendment described
in paragraph (a) is finally adopted, the agency shall suspend the standard for sulfate for class 4
waters.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 48. WATER RULEMAKING LEGISLATIVE REVIEW.
    Until June 30, 2013, all proposed rules related to water quality or water resource protection must
be consistent with other local, state, and federal rules, and must be able to achieve the legislatively
intended outcome as effectively and efficiently as possible. To ensure that all proposed rules

inconsistent or contrary to any existing rule and accept the proposing agency's jurisdiction over the
subject matter of the proposed rule.
    Within 60 days of receipt of the proposed water-related rule, the commission may notify the
agency proposing the rule that the commission agrees that the rule does not comply with the
legislative policy, that rules are not consistent with all other water-related rules, or the agency is
not the appropriate authority for jurisdiction over the proposed rules.
   Sec. 49. INTEREST IN LANDS EXTENDED.
    Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, Dakota County's reversionary interests in lands
deeded by Dakota County to the state of Minnesota, as contemplated by Laws 1975, chapter 382,
and currently maintained and used for the purposes of a state zoological garden in Apple Valley,
Minnesota, to wit, those lands described in documents recorded in the Dakota County Property
Records Office as Document No. 433980 and Document No. 439719, excluding lands subject to

projects that includes a priority ranking.
   (f) A grant award for a transit project located within the metropolitan area, as defined in section
473.121, subdivision 2, may be funded only after the Metropolitan Council reviews the project for
consistency with the transit portion of the Metropolitan Council policy plan and one of the following
occurs:
     (1) the Metropolitan Council finds the project to be consistent;

effort to resolve the inconsistency through negotiations with the joint powers board, agrees that the
grant award may be funded; or
    (3) the Metropolitan Council finds the project to be inconsistent, and submits the consistency
issue for final determination to a panel, which determines the project to be consistent. The panel is
composed of a member appointed by the chair of the Metropolitan Council, a member appointed by

   Sec. 13. [137.105] UNDERGRADUATE TUITION GUARANTEE PLAN.
    The Board of Regents is encouraged to offer students a guaranteed tuition plan that can provide
students a tuition option designed to meet the goals in this section. A Minnesota resident student
who first enrolls in a degree program at the University of Minnesota beginning in the fall of 2011
or later may be offered guaranteed stable tuition for up to four consecutive academic years. Under
the guaranteed plan, for an undergraduate student enrolled in a baccalaureate degree program, the
tuition charged to the student for each semester of enrollment during a four-year period, beginning
with the first semester of enrollment, must not exceed the amount of tuition that the student was
charged for the first semester of enrollment. For a student who continues to be enrolled after four
consecutive academic years, the tuition rate for each semester in excess of four years is equal to the
tuition rate paid by new enrollees at the University of Minnesota. Time limits for the stable tuition
plan under this section do not apply to a student in the military while the student is on active military
duty.

to human cloning. For purposes of this section, "cloning" means generating a genetically identical
copy of an organism at any stage of development by combining an enucleated egg and the nucleus
of a somatic cell to make an embryo.
    Subd. 2. Scientific research. Nothing in this section shall affect areas of scientific research
not specifically addressed by this section, including research in the use of nuclear transfer or other
cloning techniques to produce molecules, DNA, cells other than human embryos, tissues, organs,
plants, or animals other than humans. In addition, not withstanding section 145.422, nothing in this
section shall affect the scientific field of stem cell research, unless explicitly prohibited.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

   Sec. 15. STUDY OF GRADUATE EDUCATION IN FOR-PROFIT SECTOR.
    The Minnesota Office of Higher Education must study graduate education in for-profit
institutions with a physical presence in the state. The study must examine the rights and
responsibilities of graduate students attending those institutions. At a minimum, the study must
include an analysis of graduate student disciplinary processes; processes and policies adopted
for the protection of graduate students' intellectual property rights; policies and guidelines
addressing academic freedom of inquiry for students; and administrative processes in place to
address disputes. The office must report on the findings of this study by January 15, 2013, to the
committees of the legislature with responsibility for higher education finance. The report must
include recommendations for any changes to improve graduate education in the for-profit sector.
  Sec. 16. CREDIT TRANSFER WITHIN MINNESOTA STATE COLLEGES AND
UNIVERSITIES.
    When providing the report required by Laws 2010, chapter 364, section 38, the Board of
Trustees of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities shall provide information about progress
made toward achieving the goals described in the system's smart transfer plan, and shall provide
information about the number of students transferring between and among the system's two- and
four-year institutions during the previous fiscal year. In addition, the Board of Trustees shall
include a system study of mechanisms for effective transfer in other states.
