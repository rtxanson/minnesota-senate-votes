   Sec. 5. [473J.01] PURPOSE.
    The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the construction, financing, and long-term use of
a stadium and related stadium infrastructure as a venue for professional football and a broad range
of other civic, community, athletic, educational, cultural, and commercial activities. The legislature
finds and declares that the expenditure of public money for this purpose is necessary and serves
a public purpose, and that property acquired by the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority for the
construction of the stadium and related stadium infrastructure is acquired for a public use or public
purpose under chapter 117. The legislature further finds and declares that any provision in a lease
or use agreement with a professional football team that requires the team to play all of its home
games in a publicly funded stadium for the duration of the lease or use agreement, serves a unique
public purpose for which the remedies of specific performance and injunctive relief are essential to
its enforcement. The legislature further finds and declares that government assistance to facilitate
the presence of professional football provides to the state of Minnesota and its citizens highly valued
intangible benefits that are virtually impossible to quantify and, therefore, not recoverable even if
the government receives monetary damages in the event of a team's breach of contract. Minnesota
courts are, therefore, charged with protecting those benefits through the use of specific performance
and injunctive relief as provided in this chapter and in the lease and use agreements.

company or individual to manage the stadium and on certain major vendors to the stadium. The
authority, with the approval of the NFL team, may enter into an agreement with a program manager
for management of the stadium, for a maximum of 40 years.
   Subd. 2. Operating expenses. (a) The authority must pay or cause to be paid all operating
expenses of the stadium. The authority must require in the lease or use agreement with the NFL
team that the NFL team pay the authority, beginning January 1, 2016, or other date as mutually
agreed upon by the parties, toward operating costs of the stadium, $8,500,000 each year, increased
by a three percent annual inflation rate.
    (b) Beginning January 1, 2016, or other date as mutually agreed upon by the parties, and
continuing through 2020, the NFL team shall pay the authority operating expenses, $6,000,000
each year, increased by an annual adjustment factor. The payment of $6,000,000 per year beginning
in 2016 is a payment by the team, which shall be repaid to the team by the state, using funds as
provided under section 297A.994, subdivision 4, paragraph (a), clause (4). After 2020, the state
shall assume this payment, using funds generated in accordance with the city of Minneapolis as
specified under section 297A.994.

    (c) The authority may establish an operating reserve to cover operating expense shortfalls and
may accept funds from any source for deposit in the operating reserve. The establishment or funding
of an authority operating reserve must not decrease the amounts required to be paid to the authority
toward operating costs under this subdivision unless agreed to by the authority.
   (d) The authority will be responsible for operating cost overruns.
    (e) After the joint selection of the third-party manager or program manager, the authority
may agree with a program manager or other third-party manager of the stadium on a fixed cost
operating, management, or employment agreement with operating cost protections under which
the program manager or third-party manager assumes responsibility for stadium operating costs
and shortfalls. The agreement with the manager must require the manager to prepare an initial and
ongoing operating plan and operating budgets for approval by the authority in consultation with
the NFL team. The manager must agree to operate the stadium in accordance with the approved
operating plan and operating budget.
   Subd. 3. Public access. The authority will work to maximize access for public and amateur
sports, community, and civic events, and other public events in type and on terms consistent with
those currently held at the existing football stadium, as defined in section 473.551, subdivision 9.
The authority may provide that these events have exclusive use of the premises at agreed-upon times
subject to the scheduling rights of the NFL team under the lease or use agreement.
    Subd. 4. Capital improvements. (a) The authority shall establish a capital reserve fund.
The authority shall be responsible for making, or for causing others to make, all capital repairs,
replacements, and improvements for the stadium and stadium infrastructure. The authority shall
maintain, or cause others to maintain, the stadium and stadium infrastructure in a safe, clean,
attractive, and first-class manner so as to cause them to remain in a condition comparable to that
of other comparable NFL facilities of similar design and age. The authority shall make, or cause
others to make, all necessary or appropriate repairs, renewals, and replacements, whether structural
or nonstructural, interior or exterior, ordinary or extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen, in a prompt
and timely manner. In addition, the authority, with approval of the NFL team, may enter into an
agreement with a program manager to perform some or all of the responsibilities of the authority
in this subdivision and to assume and accept financial liability for the cost of performing the
responsibilities.
    (b) The NFL team must contribute $1,500,000 each year, beginning in 2016 or as otherwise
determined for the term of the lease or use agreement to the operating reserve fund, increased by a
three percent annual inflation rate.
    (c) The state shall contribute $1,500,000 each year, beginning in 2016 or as otherwise determined
for the term of the lease to the operating reserve fund. The contributions of the state are subject to
increase by an annual adjustment factor. The contribution under this paragraph shall be assumed by
the team from 2016 through 2020, and repaid to the team by the state using funds in accordance
with section 297A.994, subdivision 4, paragraph (a), clause (4).
    (d) The authority, with input from the NFL team, shall develop short-term and long-term capital
funding plans and shall use those plans to guide the future capital needs of the stadium and stadium
infrastructure. The authority shall make the final determination with respect to funding capital
needs. Any capital improvement proposed by the NFL team intended primarily to provide revenue
enhancements to the NFL team shall be paid for by the NFL team, unless otherwise agreed to with
108TH DAY]                         TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 2012                                      6217

the authority.
    Subd. 5. Game-day payments. In addition to operating expense contributions of the NFL
team under subdivision 2, the NFL team shall pay all NFL game day, NFL team-owned major
league soccer, as provided in section 473J.15, subdivision 15, and other NFL team-sponsored event
expenses within the stadium and stadium plaza areas.
    Subd. 6. Cooperation with financing. The authority will cooperate with the NFL team to
facilitate the financing of the NFL team's contribution. Such agreement to cooperate shall not
require the authority to incur any additional costs or provide conduit financing. The lease, license,
and other transaction documents shall include provisions customarily required by lenders in
stadium financings.
   Sec. 15. [473J.15] CRITERIA AND CONDITIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Binding and enforceable. In developing the stadium and entering into related
contracts, the authority must follow and enforce the criteria and conditions in this section, provided
that a determination by the authority that those criteria or conditions have been met under any
agreement or otherwise shall be conclusive.
    Subd. 2. NFL team/private contribution; timing of expenditures. (a) The NFL team/private
contribution, including stadium builder license proceeds, for stadium costs must be made in cash in
the amount of at least $427,000,000.
    (b) Prior to the initial deposit of funds under this section, the team must provide security or
other credit worthiness in the amount of $50,000,000, subject to the satisfaction of the authority.
Prior to the first issuance of bonds under section 16A.965, the first portion of the NFL team/private
contribution in the amount of $50,000,000 must be deposited as costs are incurred to the construction
fund to pay for the initial stadium costs.
    (c) After the first $50,000,000 of stadium costs have been paid from the initial NFL team/private
contribution, state funds shall be deposited as costs are incurred to the construction fund to pay
for the next $50,000,000 of costs of the project. Prior to any state funds being deposited in the
construction fund, the NFL team must provide security or a financing commitment reasonably
satisfactory to the authority for the balance of the required NFL team/private contribution and for
payment of cost overruns if the NFL team assumes responsibility for stadium construction under
section 473J.11. Thereafter, budgeted project costs shall be borne by the authority and the NFL
team/private contributions in amounts proportionate to their remaining funding commitments.
   (d) In the event the project terminates before the initial $100,000,000 in contributions are
expended by the parties under this subdivision, the parties shall be reimbursed in the amounts
they have deposited to the construction fund proportionate to project funding percentages, in the
amounts of 56 percent by the authority and 44 percent by the NFL team/private contributions.
    Subd. 3. Lease or use agreements; 40-year term. The authority must enter into a long-term
lease or use agreement with the NFL team for the NFL team's use of the stadium. The NFL team must
agree to play all preseason, regular season, and postseason home games at the stadium. Training
facilities must remain in Minnesota during the term of the lease or use agreement. The lease or
use agreement must be for a term of at least 40 years from the date of substantial completion of
the stadium for professional football games. The lease or use agreement may provide options for
6218                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [108TH DAY

the NFL team to extend the term for up to four additional periods of five years. The lease or use
agreement must include terms for default, termination, and breach of the agreement. Recognizing
that the presence of professional football provides to the state of Minnesota and its citizens highly
valued, intangible benefits that are virtually impossible to quantify and, therefore, not recoverable
in the event of the NFL team owner's breach of contract, the lease and use agreements must provide
for specific performance and injunctive relief to enforce provisions relating to use of the stadium for
professional football and must not include escape clauses or buyout provisions. The NFL team must
not enter into or accept any agreement or requirement with or from any entity that is inconsistent
with the NFL team's binding commitment to the 40-year term of the lease or use agreement or that
would in any manner dilute, interfere with, or negate the provisions of the lease or use agreement,
providing for specific performance or injunctive relief. The legislature conclusively determines, as a
matter of public policy, that the lease or use agreement, and any grant agreement under this chapter
that includes a specific performance clause:
   (1) explicitly authorizes specific performance as a remedy for breach;
   (2) is made for adequate consideration and upon terms which are otherwise fair and reasonable;
   (3) has not been included through sharp practice, misrepresentation, or mistake;
    (4) if specifically enforced, does not cause unreasonable or disproportionate hardship or loss to
the NFL team or to third parties; and
    (5) involves performance in a manner and the rendering of services of a nature and under
circumstances that the beneficiary cannot be adequately compensated in damages.
    Subd. 4. Lease or use agreements; revenues, payments. A lease or use agreement shall include
rent and other fees and expenses to be paid by the NFL team. The authority shall agree to provide
in the lease or use agreement for the NFL team to receive all NFL and team event related revenues,
including, but not limited to, suite revenues, advertising, concessions, signage, broadcast and media,
and club seat revenue. The agreement shall also provide that all naming rights to the stadium are
retained by the NFL team, subject to the approval of the name or names by the authority consistent
with those criteria set out in the lease or use agreement. The agreement shall provide for the authority
to receive all general ticket revenues and other event revenues other than from NFL team games,
NFL team-owned major league soccer games, and other NFL team events agreed to by the authority.
    Subd. 5. Notice of breach or default. Until 40 years from the date of stadium completion, the
NFL team must provide written notice to the authority not less than 180 days prior to any action,
including any action imposed upon the NFL team by the NFL, which would result in a breach or
default of provisions of the lease or use agreements required to be included under subdivision 3. If
this notice provision is violated and the NFL team has already breached or been in default under the
required provisions, the authority or the state of Minnesota may specifically enforce the lease or use
agreement and Minnesota courts shall fashion equitable remedies so that the NFL team fulfills the
conditions of the lease and use agreements.
   Subd. 6. Enforceable financial commitments. The authority must determine before stadium
construction begins that all public and private funding sources for construction, operating expenses,
and capital improvements and repairs of the stadium are included in written agreements. The
committed funds must be adequate to design, construct, furnish, and equip the stadium, and pay
projected operating expenses and the costs of capital improvements and repairs during the term

of the lease or use agreement with the NFL team. The NFL team must provide the authority
access to NFL team financial or other information, which the authority deems necessary for
such determination. Any financial information obtained by the authority under this subdivision is
nonpublic data under section 13.02, subdivision 9.
   Subd. 7. Environmental requirements. The authority must comply with all environmental
requirements imposed by regulatory agencies for the stadium, site, and structure, except as provided
by section 473J.09, subdivision 11, or by section 473J.17.
    Subd. 8. Public share on sale of NFL team. The lease or use agreement must provide that,
if the NFL team is sold or an interest in the NFL team is sold after the effective date of this
chapter, a portion of the sale price must be paid to the authority and deposited in a reserve fund
for improvements to the stadium or expended as the authority may otherwise direct. The portion
required to be so paid to the authority is 18 percent of the amount in excess of the purchase price
of the NFL team by the selling owner or owners, declining to zero 15 years after commencement
of stadium construction in increments of 1.2 percent each year. The agreement must provide
exceptions for sales to members of the owners' family and entities and trusts beneficially owned by
family members, sales to employees of equity interests aggregating up to ten percent, sales related
to capital infusions not distributed to the owners, and sales amongst existing owners not exceeding
20 percent equity interest in the NFL team.
    Subd. 9. Authority's access to NFL team financial information. A notice provision for a
material breach shall be agreed to between the authority and the NFL team. In the event there is a
material breach by the NFL team under the lease or use agreement, the lease or use agreement must
provide the authority access to audited financial statements of the NFL team and other financial
information that the authority deems necessary to enforce the terms of any lease or use agreements.
Any financial information obtained by the authority under this subdivision is nonpublic data under
section 13.02, subdivision 9.
    Subd. 10. NFL team name retained. The lease or use agreement must provide that the NFL
team and NFL will transfer to the state of Minnesota the Minnesota Vikings' heritage and records,
including the name, logo, colors, history, playing records, trophies, and memorabilia in the event of
relocation of the NFL team in violation of the lease or use agreement.
    Subd. 11. Stadium design. (a) The authority and the NFL team will build a stadium that
is environmentally and energy efficient and will make an effort to build a stadium that is
eligible to receive the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification
for environmental design, and to the extent practicable, will strive to make the stadium design
architecturally significant.
    (b) The stadium design must, to the extent feasible, follow sustainable building guidelines
established under section 16B.325.
    (c) The authority and the team must ensure that the stadium be constructed with steel made in
the USA.
    Subd. 12. Necessary approvals. The authority and the NFL team must secure any necessary
approvals to the terms of the lease and use agreement and the design and construction plans for the
stadium, including prior approval of the NFL.
6220                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [108TH DAY

   Subd. 13. Affordable access. The lease or use agreement must provide for an agreed-upon
number of affordable tickets to the professional sporting events held in the stadium.
    Subd. 14. Stadium builder's licenses. The authority shall own and retain the exclusive right to
sell stadium builder's licenses in the stadium. The authority will retain the NFL team to act as the
authority's agent in marketing and selling such licenses.
    Subd. 15. Major league soccer. The authority shall, for five years after the first NFL team home
game is played in the stadium, grant the NFL team the exclusive right to establish major league
soccer at the stadium. The authority and the NFL team may enter into an agreement providing the
terms and conditions of such an arrangement, provided:
    (1) if any of the NFL team owners whose family owns at least three percent of the NFL team
purchases full or partial ownership in a major league soccer franchise, such franchise may play
in the stadium under a use agreement with similar terms as are applicable to the NFL team at no
additional rent, but including a provision of payment of game-day costs and reasonable marginal
costs incurred by the authority as a result of the major league soccer team; and
  (2) capital improvements required by a major league soccer franchise must be financed by the
owners of the major league soccer team, unless otherwise agreed to by the authority.
    Subd. 16. NFL team-related entities. Subject to the prior approval of the authority, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, any of the obligations by the NFL team may be performed by the NFL
team, a related entity, or a third party, and the NFL team, any entity related to the NFL team or third
party may receive any revenues to which the NFL team is entitled hereunder; provided, however,
the NFL team shall remain liable if any obligations are assigned to a related entity or third party.
   Sec. 16. [473J.17] MUNICIPAL ACTIVITIES.
    Subdivision 1. Property acquisition and disposition. The city may, to the extent legally
permissible, acquire land, air rights, and other property interests within the development area
for the stadium site and stadium infrastructure and convey it to the authority with or without
consideration, prepare a site for development as a stadium, and acquire and construct any related
stadium infrastructure. To the extent property parcels or interests acquired are more extensive than
the stadium infrastructure requirements, the city may sell or otherwise dispose of the excess.
    Subd. 2. Claims. Except as may be mutually agreed to by the city and the authority, the city has
no interest in or claim to any assets or revenues of the authority.
    Subd. 3. Environmental; planning and zoning. The authority is the responsible governmental
unit for an environmental impact statement for the stadium prepared under section 116D.04, if an
environmental impact statement is necessary. Notwithstanding section 116D.04, subdivision 2b,
and implementing rules: (1) the environmental impact statement shall not be required to consider
alternative stadium sites; and (2) the environmental impact statement must be determined to be
adequate before commencing work on the foundation of the stadium, but the stadium and stadium
infrastructure may otherwise be started and all preliminary and final government decisions and
actions may be made and taken including, but not limited to, acquiring land; obtaining financing;
granting permits or other land use approvals; entering into grant, lease, or use agreements; or
preparing the site or related stadium infrastructure prior to a determination of the adequacy of the
environmental impact statement.
108TH DAY]                          TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 2012                                       6221

    Subd. 4. Local government expenditure. The city may make expenditures or grants for other
costs incidental and necessary to further the purposes of this chapter and may, by agreement,
reimburse in whole or in part, any entity that has granted, loaned, or advanced funds to the city to
further the purposes of this chapter. The city may reimburse the authority or a local governmental
entity or make a grant to the authority or such a governmental unit or be reimbursed by the authority
or local governmental entity for site acquisition, preparation of the site for stadium development,
and stadium infrastructure.
    Subd. 5. Municipal authority. The legislature intends that, except as expressly limited herein,
the city may acquire and develop stadium infrastructure, enter into contracts with the authority
and other governmental or nongovernmental entities, appropriate funds, and make employees,
consultants, and other revenues available for those purposes.
     Subd. 6. Stadium Implementation Committee; city review. In order to accomplish the
objectives of this act within the required time frame, it is necessary to establish an alternative
process for municipal land use and development review. It is hereby found and declared that
the construction of a stadium within the development area is consistent with the adopted area
plan, is the preferred stadium location, and is a permitted land use. This subdivision establishes a
procedure for all land use and development reviews and approvals by the city of Minneapolis for
the stadium and related stadium infrastructure and supersedes all land use and development rules
and restrictions and procedures imposed by other law, charter, or ordinance, including without
limitation section 15.99. No later than 30 days after timely compliance of the city as provided in
article 4, section 5, of this act, the city of Minneapolis shall establish a stadium implementation
committee to make recommendations on the design plans submitted for the stadium, and stadium
infrastructure, and related improvements. The implementation committee must take action to issue
its recommendations within the time frames established in the planning and construction timetable
issued by the authority which shall provide for no less than 60 days for the committee's review. The
recommendations of the implementation committee shall be forwarded to the city of Minneapolis
Planning Commission for an advisory recommendation and then to the city council for final action
in a single resolution, which final action must be taken within 45 days of the submission of the
recommendations to the planning commission. The city council shall not impose any unreasonable
conditions on the recommendations of the implementation committee, nor take any action or
impose any conditions that will result in delay from the time frames established in the planning
and construction timetable or in additional overall costs. Failure of the city council to act within
the 45-day period shall be deemed to be approval. The authority may seek de novo review in the
district court of any city council action. The district court or any appellate court shall expedite
review to the maximum extent possible and timely issue relief, orders, or opinions as necessary to
give effect to the provisions and objectives in this act.
   Sec. 17. [473J.23] LOCAL TAXES.
    No new or additional local sales or use tax shall be imposed on sales at the stadium site unless the
tax is applicable throughout the taxing jurisdiction. No new or additional local tax shall be imposed
on sales of tickets and admissions to NFL team, NFL team-owned major league soccer, or other
team related events at the stadium, notwithstanding any law or ordinance, unless the tax is applicable
throughout the taxing jurisdiction. The admissions and amusements tax currently imposed by the
city of Minneapolis pursuant to Laws 1969, chapter 1092, may apply to admissions for football and
NFL team related events, including NFL team-owned major league soccer, as provided in section
6222                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [108TH DAY

    Subd. 3. Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission abolished; interim powers conferred
on authority. Upon transfer to the authority of all remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations of
the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, in subdivision 2, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities
Commission is abolished. When the remaining assets, liabilities, and obligations of the Metropolitan
Sports Facilities Commission have been transferred to the authority and the commission has been
abolished, the powers and duties of the commission under sections 473.551 to 473.599, and any
other law shall devolve upon the authority, in addition to the powers and duties of the authority
under this chapter, until the first NFL home game is played at the stadium.
    Subd. 4. Employees. Upon transfer of ownership all persons employed by the Metropolitan
Sports Facilities Commission shall be transferred to the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority
without loss of right or privilege. Nothing in this section shall be construed to give any such person
the right or privilege to continue in the same level or classification of employment previously held.
The Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority may assign any such person to an employment level and
classification which it deems appropriate and desirable in accordance with its personnel code.

income of the owners for federal income tax purposes.
    (d) At the time of, or in anticipation of, issuing the appropriation bonds, and at any time

  Section 1. [297A.994] CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS SALES TAX; ALLOCATION OF
REVENUES.
   Subdivision 1. Scope. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 297A.99, subdivision 11, the
provisions of this section govern the remittance of the proceeds of taxes imposed by the city of
Minneapolis under the special law.
   Subd. 2. Definitions. (a) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply.
   (b) "City" means the city of Minneapolis.
   (c) "Special law" means Laws 1986, chapter 396, sections 4 and 5, as amended.
   (d) "Tax" means the sales taxes imposed by the city under the special law.
   (e) The terms defined under section 473J.03 apply for purposes of this section.
    Subd. 3. General allocation of revenues. The commissioner shall apply the revenues from the
taxes as follows:
    (1) the commissioner must deduct the costs of collecting and administering the taxes, according
to the applicable law and agreements between the commissioner and the city. For revenues from the
general sales tax, the commissioner must deduct a proportionate share of the cost of collection, as
described in section 297A.99, subdivision 11;
    (2) after deducting the costs in clause (1), the commissioner must deduct refunds of any of these
taxes due to taxpayers, if any;
    (3) after making the deductions provided in clause (2), notwithstanding the provisions of any
agreement between the commissioner and the city providing for collection and remittance of these
taxes, the commissioner must deposit to the general fund the amounts specified in subdivision 4;

or rates, and schedules of annual amounts. The present value date or dates must be based on the
date or dates bonds are sold under section 16A.965, or the date or dates other state funds, if any, are
deposited into the construction fund. The discount rate or rates must be based on the true interest
cost of the bonds issued under section 16A.965, or an equivalent 30-year bond index, as determined
by the commissioner of management and budget. The schedule of annual amounts must be certified
to the commissioner by the commissioner of management and budget and the finance officer of the
city;
    (2) for the capital improvement reserve appropriation to the sports facilities authority beginning
in calendar year 2021, and for each calendar year thereafter through calendar year 2046, so that not
later than January 1, 2022, and as of January 1 of each following year, an aggregate annual amount
equal to the amount paid by the state for calendar year 2021, under section 473J.13, subdivision 4,
increased each year by an annual adjustment factor;
    (3) for the operating expense appropriation to the sports facilities authority beginning in calendar
year 2021, and for each calendar year thereafter through calendar year 2046, so that not later than

    (4) for recapture of NFL team advances for capital improvements and operating expenses for
calendar years 2016 through 2020 beginning in calendar year 2021, and for each calendar year
thereafter until all amounts under this clause have been paid, proportionate amounts periodically
until an aggregate amount equal to the present value of all amounts paid by the NFL team have
been deposited in the general fund. To determine the present value of the amounts paid by the NFL
team to the authority and the present value of amounts deposited to the general fund under this
clause, the commissioner shall consult with the commissioner of management and budget and the
NFL team regarding the present value dates, discount rate or rates, and schedule of annual amounts.
The present value dates must be based on the dates NFL team funds are paid to the authority, or the
dates the commissioner of revenue deposits taxes for purposes of this clause to the general fund. The
discount rates must be based on the reasonably equivalent cost of NFL team funds as determined
by the commissioner of management and budget after consulting with the NFL team. The schedule
of annual amounts must be revised to reflect amounts paid under section 473J.09, subdivision 13,
and taxes deposited to the general fund from time to time under this clause, and the schedule and
revised schedules must be certified to the commissioner by the commissioner of management and
budget and the finance officer of the city, and are transferred as accrued from the general fund to the
NFL team, for repayment of advances made by the NFL team to the city of Minneapolis; and
    (5) to capture increases in taxes imposed under the special law, for the benefit of the sports
facilities authority, beginning in calendar year 2013 and for each calendar year thereafter through
2046, there shall be deposited to the general fund by February 15 of each following year, amounts
calculated by the commissioner under this clause. For each year, the commissioner shall determine
the excess, if any, of the taxes received by the commissioner over the benchmark scheduled amounts
of the taxes, as described in this section. The benchmark scheduled amounts for each year must
be based on the actual amount of the taxes for calendar year 2011 inflated for each subsequent
year at an annual rate of two percent, according to a schedule certified to the commissioner by the
commissioner of management and budget and the finance officer of the city. The amounts to be
deposited to the general fund by the commissioner for each year equal:

    (i) zero for the amount of the taxes for the year up to a scheduled benchmark of $1,000,000,
inflated at two percent per year, in excess of the taxes for calendar year 2011;
    (ii) 50 percent times the difference, if any, by which the amount of the taxes for the year exceeds
the scheduled benchmark in item (i), as inflated, but not greater than a scheduled benchmark of
$3,000,000, inflated at two percent per year, in excess of the taxes for calendar year 2011; and
    (iii) 25 percent times the difference, if any, by which the amount of the taxes for the year exceeds
the scheduled benchmark of $3,000,000, inflated at two percent per year, in excess of the taxes for
calendar year 2011.
   (b) The annual adjustment factor for purposes of this section and the special law for any year
equals the increase, if any, in the amount of these taxes received by the commissioner in the
preceding year over the amount received in the year prior to the preceding year, expressed as
a percentage of the amount received in the year prior to the preceding year; provided, that the
adjustment factor for any year must not be less than zero percent nor more than five percent.

    (i) No distributor or distributor salesperson may sell gambling equipment, except gambling

tipboard deal with the symbol required by section 349.163, subdivision 5, paragraph (d), visible on
the flare to any person other than in Minnesota to a licensed organization or organization exempt
from licensing.
   Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.162, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Sales from facilities. (a) All gambling equipment purchased or possessed by a licensed
distributor for resale or lease to any person for use in Minnesota must, prior to the equipment's
resale or lease, be unloaded into a storage facility located in Minnesota which the distributor owns
or leases; and which has been registered, in advance and in writing, with the Division of Alcohol and
Gambling Enforcement as a storage facility of the distributor. All unregistered gambling equipment
and all unaffixed registration stamps owned by, or in the possession of, a licensed distributor in the
state of Minnesota shall be stored at a storage facility which has been registered with the Division of
Alcohol and Gambling Enforcement. No gambling equipment may be moved from the facility unless
the gambling equipment has been first registered with the board or the Department of Revenue. A
distributor must notify the board of the method that it will use to sell and transfer electronic pull-tab
games to licensed organizations, and must receive approval of the board before implementing or
making changes to the approved method.
    (b) Notwithstanding section 349.163, subdivisions 5, 6, and 8, a licensed manufacturer may
ship into Minnesota approved or unapproved gambling equipment if the licensed manufacturer
ships the gambling equipment to a Minnesota storage facility that is: (1) owned or leased by the
licensed manufacturer; and (2) registered, in advance and in writing, with the Division of Alcohol
and Gambling Enforcement as a manufacturer's storage facility. No gambling equipment may be
shipped into Minnesota to the manufacturer's registered storage facility unless the shipment of
the gambling equipment is reported to the Department of Revenue in a manner prescribed by the
6248                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [108TH DAY

department. No gambling equipment may be moved from the storage facility unless the gambling
equipment is sold to a licensed distributor and is otherwise in conformity with this chapter, is
shipped to an out-of-state site and the shipment is reported to the Department of Revenue in a
manner prescribed by the department, or is otherwise sold and shipped as permitted by board
rule. A manufacturer must notify the board of the method that it will use to sell and transfer
electronic pull-tab games to licensed distributors, and must receive approval of the board before
implementing or making changes to the approved method.
    (c) All storage facilities owned, leased, used, or operated by a licensed distributor or
manufacturer may be entered upon and inspected by the employees of the Division of Alcohol and
Gambling Enforcement, the Division of Alcohol and Gambling Enforcement director's authorized
representatives, employees of the Gambling Control Board or its authorized representatives,
employees of the Department of Revenue, or authorized representatives of the director of the
Division of Special Taxes of the Department of Revenue during reasonable and regular business
hours. Obstruction of, or failure to permit, entry and inspection is cause for revocation or suspension
of a manufacturer's or distributor's licenses and permits issued under this chapter.
    (d) Unregistered gambling equipment found at any location in Minnesota other than the
manufacturing plant of a licensed manufacturer or a registered storage facility are contraband under
section 349.2125. This paragraph does not apply:
    (1) to unregistered gambling equipment being transported in interstate commerce between
locations outside this state, if the interstate shipment is verified by a bill of lading or other valid
shipping document; and
    (2) to gambling equipment registered with the Department of Revenue for distribution to the
tribal casinos.
   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.163, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. License required. No manufacturer of gambling equipment may sell any
gambling equipment to any person for use or resale within the state, unless the manufacturer has
a current and valid license issued by the board under this section and has satisfied other criteria
prescribed by the board by rule. A manufacturer licensed under this section may also be licensed
as a linked bingo game provider under section 349.1635.
    A manufacturer licensed under this section may not also be directly or indirectly licensed as a
distributor under section 349.161.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.163, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Paper pull-tab and tipboard flares. (a) A manufacturer may not ship or cause to be
shipped into this state or sell for use or resale in this state any deal of paper pull-tabs or tipboards
that does not have its own individual flare as required for that deal by this subdivision and rule of the
board. A person other than a manufacturer may not manufacture, alter, modify, or otherwise change
a flare for a deal of paper pull-tabs or tipboards except as allowed by this chapter or board rules.
    (b) The flare of each paper pull-tab and tipboard game must have affixed to or imprinted at the
bottom a bar code that provides all information required by the commissioner of revenue under
section 297E.04, subdivision 2.
108TH DAY]                           TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 2012                                        6249

    The serial number included in the bar code must be the same as the serial number of the tickets
included in the deal. A manufacturer who manufactures a deal of paper pull-tabs must affix to the
outside of the box containing that game the same bar code that is affixed to or imprinted at the
bottom of a flare for that deal.
    (c) No person may alter the bar code that appears on the outside of a box containing a deal of
paper pull-tabs and tipboards. Possession of a box containing a deal of paper pull-tabs and tipboards
that has a bar code different from the bar code of the deal inside the box is prima facie evidence that
the possessor has altered the bar code on the box.
    (d) The flare of each deal of paper pull-tabs and tipboards sold by a manufacturer for use or resale
in Minnesota must have imprinted on it a symbol that is at least one inch high and one inch wide
consisting of an outline of the geographic boundaries of Minnesota with the letters "MN" inside the
outline. The flare must be placed inside the wrapping of the deal which the flare describes.
    (e) Each paper pull-tab and tipboard flare must bear the following statement printed in letters
large enough to be clearly legible:
   "Pull-tab (or tipboard) purchasers ญ This pull-tab (or tipboard) game is not legal in Minnesota
unless:
   ญ an outline of Minnesota with letters "MN" inside it is imprinted on this sheet, and
   ญ the serial number imprinted on the bar code at the bottom of this sheet is the same as the serial
number on the pull-tab (or tipboard) ticket you have purchased."
   (f) The flare of each paper pull-tab and tipboard game must have the serial number of the game
imprinted on the bar code at the bottom of the flare in numerals at least one-half inch high.
   Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.163, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Samples of gambling equipment. (a) The board shall require each licensed
manufacturer to submit to the board one or more samples of each item of gambling equipment

subdivision, a manufacturer is also required to submit the applicable version of any software
necessary to operate electronic devices and related systems.
    (b) The board shall inspect and test all the equipment, including software and software upgrades,
it deems necessary to determine the equipment's compliance with law and board rules. Samples
required under this subdivision must be approved by the board before the equipment being sampled
is shipped into or sold for use or resale in this state. The board shall impose a fee of $25 for each item
of gambling equipment that the manufacturer submits for approval or for which the manufacturer
requests approval. The board shall impose a fee of $100 for each sample of gambling equipment
that it tests.
    (c) The board may require samples of gambling equipment to be tested by an independent testing
laboratory prior to submission to the board for approval. All costs of testing by an independent
testing laboratory must be borne by the manufacturer. An independent testing laboratory used by
a manufacturer to test samples of gambling equipment must be approved by the board before the
equipment is submitted to the laboratory for testing.

    (d) The board may request the assistance of the commissioner of public safety and the director
of the State Lottery in performing the tests.
   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.1635, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. License application. The board may issue a license to a linked bingo game provider or
to a manufacturer licensed under section 349.163 who meets the qualifications of this chapter and
the rules promulgated by the board. The application shall be on a form prescribed by the board. The
license is valid for two years and the fee for a linked bingo game provider license is $5,000 per year.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.1635, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
  Subd. 3. Attachments to application. An applicant for a linked bingo game provider license
must attach to its application:
    (1) evidence of a bond in the principal amount of $100,000 payable to the state of Minnesota
conditioned on the payment of all linked bingo prizes and any other money due and payable under
this chapter;
    (2) detailed plans and specifications for the operation of the linked bingo game and the linked
bingo system, along with a proposed fee schedule for the cost of providing services and equipment to
licensed organizations which may not exceed 15 percent of gross profits, unless a higher percentage,
not to exceed 20 percent, is authorized by the board. The fee schedule must incorporate costs paid
to distributors for services provided under subdivision 5; and
   (3) any other information required by the board by rule.
   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.1635, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Linked bingo game services requirements. (a) A linked bingo game provider must
contract with licensed distributors for linked bingo game services including, but not limited to, the
solicitation of agreements with licensed organizations, and installation, repair, or maintenance of
the linked bingo game system.
   (b) A distributor may not charge a fee to licensed organizations for services authorized and
rendered under paragraph (a).
   (c) A linked bingo game provider may not contract with any distributor on an exclusive basis.
    (d) A linked bingo game provider may refuse to contract with a licensed distributor if the linked
bingo game provider demonstrates that the licensed distributor is not capable of performing the
services under the contract.
   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.165, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Contents of application. An application for a premises permit must contain:

     Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 349.19, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Pull-tab records. (a) The board shall by rule require a licensed organization to require
each winner of a paper pull-tab prize of $50 or more to present identification in the form of a driver's
license, Minnesota identification card, or other identification the board deems sufficient to allow the
identification and tracking of the winner. The rule must require the organization to retain winning
paper pull-tabs of $50 or more, and the identification of the winner of the pull-tab, for 3-1/2 years.
    (b) An organization must maintain separate cash banks for each deal of paper pull-tabs unless
(1) the licensed organization uses a pull-tab dispensing device, or (2) the organization uses a cash
register, of a type approved by the board, which records all sales of paper pull-tabs by separate deals.
     (c) The board shall:
    (1) by rule adopt minimum technical standards for cash registers that may be used by
organizations, and shall approve for use by organizations any cash register that meets the standards;
and

    (2) before allowing an organization to use a cash register that commingles receipts from several
different paper pull-tab games in play, adopt rules that define how cash registers may be used and
that establish a procedure for organizations to reconcile all pull-tab games in play at the end of each
month.

determines that 40 percent of the revenues derived from the tax together with other revenues pledged
to the payment of the bonds, including the proceeds of definitive bonds, is expected to exceed the
annual debt service on the bonds.
    (d) If in any year more than 40 percent of the revenue derived from the tax authorized by
subdivision 1 is used to pay debt service on the bonds issued for the purposes of paragraph (a) and to
fund a reserve for the bonds, the amount of the debt service payment that exceeds 40 percent of the
revenue must be determined for that year. In any year when 40 percent of the revenue produced by
the sales tax exceeds the amount required to pay debt service on the bonds and to fund a reserve for
the bonds under paragraph (a), the amount of the excess must be made available for capital projects
to further residential, cultural, commercial, and economic development in the neighborhoods and
downtown until the cumulative amounts determined for all years under the preceding sentence
have been made available under this sentence. The amount made available as reimbursement in
the preceding sentence is not included in the 60 percent determined under paragraph (c).

percent of the revenue from the tax in any year, the city may place the difference between 40 percent
of the revenue and the amounts allocated under paragraphs (a) and (d) in an economic development

(b) The commissioner must deposit the
repayments in the state treasury and credit
them to the general fund.
(c) The loan may not be made until the
commissioner has entered into an agreement
with the city of St. Paul identifying the rental
or other payments that will be made and
establishing the dates on and the amounts
in which the payments will be made to the
city and by the city to the commissioner. The
payments may include operating revenues
and additional payments to be made by the
lessee under agreements to be negotiated
between the commissioner, the city, and the
lessee. Those agreements may include, but
are not limited to, an agreement whereby the
lessee pledges to provide each year a letter
of credit sufficient to guarantee the payment
of the amount due for the next succeeding
year; an agreement whereby the lessee agrees
to maintain a net worth, certified each year
by a financial institution or accounting
firm satisfactory to the commissioner, that
is greater than the balance due under the
payment schedule in paragraph (a); and any
other agreements the commissioner may
deem necessary to ensure that the payments
are made as scheduled.
(d) The agreements must provide that the
failure of the lessee to make a payment due
to the city under the agreement is an event
of default under the lease between the city
and the lessee and that the state is entitled to
enforce the remedies of the lessor under the
lease in the event of default. Those remedies
must include, but need not be limited to, the
6268                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [108TH DAY

obligation of the lessee to pay the balance due
for the remainder of the payment schedule
in the event the lessee ceases to operate a
National Hockey League team in the arena.
(e) By January 1, 1999, the commissioner
shall report to the chair of the senate
committee on state government finance
and the chair of the house committee on
ways and means the terms of an agreement
between the lessee and the amateur sports
commission whereby the lessee agrees to
make the facilities of the arena available
to the commission on terms satisfactory to
the commission for amateur sports activities
consistent with the purposes of Minnesota
Statutes, chapter 240A, each year during the
time the loan is outstanding. The amateur
sports commission must negotiate in good
faith and may be required to pay no more
than actual out-of-pocket expenses for the
time it uses the arena. The agreement may not
become effective before February 1, 1999.
During any calendar year after 1999 that an
agreement under this paragraph is not in effect
and a payment is due under the schedule, the
lessee must pay to the commissioner a penalty
of $750,000 for that year. If the amateur
sports commission has not negotiated in good
faith, no penalty is due.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 18B.065, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Disposal site requirement. (a) For agricultural waste pesticides, the commissioner
must designate a place in each county of the state that is available at least every other year for
persons to dispose of unused portions of agricultural pesticides. The commissioner shall consult
with the person responsible for solid waste management and disposal in each county to determine
an appropriate location and to advertise each collection event. The commissioner may provide a
collection opportunity in a county more frequently if the commissioner determines that a collection
is warranted.
   (b) For nonagricultural waste pesticides, the commissioner must provide a disposal opportunity
each year in each county or enter into a contract with a group of counties under a joint powers

    Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 21.82, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Vegetable seeds. For vegetable seeds prepared for use in home gardens or household
plantings the requirements in paragraphs (a) to (p) apply. Vegetable seeds packed for sale in
commercial quantities to farmers, conservation groups, and other similar entities are considered
agricultural seeds and must be labeled accordingly.
    (a) The label must contain the name of the kind or kind and variety for each seed component in
excess of five percent of the whole and the percentage by weight of each in order of its predominance.
If the variety of those kinds generally labeled as to variety is not stated and it is not required to be
stated, the label must show the name of the kind and the words "variety not stated."
   (b) The percentage that is hybrid must be at least 95 percent of the percentage of pure seed
shown unless the percentage of pure seed which is hybrid seed is shown separately. If two or more
kinds of varieties are present in excess of five percent and are named on the label, each that is hybrid
must be designated as hybrid on the label. Any one kind or kind and variety that has pure seed that

pollination in a cross must be labeled to show the percentage of pure seed that is hybrid seed or a
statement such as "contains from 75 percent to 95 percent hybrid seed." No one kind or variety of
seed may be labeled as hybrid if the pure seed contains less than 75 percent hybrid seed. The word
"hybrid" must be shown on the label in conjunction with the kind.
    (c) Blends must be listed on the label using the term "blend" in conjunction with the kind.
    (d) Mixtures shall be listed on the label using the term "mixture," "mix," or "mixed."
    (e) The label must show a lot number or other lot identification.
    (f) The origin may be omitted from the label.
    (g) The label must show the year for which the seed was packed for sale listed as "packed for
(year)" for seed with a percentage of germination that exceeds the standard last established by the
commissioner, the percentage of germination and the calendar month and year that the percentages
were determined by test, or the calendar month and year the germination test was completed and
the statement "sell by (month and year listed here)," which may be no more than 12 months from
the date of test, exclusive of the month of test.
   (h) For vegetable seeds which germinate less than the standard last established by the
commissioner, the label must show:
    (1) a percentage of germination, exclusive of hard or dormant seed or both;
    (2) a percentage of hard or dormant seed or both, if present; and
   (3) the words "below standard" in not less than eight point type and the month and year the
percentages were determined by test.

infected premises designated by the board as quarantined under subdivision 2. The executive director
of the board or any licensed veterinarian designated by the board may issue the orders. An order may
be issued upon a determination that reasonable cause exists to believe that the movement of persons
or personal property out of a quarantine zone will reasonably threaten to transport a dangerous,
infectious, or communicable disease outside of the quarantine zone.
    (b) The order must be served upon any person subject to the order. The restrictions sought by
the board on movement out of a quarantine zone must be limited to the greatest extent possible
consistent with the paramount disease control objectives as determined by the board. An order under
this section may be served on any day at any time. The order must include a notice of the person's
rights under this section, including the ability to enter into an agreement to abide by disease control
measures under paragraph (c) and the right to request a court hearing under paragraph (d).
    (c) No person may be restricted by an order under this subdivision for longer than 72 hours,
exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, so long as the person agrees to abide by the
disease control measures established by the board. The person shall sign an acknowledgment form
prepared by the board evidencing the person's agreement to abide by the disease control measures
established by the board.
    (d) A person whose movements are restricted by an order under this subdivision may seek a
district court hearing on the order at any time after it is served on the person. The hearing may be
held by electronic means as soon as possible. The subject of the order may:
    (1) contest imposition of the order on grounds that it is an abuse of the board's discretion under
this section; or
   (2) seek a variance from it to allow movement of a person inconsistent with the order, upon a
showing that the person would otherwise suffer irreparable harm.

statement that is prepared by a grain commission firm or a management firm approved by the
commissioner or by an independent public accountant, in accordance with standards established by
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Grain buyers purchasing less than 150,000
bushels of grain per calendar year may submit a financial statement prepared by a public accountant
who is not an employee or a relative within the third degree of kindred according to civil law.

financial statement accurately reflects the financial condition of the licensee for the period specified
in the statement.
    (b) Only one financial statement must be filed for a chain of warehouses owned or operated as a
single business entity, unless otherwise required by the commissioner. Any grain buyer having a net
worth in excess of $500,000,000 need not file the financial statement required by this subdivision
but must provide the commissioner with a certified net worth statement. All financial statements
filed with the commissioner are private or nonpublic data as provided in section 13.02.

all lawful charges, the grain represented by the receipt is immediately deliverable to the depositor or
the depositor's order, and is not subject to any further charge for storage after demand for delivery
has been made and proper facilities for receiving and shipping the grain have been provided. If
delivery has not commenced within 48 hours after demand has been made and proper facilities have
been provided, the public grain warehouse operator issuing the grain warehouse receipt is liable to

or that it has not been inspected, in violation of sections 31A.01 to 31A.16, the Federal Meat
Inspection Act, or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or that the article or animal has
been or is intended to be distributed in violation of a provision of those laws, it may be detained
by the representative for up to 20 days pending action under section 3     ญญ

moved by a person, firm, or corporation from the place at which it is located when detained, until
released by the representative. The representative may require all official marks to be removed
from the article or animal before it is released unless the commissioner is satisfied that the article
or animal is eligible to retain the official marks.

represented to possess by its labeling; or
   (15) it is confectionery and:
    (i) has partially or completely imbedded in the food any nonnutritive object, provided that this
clause does not apply in the case of any nonnutritive object if in the judgment of the commissioner,
as provided by rules, the object is of practical functional value to the confectionery product and
would not render the product injurious or hazardous to human or animal health; or
    (ii) bears or contains any nonnutritive substance; provided that this item does not apply to a
confection containing alcohol as defined in section 31.76, or a safe nonnutritive substance which is
in or on confectionery by reason of its use for some practical functional purpose in the manufacture,
packaging, or storing of the confectionery if the use of the substance does not promote deception
of the consumer or otherwise result in adulteration or misbranding in violation of this chapter, and
provided further that the commissioner may, for the purpose of avoiding or resolving uncertainty as
to the application of this clause, issue rules allowing or prohibiting the use of particular nonnutritive
substances.
   Sec. 26. [34A.03] MISBRANDING.
   (a) Food is misbranded if:
     (1) its labeling is false or misleading in any particular, or its labeling, whether on the item itself,
its container, or its package, fails to conform with the requirements of this chapter;
   (2) it is offered for sale or distributed under the name of another food;
    (3) it is an imitation of another food for which a definition and standard of identity have been
prescribed by rules as provided by sections 31.10 and 31.102; or if it is an imitation of another food
that is not subject to clause (5), unless in either case its label bears in type of uniform size and
prominence the word "imitation" and immediately thereafter the name of the food imitated;
   (4) its container is so made, formed, or filled as to be misleading;
6322                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [108TH DAY

    (5) it purports to be or is represented as a food for which a definition and standard of identity
have been prescribed by rules as provided by sections 31.10, 31.102, and 31A.07, unless it conforms
to that definition and standard, and its label bears the name of the food specified in the definition and
standard, and insofar as may be required by the rules, the common names of optional ingredients,
other than spices, flavoring, and coloring, present in the food;
   (6) it purports to be or is represented as:
   (i) a food for which a standard of quality has been prescribed by rules as provided by sections
31.10 and 31.102, and its quality falls below that standard unless its label bears in a manner and
form the rules specify, a statement that it falls below the standard; or
    (ii) a food for which a standard or standards of fill of container have been prescribed by rule as
provided by sections 31.10, 31.102, and 31A.07, and it falls below the standard of fill of container
applicable thereto unless its label bears, in a manner and form the rules specify, a statement that it
falls below the standard;
    (7) it is not subject to clause (5), unless it bears labeling clearly giving the common or usual name
of the food, if there is one, and in case it is fabricated from two or more ingredients, the common or
usual name of each ingredient, except that spices, flavorings, and colorings, other than those sold as
such, may be designated as spices, flavorings, and colorings, without naming each, provided that to
the extent that compliance with the requirements of this clause is impractical or results in deception
or unfair competition, exemptions must be established by rules promulgated by the commissioner;
   (8) it purports to be or is represented for special dietary uses, unless its label bears information
concerning its vitamin, mineral, and other dietary properties as the commissioner determines to be,
and by rules prescribed as, necessary in order to fully inform purchasers as to its value for those
uses;
    (9) it bears or contains any artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservative,
unless it bears labeling stating that fact; provided that, to the extent that compliance with the
requirements of this clause is impracticable, exemptions must be established by rules promulgated
by the commissioner. The provisions of this clause and clauses (5) and (7) with respect to artificial
coloring do not apply to butter, cheese, or ice cream. The provisions with respect to chemical
preservatives do not apply to a pesticide when used in or on a raw agricultural commodity which
is the product of the soil;
    (10) it is a product intended as an ingredient of another food and when used according to the
directions of the purveyor will result in the final food product being adulterated or misbranded;
   (11) it is a color additive unless its packaging and labeling are in conformity with such packaging
and labeling requirements applicable to the color additive prescribed under the provisions of the
federal act;
    (12) it is food subject to section 31.101, subdivision 10, or chapter 31A, that fails to bear,
directly or on its container, as the commissioner by rule prescribes, the inspection legend and other
information the commissioner may require by rule to ensure that it will not have false or misleading
labeling, and that the public will be told how to keep the article wholesome; or
    (13) its labeling would deceive or mislead the purchaser with respect to its composition or
suitability.
108TH DAY]                          TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 2012                                          6323

    (b) Food is also misbranded if it is a raw agricultural commodity which is the product of the
soil, bearing or containing a pesticide applied after harvest, unless the shipping container of that
commodity bears labeling which declares the presence of the chemical in or on the commodity and
the common or usual name and the function of the chemical. No such declaration is required while
the commodity, having been removed from the shipping container, is being held or displayed for
sale at retail out of the container in accordance with the custom of the trade.
   Sec. 27. [34A.04] ENFORCEMENT.
    Subdivision 1. Enforcement required. (a) The commissioner shall enforce this chapter and
chapters 28, 28A, 29, 30, 31, 31A, and 34. To carry out the enforcement duties under these chapters,
the commissioner may, upon presenting appropriate credentials, during regular working hours and
at other reasonable times, inspect premises subject to the commissioner's enforcement and licensing
authority; require information from persons with information relevant to an inspection; and inspect
and copy relevant papers and records, including business records.
    (b) The commissioner may administer oaths, take and cause to be taken depositions of witnesses,
and issue subpoenas, and may petition the district court in the county in which the premises is located
to compel compliance with subpoenas or to permit an inspection.
   (c) Violations of chapters 28, 28A, 29, 30, 31, 31A, and 34, or rules adopted under chapters 28,
28A, 29, 30, 31, 31A, and 34 are a violation of this chapter.
   (d) Upon the request of the commissioner, county attorneys, sheriffs, and other officers having
authority in the enforcement of the general criminal laws shall take action to the extent of their
authority necessary or proper for the enforcement of this chapter or standards, stipulations, and
agreements of the commissioner.
   Subd. 2. Commissioner's discretion. If minor violations of this chapter occur or the
commissioner believes the public interest will be best served by a suitable notice of warning in
writing, this chapter does not require the commissioner to take any additional action.
    Subd. 3. Civil actions. Civil judicial enforcement actions may be brought by the attorney general
in the name of the state on behalf of the commissioner. A county attorney may bring a civil judicial
enforcement action upon the request of the commissioner and agreement by the attorney general.
    Subd. 4. Injunction. The commissioner may apply to a court with jurisdiction for a temporary

or administrative penalty if the commissioner determines that the remedy is in the public interest.
    (b) For facilities required to submit a plan review under rules of the commissioner of agriculture,
the commissioner may withdraw by written order the approval of a facility or equipment if:

fraudulent or deceptive practices to evade or attempt to evade provisions of this chapter.
   (c) Any action under this subdivision may be appealed pursuant to section 34A.08.
    Subd. 2. License revocation, suspension, and refusal. (a) The commissioner may revoke,

certification if a person violates or has violated this chapter within the last three years.
    (b) The commissioner may revoke, suspend, limit, modify, or refuse to grant or renew a
registration, listing, permit, license, or certification to a person from another state if that person has
had a registration, permit, license, or certification denied, revoked, or suspended by another state
for an offense reasonably related to the requirements, qualifications, or duties of a registration,
permit, license, or certification issued under this chapter.
    (c) The commissioner may revoke, suspend, limit, modify, or refuse to grant or renew a

that the registrant, permittee, licensee, or certificate holder has used fraudulent and deceptive
practices in the evasion or attempted evasion of this chapter.
    (d) A registration, listing, permit, license, or certification may not be revoked or suspended until

health and the environment, the willfulness of the violation, number of violations, history of past
108TH DAY]                           TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 2012                                         6325

violations, and other factors justice may require, if the additional factors are specifically identified in
the inspection report. For a violation after an initial violation, the commissioner shall also consider
the similarity of the most recent previous violation and the violation to be penalized, the time elapsed
since the last violation, the number of previous violations, and the response of the person to the most
recent previous violation identified.
    (b) The commissioner may issue an administrative citation assessing an administrative penalty of
up to $1,500 for each violation of this chapter. Each day a violation continues is a separate violation.
The citation must describe the nature of the violation, the statute or rule alleged to have been violated,
the time for correction, if applicable, and the amount of any proposed fine. The citation must advise
the person to notify the commissioner in writing within 20 days, or another time period mutually
agreed to by the commissioner and the person subject to the citation, if the person wishes to appeal
the citation, and that if the person fails to appeal the citation, the citation is the final order and not
subject to further review.
   (c) An administrative penalty may be assessed if the person subject to a written order does not
comply with the order in the time provided in the order.
    Subd. 2. Collection of penalty. (a) If a person subject to an administrative penalty fails to pay
the penalty, which must be part of a final citation by the commissioner, by 30 days after the final
order is issued, the commissioner may commence a civil action for double the assessed penalty plus
attorney fees and costs.
    (b) An administrative penalty may be recovered in a civil action in the name of the state brought
in the district court of the county where the violation is alleged to have occurred or the district court
where the commissioner has an office.
   Sec. 31. [34A.08] APPEAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION OR PENALTY.
    Subdivision 1. Notice of appeal. (a) After service of a citation under section 34A.07 or order
under section 34A.06, subdivision 1, a person has 20 days from receipt of the citation or order, or
another time period mutually agreed to by the commissioner and the person subject to the citation
or order, to notify the commissioner in writing that the person intends to contest the citation or
order through a hearing. The hearing request must specifically identify the order or citation being
contested and state the grounds for contesting it.
    (b) If the person fails to notify the commissioner that the person intends to contest the citation
or order, the citation or order is final and not subject to further judicial or administrative review.
    Subd. 2. Administrative review. If a person notifies the commissioner that the person intends
to contest a citation or order issued under this chapter, the Office of Administrative Hearings
shall conduct a hearing in accordance with the applicable provisions of chapter 14 for hearings in

in connection with this chapter is subject to a civil penalty of up to $7,500 per day of violation as
determined by the court.
6326                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [108TH DAY

    Subd. 2. Actions to compel performance. In an action to compel performance of an order of
the commissioner to enforce this chapter, the court must require a defendant adjudged responsible to
perform the acts within the person's power that are reasonably necessary to accomplish the purposes
of the order.
    Subd. 3. Recovery of penalties by civil action. The civil penalties and payments provided for
in this section may be recovered by a civil action brought by the county attorney or the attorney
general in the name of the state.
   Sec. 33. [34A.10] CRIMINAL PENALTIES.
    Subdivision 1. General violation. Except as provided in subdivisions 2 and 3, a person is guilty
of a misdemeanor if the person violates this chapter or an order, standard, citation, stipulation,
agreement, or schedule of compliance of the commissioner, or impedes, hinders, or otherwise
prevents, or attempts to prevent the commissioner or a duly authorized agent in performance of
a duty in connection with this chapter. Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, each separate
violation is a separate offense, except that in the case of a violation through continuing failure or
neglect to obey this chapter, each day the failure or neglect continues is a separate offense.
    Subd. 2. Violation endangering humans or animals. A person is guilty of a gross misdemeanor
if the person violates this chapter or an order, standard, stipulation, agreement, or schedule of
compliance of the commissioner and the violation endangers humans or animals.
   Subd. 3. Violation with knowledge. A person is guilty of a gross misdemeanor if the person
knowingly violates this chapter or an order, standard, stipulation, agreement, or schedule of
compliance of the commissioner.
   Sec. 34. [34A.11] EMBARGO, SEIZURE, AND CONDEMNATION.
    Subdivision 1. Tag, notice, or withdrawal from distribution. If the commissioner finds
probable cause to believe that any food, animal, or consumer commodity is being distributed in
violation of this chapter or rules under this chapter, or is adulterated or so misbranded as to be
dangerous or fraudulent, the commissioner shall affix to the food, animal, or consumer commodity
a tag, withdrawal from distribution order, or other appropriate marking giving notice that the food,
animal, or consumer commodity is, or is suspected of being, adulterated, misbranded, or distributed
in violation of this chapter, and has been detained or embargoed, and warning all persons not
to remove or dispose of the food, animal, or consumer commodity by sale or otherwise until
permission for removal or disposal is given by the commissioner or the court. It is unlawful for a
person to remove or dispose of a detained or embargoed food, animal, or consumer commodity
by sale or otherwise without the commissioner's or a court's permission and each transaction is a
separate violation of this subdivision.
    Subd. 2. Seizure. A carcass; part of a carcass; meat or meat food product of an animal; or dead,
dying, disabled, or diseased animal that is being transported in intrastate commerce, or is held for
sale in this state after transportation in intrastate commerce, may be proceeded against, seized, and
condemned if:
    (1) it is or has been prepared, sold, transported, or otherwise distributed, offered, or received for
distribution in violation of this chapter;
   (2) it is usable as human food and is adulterated or misbranded; or
108TH DAY]                          TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 2012                                       6327

   (3) it is in any other way in violation of this chapter.
   The commissioner may act against the article or animal at any time on a complaint in the district
court of the judicial district where the article or animal is found.
    Subd. 3. Action for condemnation. If food or an article or animal detained or embargoed under
subdivision 1 has been found by the commissioner to be adulterated or misbranded or in violation
of this chapter, the commissioner shall petition the district court in the county in which the food or
animal is detained or embargoed for an order and decree for the condemnation of the food or animal.
The commissioner shall release the food or animal when this chapter and rules adopted under this
chapter have been complied with or the food or animal is found to be not adulterated or misbranded.
    Subd. 4. Remedies. If the court finds that a detained or embargoed food or animal is adulterated,
misbranded, or in violation of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter, the following remedies
are available:
   (1) after entering a decree, the food or animal may be destroyed at the expense of the claimant
under the supervision of the commissioner, and all court costs, fees, storage, and other proper
expenses must be assessed against the claimant of the food or animal or the claimant's agent; and
    (2) if adulteration or misbranding can be corrected by proper labeling or processing of the food
or animal, the court, after entry of the decree and after costs, fees, and expenses have been paid and a
good and sufficient bond, conditioned that the food or animal must be properly labeled or processed,
has been executed, may by order direct that the food or animal be delivered to the claimant for proper
labeling or processing under the supervision of the commissioner. The expense of the supervision
must be paid by the claimant. The food or animal must be returned to the claimant and the bond
must be discharged on the representation to the court by the commissioner that the food or animal
is no longer in violation and that the expenses for the supervision have been paid.
    Subd. 5. Duties of commissioner. If the commissioner finds in any room, building, vehicle of
transportation, or other structure any meat, seafood, poultry, vegetable, fruit, or other perishable
articles of food that are unsound, or contain any filthy, decomposed, or putrid substance, or that
may be poisonous or deleterious to health or otherwise unsafe, the commissioner shall condemn or
destroy the item or in any other manner render the item as unsalable as human food, and no one has
any cause of action against the commissioner on account of the commissioner's action.
    Subd. 6. Emergency response. If the governor declares an emergency order under section
12.31 and if the commissioner finds or has probable cause to believe that livestock, food, or a
consumer commodity within a specific area is likely to be adulterated because of the emergency or
so misbranded as to be dangerous or fraudulent, or is in violation of section 31.131, subdivision
1, the commissioner may embargo a geographic area that is included in the declared emergency.
The commissioner shall provide notice to the public and to those with custody of the product in as
thorough a manner as is practicable under the emergency circumstances.
   Sec. 35. [34A.12] POWERS OF THE COMMISSIONER.
   Subdivision 1. Gathering information. The commissioner may, for the purposes of this chapter:
    (1) gather and compile information concerning and investigate the organization, business,
conduct, practices, and management of a person in intrastate commerce and the person's relation
to other persons; and
6328                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [108TH DAY

    (2) require, by general or special orders, a person, persons, or a class of persons engaged
in intrastate commerce to file with the commissioner, in the form the commissioner prescribes,
annual and special reports or answers in writing to specific questions, giving the commissioner
the information the commissioner requires about the organization, business, conduct, practices,
management, and relation to other persons, of the person filing the reports or answers. The reports
and answers must be made under oath, or otherwise, as the commissioner prescribes, and filed with
the commissioner within a reasonable time the commissioner prescribes, unless additional time is
granted by the commissioner.
    Subd. 2. Examination of documents for evidence. (a) For purposes of this chapter, the
commissioner must at all reasonable times be allowed to examine and copy documentary evidence
of a person being investigated or proceeded against. The commissioner may subpoena witnesses
and require the production of documentary evidence of a person relating to any matter under
investigation. The commissioner may sign subpoenas, administer oaths and affirmations, examine
witnesses, and receive evidence.
    (b) Attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence may be required at a
designated hearing place. In case of disobedience to a subpoena, the commissioner may invoke the
aid of the district court to require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of
documentary evidence.
    (c) The district court, in case of refusal to obey a subpoena issued to a person, may issue an
order requiring the person to appear before the commissioner or to produce documentary evidence
if ordered, or to give evidence touching the matter in question. Failure to obey the order of the court
may be punishable by the court as a contempt.
    (d) Upon the application of the attorney general at the request of the commissioner, the district
court may order a person to comply with this chapter or an order of the commissioner made under
this chapter.
    (e) The commissioner may order testimony to be taken by deposition in a proceeding or
investigation pending under this chapter at any state of the proceeding or investigation. Depositions
may be taken before a person designated by the commissioner and having power to administer
oaths. The testimony must be reduced to writing by the person taking the deposition or under
the person's direction and must then be signed by the witness. A person may be compelled to
appear and depose and to produce documentary evidence in the same manner as witnesses may be
compelled to appear and testify and produce documentary evidence before the commissioner.
    (f) Witnesses summoned before the commissioner may be paid the same fees and mileage that
are paid witnesses in the district courts. Witnesses whose depositions are taken and the persons
taking them may be entitled to the fees that are paid for those services in the district court.
    (g) A person is not excused from attending and testifying or from producing books,
papers, schedules of charges, contracts, agreements, or other documentary evidence before the
commissioner or in obedience to the subpoena of the commissioner whether the subpoena is
signed or issued by the commissioner or the commissioner's agent, or in any cause or proceeding,
criminal or otherwise, based upon or growing out of an alleged violation of this chapter because the
testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of the person may tend to incriminate
the person or subject the person to a penalty or forfeiture. No person may be prosecuted or subjected
to a penalty or forfeiture on account of a matter concerning which the person is compelled, after
108TH DAY]                          TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 2012                                       6329

having claimed a privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence, documentary
or otherwise, except that a witness is not exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury
committed in testifying.
    Subd. 3. Penalties related to testimony and records. (a) A person who neglects or refuses to
attend and testify, to answer a lawful inquiry, or to produce documentary evidence, if it is in the
person's power to do so in obedience to the subpoena or lawful requirement of the commissioner, is
guilty of a misdemeanor.
   (b) A person who willfully:
   (1) makes or causes to be made a false entry or statement of fact in a report required under this
chapter;
   (2) makes or causes to be made a false entry in an account, record, or memorandum kept by a
person subject to this chapter;
   (3) neglects or fails to make or to cause to be made full and correct entries in the accounts,
records, or memoranda of all facts and transactions relating to the person's business;
   (4) leaves the jurisdiction of this state;
    (5) mutilates, alters, or by any other means falsifies documentary evidence of a person subject
to this chapter; or
    (6) refuses to submit to the commissioner, for inspection and copying, any documentary evidence
of a person subject to this chapter in the person's possession or control, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
    (c) A person required by this chapter to file an annual or special report who fails to do so within
the time fixed by the commissioner for filing the report and continues the failure for 30 days after
notice of failure to file, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
   (d) An officer or employee of this state who makes public information obtained by the
commissioner without the commissioner's authority, unless directed by a court, is guilty of a
misdemeanor.

dispute and recommend as follows:
    That the Senate recede from its amendment and that H. F. No. 1974 be further amended as

   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 179A.20, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
   Subd. 6. Contract in effect. (a) During the period after contract expiration and prior to the date
when the right to strike matures, and for additional time if the parties agree, the terms of an existing
contract shall continue in effect and shall be enforceable upon both parties, except as provided in
paragraph (b).
    (b) A contract term does not continue in effect and is not enforceable after the expiration date
stated in the contract, and the parties may not agree to extend or honor a contract term beyond the
expiration date of the contract if the contract term would:
   (1) provide a wage or salary increase to an employee, including but not limited to an increase
based on cost of living, longevity, education or training, or performance or merit; or
   (2) provide an increase in the dollar amount of an employer contribution for insurance benefits
above the amount paid under the expired contract.
    (c) Paragraph (b) does not apply to the state employee law enforcement unit, the state employee
correctional guards unit, the University of Minnesota law enforcement unit, or to other firefighters,
peace officers subject to licensure under sections 626.84 to 626.863, or guards at correctional
facilities.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment. For
a collective bargaining agreement that expired before the effective date of this section, the
requirements of this section apply to limit wages and benefits to the levels and amounts in effect
on the effective date of this section."
   We request the adoption of this report and repassage of the bill.

The Honorable Kurt Zellers
Speaker of the House of Representatives
The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
    We, the undersigned conferees for H. F. No. 2294 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
    That the Senate recede from its amendments and that H. F. No. 2294 be further amended as
follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
                                            "ARTICLE 1
                                         HEALTH CARE
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 62E.14, subdivision 4g, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 4g. Waiver of preexisting conditions for persons covered by healthy Minnesota
contribution program. A person may enroll in the comprehensive plan with a waiver of the
preexisting condition limitation in subdivision 3 if the person is eligible for the healthy Minnesota
contribution program, and has been denied coverage as described under section 256L.031,
subdivision 6. The six-month durational residency requirement specified in section 62E.02,
subdivision 13, does not apply to individuals enrolled in the healthy Minnesota contribution
program.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 72A.201, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
    Subd. 8. Standards for claim denial. The following acts by an insurer, adjuster, or self-insured,
or self-insurance administrator constitute unfair settlement practices:
   (1) denying a claim or any element of a claim on the grounds of a specific policy provision,
condition, or exclusion, without informing the insured of the policy provision, condition, or
exclusion on which the denial is based;
   (2) denying a claim without having made a reasonable investigation of the claim;
   (3) denying a liability claim because the insured has requested that the claim be denied;
    (4) denying a liability claim because the insured has failed or refused to report the claim, unless
an independent evaluation of available information indicates there is no liability;
   (5) denying a claim without including the following information:
   (i) the basis for the denial;

    (ii) the name, address, and telephone number of the insurer's claim service office or the claim
representative of the insurer to whom the insured or claimant may take any questions or complaints
about the denial;
     (iii) the claim number and the policy number of the insured; and
   (iv) if the denied claim is a fire claim, the insured's right to file with the Department of
Commerce a complaint regarding the denial, and the address and telephone number of the
Department of Commerce;
   (6) denying a claim because the insured or claimant failed to exhibit the damaged property
unless:
    (i) the insurer, within a reasonable time period, made a written demand upon the insured or
claimant to exhibit the property; and
     (ii) the demand was reasonable under the circumstances in which it was made;
     (7) denying a claim by an insured or claimant based on the evaluation of a chemical dependency
claim reviewer selected by the insurer unless the reviewer meets the qualifications specified under
subdivision 8a. An insurer that selects chemical dependency reviewers to conduct claim evaluations
must annually file with the commissioner of commerce a report containing the specific evaluation
standards and criteria used in these evaluations. The report must be filed at the same time its annual
statement is submitted under section 60A.13. T              ญh ญญ

health risk in a managed care or county-based purchasing plan's membership in the baseline year
compared to the measurement year, and work with the managed care or county-based purchasing
plan to account for differences that they agree are significant.
    The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the
following calendar year if the managed care plan or county-based purchasing plan demonstrates

   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.69, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 32. Initiatives to reduce incidence of low birth weight. The commissioner shall
require managed care and county-based purchasing plans, as a condition of contract, to implement
strategies to reduce the incidence of low birth weight in geographic areas identified by the
commissioner as having a higher than average incidence of low birth weight. The strategies must
coordinate health care with social services and the local public health system. Each plan shall
develop and report to the commissioner outcome measures related to reducing the incidence of
low birth weight. The commissioner shall consider the outcomes reported when considering plan
participation in the competitive bidding program established under subdivision 33.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.69, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 33. Competitive bidding. (a) For managed care contracts effective on or after January 1,
2014, the commissioner may utilize a competitive price bidding program for nonelderly, nondisabled
adults and children in medical assistance and MinnesotaCare in the seven-county metropolitan area.
The program must allow a minimum of two managed care plans to serve the metropolitan area.
   (b) In designing the competitive bid program, the commissioner shall consider, and incorporate
where appropriate, the procedures and criteria used in the competitive bidding pilot authorized
under Laws 2011, First Special Session chapter 9, article 6, section 96. The pilot program operating
in Hennepin County under the authority of section 256B.0756 shall continue to be exempt from
competitive bid.
    (c) The commissioner shall use past performance data as a factor in selecting vendors and shall
consider this information, along with competitive bid and other information, in determining whether
to contract with a managed care plan under this subdivision. Where possible, the assessment of past
performance in serving persons on public programs shall be based on encounter data submitted
to the commissioner. The commissioner shall evaluate past performance based on both the health
outcomes of care and success rates in securing participation in recommended preventive and early
diagnostic care. Data provided by managed care plans must be provided in a uniform manner as
specified by the commissioner and must include only data on medical assistance and MinnesotaCare
enrollees. The data submitted must include health outcome measures on reducing the incidence of
low birth weight established by the managed care plan under subdivision 32.

population. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of
the following calendar year if performance targets in the contract are achieved.
    (c) For services rendered on or after January 1, 2011, the commissioner shall withhold an
additional three percent of managed care plan or county-based purchasing plan payments under

of the following calendar year. The return of the withhold under this paragraph is not subject to the
requirements of paragraph (b).
    (d) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2011,
the commissioner shall include as part of the performance targets described in paragraph (b) a
reduction in the plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees by
a measurable rate of five percent from the plan's utilization rate for the previous calendar year.
Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2012, the commissioner shall include as part
of the performance targets described in paragraph (b) a reduction in the health plan's emergency
department utilization rate for medical assistance and MinnesotaCare enrollees, as determined
by the commissioner. For 2012, the reductions shall be based on the health plan's utilization
in 2009. To earn the return of the withhold each subsequent year, the managed care plan or
county-based purchasing plan must achieve a qualifying reduction of no less than ten percent of
the plan's utilization rate for medical assistance and MinnesotaCare enrollees, excluding M ญญ

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective June 1, 2012.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256D.06, subdivision 1b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1b. Earned income savings account. In addition to the $50 disregard required under
subdivision 1, the county agency shall disregard an additional earned income up to a maximum
of $ญ1
     ญ5ญ0
        ญ $500 per month for: (1) persons residing in facilities licensed under Minnesota Rules,
parts 9520.0500 to 9520.0690 and 9530.2500 to 9530.4000, and for whom discharge and work
are part of a treatment plan; (2) persons living in supervised apartments with services funded under
Minnesota Rules, parts 9535.0100 to 9535.1600, and for whom discharge and work are part of a
treatment plan; and (3) persons residing in group residential housing, as that term is defined in
section 256I.03, subdivision 3, for whom the county agency has approved a discharge plan which
includes work. The additional amount disregarded must be placed in a separate savings account by
the eligible individual, to be used upon discharge from the residential facility into the community.
For individuals residing in a chemical dependency program licensed under Minnesota Rules, part
9530.4100, subpart 22, item D, withdrawals from the savings account require the signature of the
individual and for those individuals with an authorized representative payee, the signature of the
payee. A maximum of $   ญ1ญญ0

                               0 $2,000, including interest, of the money in the savings account must
be excluded from the resource limits established by section 256D.08, subdivision 1, clause (1).

                                              ญญ
If excluded money is removed from the savings account by the eligible individual at any time
before the individual is discharged from the facility into the community, the money is income to
the individual in the month of receipt and a resource in subsequent months. If an eligible individual
moves from a community facility to an inpatient hospital setting, the separate savings account is
an excluded asset for up to 18 months. During that time, amounts that accumulate in excess of the
ญ1
$ ญญ0
   ,ญ0 ญ $2,000 savings limit must be applied to the patient's cost of care. If the patient continues to
      ญ0
be hospitalized at the conclusion of the 18-month period, the entire account must be applied to the
patient's cost of care.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective October 1, 2012.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 256E.35, subdivision 5, is amended to

requirements of the federal Assets for Independence Act, Public Law 105-285, in Title IV, section
408 of that act.
    (b) Each participating household must sign a family asset agreement that includes the amount

household must transfer funds withdrawn from a family asset account to its matching fund custodial
account held by the fiscal agent, according to the family asset agreement. The fiscal agent must
determine if the match request is for a permissible use consistent with the household's family asset
agreement.
   The fiscal agent must ensure the household's custodial account contains the applicable matching
funds to match the balance in the household's account, including interest, on at least a quarterly basis
and at the time of an approved withdrawal. Matches must be provided as follows:
   (1) from state grant and TANF funds, a matching contribution of $1.50 for every $1 of funds
withdrawn from the family asset account equal to the lesser of $720 per year or a $3,000 lifetime
limit; and
   (2) from nonstate funds, a matching contribution of no less than $1.50 for every $1 of funds
withdrawn from the family asset account equal to the lesser of $720 per year or a $3,000 lifetime
limit.
   (b) Upon receipt of transferred custodial account funds, the fiscal agent must make a direct
payment to the vendor of the goods or services for the permissible use.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256E.37, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Grant authority. The commissioner may make grants to state agencies and
political subdivisions to construct or rehabilitate facilities for early childhood programs, crisis
nurseries, or parenting time centers. The following requirements apply:
    (1) The facilities must be owned by the state or a political subdivision, but may be leased under
section 16A.695 to organizations that operate the programs. The commissioner must prescribe the
terms and conditions of the leases.
    (2) A grant for an individual facility must not exceed $500,000 for each program that is housed
in the facility, up to a maximum of $2,000,000 for a facility that houses three programs or more.
Programs include Head Start, School Readiness, Early Childhood Family Education, licensed child
care, and other early childhood intervention programs.
   (3) State appropriations must be matched on a 50 percent basis with nonstate funds. The
matching requirement must apply program wide and not to individual grants.
    (4) At least 80 percent of grant funds must be distributed to facilities located in counties not
included in the definition under section 473.121, subdivision 4.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 256I.05, subdivision 1a, is amended to

subdivision 3, the county agency may negotiate a payment not to exceed $426.37 for other services
necessary to provide room and board provided by the group residence if the residence is licensed
by or registered by the Department of Health, or licensed by the Department of Human Services
to provide services in addition to room and board, and if the provider of services is not also
concurrently receiving funding for services for a recipient under a home and community-based
waiver under title XIX of the Social Security Act; or funding from the medical assistance program

under section 256B.0659, for personal care services for residents in the setting; or residing in a
setting which receives funding under Minnesota Rules, parts 9535.2000 to 9535.3000. If funding
is available for other necessary services through a home and community-based waiver, or personal
care services under section 256B.0659, then the GRH rate is limited to the rate set in subdivision 1.
Unless otherwise provided in law, in no case may the supplementary service rate exceed $426.37.
The registration and licensure requirement does not apply to establishments which are exempt
from state licensure because they are located on Indian reservations and for which the tribe has
prescribed health and safety requirements. Service payments under this section may be prohibited
under rules to prevent the supplanting of federal funds with state funds. The commissioner shall
pursue the feasibility of obtaining the approval of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to
provide home and community-based waiver services under title XIX of the Social Security Act for
residents who are not eligible for an existing home and community-based waiver due to a primary
diagnosis of mental illness or chemical dependency and shall apply for a waiver if it is determined
to be cost-effective.
    (b) The commissioner is authorized to make cost-neutral transfers from the GRH fund for beds
under this section to other funding programs administered by the department after consultation with
the county or counties in which the affected beds are located. The commissioner may also make
cost-neutral transfers from the GRH fund to county human service agencies for beds permanently
removed from the GRH census under a plan submitted by the county agency and approved by
the commissioner. The commissioner shall report the amount of any transfers under this provision
annually to the legislature.
    (c) The provisions of paragraph (b) do not apply to a facility that has its reimbursement rate
established under section 256B.431, subdivision 4, paragraph (c).
    (d) Counties must not negotiate supplementary service rates with providers of group residential
housing that are licensed as board and lodging with special services and that do not encourage a
policy of sobriety on their premises and make referrals to available community services for volunteer
and employment opportunities for residents.
      Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256I.05, subdivision 1e, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1e. Supplementary rate for certain facilities. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of
subdivisions 1a and 1c, beginning July 1, 2005, a county agency shall negotiate a supplementary
rate in addition to the rate specified in subdivision 1, not to exceed $700 per month, including any
legislatively authorized inflationary adjustments, for a group residential housing provider that:

county since June 1996;
      (2) operates in three separate locations a 75-bed facility, a 50-bed facility, and a 26-bed facility;
and
    (3) serves a chemically dependent clientele, providing 24 hours per day supervision and limiting
a resident's maximum length of stay to 13 months out of a consecutive 24-month period.
    (b) Notwithstanding subdivisions 1a and 1c, a county agency shall negotiate a supplementary
rate in addition to the rate specified in subdivision 1, not to exceed $700 per month, including any
legislatively authorized inflationary adjustments, of a group residential provider that:

and limiting a resident's maximum length of stay to 13 months out of a consecutive 24-month period.
    (c) Notwithstanding subdivisions 1a and 1c, beginning July 1, 2013, a county agency shall
negotiate a supplementary rate in addition to the rate specified in subdivision 1, not to exceed $700
per month, including any legislatively authorized inflationary adjustments, for the group residential
provider described under paragraphs (a) and (b), not to exceed an additional 115 beds.

   (1) Benefits for the entire assistance unit must be paid in vendor form for shelter and utilities
during any time the applicant is part of the assistance unit.
    (2) The convicted applicant or participant shall be subject to random drug testing as a condition
of continued eligibility and following any positive test for an illegal controlled substance is subject
to the following sanctions:
    (i) for failing a drug test the first time, the residual amount of the participant's grant after making
vendor payments for shelter and utility costs, if any, must be reduced by an amount equal to 30
percent of the MFIP standard of need for an assistance unit of the same size. When a sanction under
this subdivision is in effect, the job counselor must attempt to meet with the person face-to-face.
During the face-to-face meeting, the job counselor must explain the consequences of a subsequent
drug test failure and inform the participant of the right to appeal the sanction under section 256J.40.
If a face-to-face meeting is not possible, the county agency must send the participant a notice of
adverse action as provided in section 256J.31, subdivisions 4 and 5, and must include the information
required in the face-to-face meeting; or
    (ii) for failing a drug test two times, the participant is permanently disqualified from receiving
MFIP assistance, both the cash and food portions. The assistance unit's MFIP grant must be reduced
by the amount which would have otherwise been made available to the disqualified participant.
Disqualification under this item does not make a participant ineligible for food stamps or food
support. Before a disqualification under this provision is imposed, the job counselor must attempt
to meet with the participant face-to-face. During the face-to-face meeting, the job counselor must
identify other resources that may be available to the participant to meet the needs of the family
and inform the participant of the right to appeal the disqualification under section 256J.40. If a
face-to-face meeting is not possible, the county agency must send the participant a notice of adverse
action as provided in section 256J.31, subdivisions 4 and 5, and must include the information

    (3) A participant who fails a drug test the first time and is under a sanction due to other MFIP
program requirements is considered to have more than one occurrence of noncompliance and
is subject to the applicable level of sanction as specified under section 256J.46, subdivision 1,
paragraph (d).
    (b) Applicants requesting only food stamps or food support or participants receiving only food
stamps or food support, who have been convicted of a drug offense that occurred after July 1,
1997, may, if otherwise eligible, receive food stamps or food support if the convicted applicant
or participant is subject to random drug testing as a condition of continued eligibility. Following a
positive test for an illegal controlled substance, the applicant is subject to the following sanctions:
    (1) for failing a drug test the first time, food stamps or food support shall be reduced by an amount
equal to 30 percent of the applicable food stamp or food support allotment. When a sanction under
this clause is in effect, a job counselor must attempt to meet with the person face-to-face. During the
face-to-face meeting, a job counselor must explain the consequences of a subsequent drug test failure
and inform the participant of the right to appeal the sanction under section 256J.40. If a face-to-face
meeting is not possible, a county agency must send the participant a notice of adverse action as
provided in section 256J.31, subdivisions 4 and 5, and must include the information required in the
face-to-face meeting; and
    (2) for failing a drug test two times, the participant is permanently disqualified from receiving

     Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256J.575, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
    Subd. 8. Funding. (a) The commissioner of human services shall treat MFIP expenditures made
to or on behalf of any minor child under this section, who is part of a household that meets criteria
in subdivision 3, as expenditures under a separately funded state program. These expenditures shall
not count toward the state's maintenance of effort requirements under the federal TANF program.
     (b) A family is no longer part of a separately funded program under this section if the caregiver

     (7) the location of the alleged offense;
     (8) the alleged offense; and
     (9) any other information the commissioner of human services deems necessary.
    Subd. 2. Use of information collected. The head of a local law enforcement agency or state law
enforcement department that employs peace officers licensed under section 626.843 must forward

possession.
   Subd. 3. Reporting forms. The commissioner of human services, in consultation with the
superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, shall adopt reporting forms to be used by
law enforcement agencies in making the reports required under this section.
   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 626.556, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 10n. Required referral to early intervention services. A child under age three who is
involved in a substantiated case of maltreatment shall be referred for screening under the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act, part C. Parents must be informed that the evaluation and acceptance
of services are voluntary. The commissioner of human services shall monitor referral rates by county
and annually report the information to the legislature beginning March 15, 2014. Refusal to have a
child screened is not a basis for a child in need of protection or services petition under chapter 260C.

reduced capacity required under paragraph (e) will be implemented. The commissioner shall consult
with the stakeholders described in section 144A.351, and employ a variety of methods to improve
the state's capacity to meet long-term care service needs within budgetary limits, including seeking
proposals from service providers or lead agencies to change service type, capacity, or location to
improve services, increase the independence of residents, and better meet needs identified by the
long-term care services reports and statewide data and information. By February 1 of each year,

    Subd. 7. Adult foster care; variance for alternate overnight supervision. (a) The
commissioner may grant a variance under section 245A.04, subdivision 9, to rule parts requiring
a caregiver to be present in an adult foster care home during normal sleeping hours to allow for
alternative methods of overnight supervision. The commissioner may grant the variance if the
local county licensing agency recommends the variance and the county recommendation includes
documentation verifying that:
   (1) the county has approved the license holder's plan for alternative methods of providing
overnight supervision and determined the plan protects the residents' health, safety, and rights;
   (2) the license holder has obtained written and signed informed consent from each resident or
each resident's legal representative documenting the resident's or legal representative's agreement
with the alternative method of overnight supervision; and
    (3) the alternative method of providing overnight supervision, which may include the use
of technology, is specified for each resident in the resident's: (i) individualized plan of care; (ii)
individual service plan under section 256B.092, subdivision 1b, if required; or (iii) individual
resident placement agreement under Minnesota Rules, part 9555.5105, subpart 19, if required.

    (c) A license holder requesting a variance under this subdivision to utilize technology as a
component of a plan for alternative overnight supervision may request the commissioner's review
in the absence of a county recommendation. Upon receipt of such a request from a license holder,
the commissioner shall review the variance request with the county.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 245A.11, subdivision 7a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7a. Alternate overnight supervision technology; adult foster care license. (a) The
commissioner may grant an applicant or license holder an adult foster care license for a residence that
does not have a caregiver in the residence during normal sleeping hours as required under Minnesota
Rules, part 9555.5105, subpart 37, item B, but uses monitoring technology to alert the license holder
when an incident occurs that may jeopardize the health, safety, or rights of a foster care recipient.
The applicant or license holder must comply with all other requirements under Minnesota Rules,
parts 9555.5105 to 9555.6265, and the requirements under this subdivision. The license printed by
the commissioner must state in bold and large font:
   (1) that the facility is under electronic monitoring; and
   (2) the telephone number of the county's common entry point for making reports of suspected
maltreatment of vulnerable adults under section 626.557, subdivision 9.
    (b) Applications for a license under this section must be submitted directly to the Department of
Human Services licensing division. The licensing division must immediately notify the host county
and lead county contract agency and the host county licensing agency. The licensing division must
collaborate with the county licensing agency in the review of the application and the licensing of
the program.

    (c) Before a license is issued by the commissioner, and for the duration of the license, the
applicant or license holder must establish, maintain, and document the implementation of written
policies and procedures addressing the requirements in paragraphs (d) through (f).
   (d) The applicant or license holder must have policies and procedures that:
   (1) establish characteristics of target populations that will be admitted into the home, and
characteristics of populations that will not be accepted into the home;
   (2) explain the discharge process when a foster care recipient requires overnight supervision or
other services that cannot be provided by the license holder due to the limited hours that the license
holder is on site;
   (3) describe the types of events to which the program will respond with a physical presence
when those events occur in the home during time when staff are not on site, and how the license
holder's response plan meets the requirements in paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2);
    (4) establish a process for documenting a review of the implementation and effectiveness
of the response protocol for the response required under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2). The
documentation must include:
   (i) a description of the triggering incident;
   (ii) the date and time of the triggering incident;
   (iii) the time of the response or responses under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2);
   (iv) whether the response met the resident's needs;
   (v) whether the existing policies and response protocols were followed; and
   (vi) whether the existing policies and protocols are adequate or need modification.
    When no physical presence response is completed for a three-month period, the license holder's
written policies and procedures must require a physical presence response drill to be conducted
for which the effectiveness of the response protocol under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2), will be
reviewed and documented as required under this clause; and
    (5) establish that emergency and nonemergency phone numbers are posted in a prominent
location in a common area of the home where they can be easily observed by a person responding
to an incident who is not otherwise affiliated with the home.
    (e) The license holder must document and include in the license application which response
alternative under clause (1) or (2) is in place for responding to situations that present a serious risk
to the health, safety, or rights of people receiving foster care services in the home:
    (1) response alternative (1) requires only the technology to provide an electronic notification or
alert to the license holder that an event is underway that requires a response. Under this alternative,
no more than ten minutes will pass before the license holder will be physically present on site to
respond to the situation; or
    (2) response alternative (2) requires the electronic notification and alert system under alternative
(1), but more than ten minutes may pass before the license holder is present on site to respond to
6404                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [108TH DAY

the situation. Under alternative (2), all of the following conditions are met:
    (i) the license holder has a written description of the interactive technological applications that
will assist the license holder in communicating with and assessing the needs related to the care,
health, and safety of the foster care recipients. This interactive technology must permit the license
holder to remotely assess the well being of the foster care recipient without requiring the initiation
of the foster care recipient. Requiring the foster care recipient to initiate a telephone call does not
meet this requirement;
    (ii) the license holder documents how the remote license holder is qualified and capable of
meeting the needs of the foster care recipients and assessing foster care recipients' needs under
item (i) during the absence of the license holder on site;
    (iii) the license holder maintains written procedures to dispatch emergency response personnel
to the site in the event of an identified emergency; and
    (iv) each foster care recipient's individualized plan of care, individual service plan under section
256B.092, subdivision 1b, if required, or individual resident placement agreement under Minnesota
Rules, part 9555.5105, subpart 19, if required, identifies the maximum response time, which may
be greater than ten minutes, for the license holder to be on site for that foster care recipient.

    (g) Nothing in this section requires the applicant or license holder to develop or maintain separate
or duplicative policies, procedures, documentation, consent forms, or individual plans that may be
required for other licensing standards, if the requirements of this section are incorporated into those
documents.
    (h) The commissioner may grant variances to the requirements of this section according to
section 245A.04, subdivision 9.
    (i) For the purposes of paragraphs (d) through (h), "license holder" has the meaning under section
245A.2, subdivision 9, and additionally includes all staff, volunteers, and contractors affiliated with
the license holder.
    (j) For the purposes of paragraph (e), the terms "assess" and "assessing" mean to remotely
determine what action the license holder needs to take to protect the well-being of the foster care
recipient.
    (k) The commissioner shall evaluate license applications using the requirements in paragraphs
(d) to (f). The commissioner shall provide detailed application forms, including a checklist of criteria
needed for approval.
    (l) To be eligible for a license under paragraph (a), the adult foster care license holder must not
have had a conditional license issued under section 245A.06 or any licensing sanction under section
245A.07 during the prior 24 months based on failure to provide adequate supervision, health care
services, or resident safety in the adult foster care home.
    (m) The commissioner shall review an application for an alternative overnight supervision
license within 60 days of receipt of the application. When the commissioner receives an application
that is incomplete because the applicant failed to submit required documents or that is substantially
deficient because the documents submitted do not meet licensing requirements, the commissioner
shall provide the applicant written notice that the application is incomplete or substantially
deficient. In the written notice to the applicant, the commissioner shall identify documents that
are missing or deficient and give the applicant 45 days to resubmit a second application that is
substantially complete. An applicant's failure to submit a substantially complete application after
receiving notice from the commissioner is a basis for license denial under section 245A.05. The
commissioner shall complete subsequent review within 30 days.
   (n) Once the application is considered complete under paragraph (m), the commissioner will
approve or deny an application for an alternative overnight supervision license within 60 days.
   (o) For the purposes of this subdivision, "supervision" means:
   (1) oversight by a caregiver as specified in the individual resident's place agreement and
awareness of the resident's needs and activities; and
    (2) the presence of a caregiver in a residence during normal sleeping hours, unless a
determination has been made and documented in the individual's support plan that the individual
does not require the presence of a caregiver during normal sleeping hours.

medical, and other individual-specific information, and names and telephone numbers of contacts;
    (2) consumer health information, including individual medication administration and monitoring
information;
    (3) the consumer's individual service plan. When a consumer's case manager does not provide a
current individual service plan, the license holder shall make a written request to the case manager
to provide a copy of the individual service plan and inform the consumer or the consumer's legal
representative of the right to an individual service plan and the right to appeal under section 256.045.
In the event the case manager fails to provide an individual service plan after a written request from
the license holder, the license holder shall not be sanctioned or penalized financially for not having
a current individual service plan in the consumer's data file;
   (4) copies of assessments, analyses, summaries, and recommendations;

subdivision, a repeat annual background study is not required if:
    (1) the provider maintains compliance with the requirements of section 245C.07, paragraph (a),
regarding one individual with one address and telephone number as the person to receive sensitive
background study information for the multiple programs that depend on the same background
study, and that the individual who is designated to receive the sensitive background information is

capable of determining, upon the request of the commissioner, whether a background study subject
is providing direct contact services in one or more of the provider's programs or services and, if
so, at which location or locations; and
   (2) the individual who is the subject of the background study provides direct contact services
under the provider's licensed program for at least 40 hours per year so the individual will be
recognized by a probation officer or corrections agent to prompt a report to the commissioner
regarding criminal convictions as required under section 245C.05, subdivision 7.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 245C.05, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7. Probation officer and corrections agent. (a) A probation officer or corrections agent
shall notify the commissioner of an individual's conviction if the individual ญs
                                                                              iญ:
   (1) has been affiliated with a program or facility regulated by the Department of Human

of Corrections, or any type of home care agency or provider of personal care assistance services
within the preceding year; and
   (2) has been convicted of a crime constituting a disqualification under section 245C.14.
   (b) For the purpose of this subdivision, "conviction" has the meaning given it in section 609.02,
subdivision 5.
    (c) The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of corrections, shall develop
forms and information necessary to implement this subdivision and shall provide the forms and
information to the commissioner of corrections for distribution to local probation officers and
corrections agents.
    (d) The commissioner shall inform individuals subject to a background study that criminal
convictions for disqualifying crimes will be reported to the commissioner by the corrections
system.
    (e) A probation officer, corrections agent, or corrections agency is not civilly or criminally liable
for disclosing or failing to disclose the information required by this subdivision.
   (f) Upon receipt of disqualifying information, the commissioner shall provide the notice required
under section 245C.17, as appropriate, to agencies on record as having initiated a background study
or making a request for documentation of the background study status of the individual.
   (g) This subdivision does not apply to family child care programs.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 252.27, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Contribution amount. (a) The natural or adoptive parents of a minor child, including
a child determined eligible for medical assistance without consideration of parental income, must
contribute to the cost of services used by making monthly payments on a sliding scale based on
income, unless the child is married or has been married, parental rights have been terminated, or
the child's adoption is subsidized according to section 259.67 or through title IV-E of the Social
Security Act. The parental contribution is a partial or full payment for medical services provided
for diagnostic, therapeutic, curing, treating, mitigating, rehabilitation, maintenance, and personal
care services as defined in United States Code, title 26, section 213, needed by the child with a
6408                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [108TH DAY

chronic illness or disability.
    (b) For households with adjusted gross income equal to or greater than 100 percent of federal
poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall be computed by applying the following schedule
of rates to the adjusted gross income of the natural or adoptive parents:
    (1) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 100 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution is $4
per month;
   (2) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 175 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than or equal to 545 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental
contribution shall be determined using a sliding fee scale established by the commissioner of
human services which begins at one percent of adjusted gross income at 175 percent of federal
poverty guidelines and increases to 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income for those with adjusted
gross income up to 545 percent of federal poverty guidelines;
    (3) if the adjusted gross income is greater than 545 percent of federal poverty guidelines and
less than 675 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall be 7.5 percent of
adjusted gross income;
    (4) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 675 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than 975 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall
be determined using a sliding fee scale established by the commissioner of human services which
begins at 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income at 675 percent of federal poverty guidelines and
increases to ten percent of adjusted gross income for those with adjusted gross income up to 975
percent of federal poverty guidelines; and
   (5) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 975 percent of federal poverty
guidelines, the parental contribution shall be 12.5 percent of adjusted gross income.
    If the child lives with the parent, the annual adjusted gross income is reduced by $2,400 prior
to calculating the parental contribution. If the child resides in an institution specified in section
256B.35, the parent is responsible for the personal needs allowance specified under that section
in addition to the parental contribution determined under this section. The parental contribution is
reduced by any amount required to be paid directly to the child pursuant to a court order, but only
if actually paid.
    (c) The household size to be used in determining the amount of contribution under paragraph (b)
includes natural and adoptive parents and their dependents, including the child receiving services.
Adjustments in the contribution amount due to annual changes in the federal poverty guidelines
shall be implemented on the first day of July following publication of the changes.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (b), "income" means the adjusted gross income of the natural
or adoptive parents determined according to the previous year's federal tax form, except, effective
retroactive to July 1, 2003, taxable capital gains to the extent the funds have been used to purchase
a home shall not be counted as income.
    (e) The contribution shall be explained in writing to the parents at the time eligibility for services
is being determined. The contribution shall be made on a monthly basis effective with the first month
in which the child receives services. Annually upon redetermination or at termination of eligibility, if
108TH DAY]                          TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 2012                                        6409

the contribution exceeded the cost of services provided, the local agency or the state shall reimburse
that excess amount to the parents, either by direct reimbursement if the parent is no longer required
to pay a contribution, or by a reduction in or waiver of parental fees until the excess amount is
exhausted. All reimbursements must include a notice that the amount reimbursed may be taxable
income if the parent paid for the parent's fees through an employer's health care flexible spending
account under the Internal Revenue Code, section 125, and that the parent is responsible for paying
the taxes owed on the amount reimbursed.
    (f) The monthly contribution amount must be reviewed at least every 12 months; when there
is a change in household size; and when there is a loss of or gain in income from one month to
another in excess of ten percent. The local agency shall mail a written notice 30 days in advance of
the effective date of a change in the contribution amount. A decrease in the contribution amount is
effective in the month that the parent verifies a reduction in income or change in household size.
    (g) Parents of a minor child who do not live with each other shall each pay the contribution
required under paragraph (a). An amount equal to the annual court-ordered child support payment
actually paid on behalf of the child receiving services shall be deducted from the adjusted gross
income of the parent making the payment prior to calculating the parental contribution under
paragraph (b).
    (h) The contribution under paragraph (b) shall be increased by an additional five percent if
the local agency determines that insurance coverage is available but not obtained for the child.
For purposes of this section, "available" means the insurance is a benefit of employment for a
family member at an annual cost of no more than five percent of the family's annual income. For
purposes of this section, "insurance" means health and accident insurance coverage, enrollment
in a nonprofit health service plan, health maintenance organization, self-insured plan, or preferred
provider organization.
    Parents who have more than one child receiving services shall not be required to pay more than
the amount for the child with the highest expenditures. There shall be no resource contribution from
the parents. The parent shall not be required to pay a contribution in excess of the cost of the services
provided to the child, not counting payments made to school districts for education-related services.
Notice of an increase in fee payment must be given at least 30 days before the increased fee is due.
  (i) The contribution under paragraph (b) shall be reduced by $300 per fiscal year if, in the 12
months prior to July 1:
   (1) the parent applied for insurance for the child;
   (2) the insurer denied insurance;
    (3) the parents submitted a complaint or appeal, in writing to the insurer, submitted a complaint
or appeal, in writing, to the commissioner of health or the commissioner of commerce, or litigated
the complaint or appeal; and
   (4) as a result of the dispute, the insurer reversed its decision and granted insurance.
   For purposes of this section, "insurance" has the meaning given in paragraph (h).
   A parent who has requested a reduction in the contribution amount under this paragraph shall
submit proof in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioner or county agency, including,
6410                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [108TH DAY

but not limited to, the insurer's denial of insurance, the written letter or complaint of the parents,
court documents, and the written response of the insurer approving insurance. The determinations
of the commissioner or county agency under this paragraph are not rules subject to chapter 14.
    (j) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), for the period from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2ญ0
                                                                                       ญญ13

the parental contribution shall be computed by applying the following contribution schedule to the
adjusted gross income of the natural or adoptive parents:
    (1) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 100 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution is $4
per month;
   (2) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 175 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than or equal to 525 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental
contribution shall be determined using a sliding fee scale established by the commissioner of
human services which begins at one percent of adjusted gross income at 175 percent of federal
poverty guidelines and increases to eight percent of adjusted gross income for those with adjusted
gross income up to 525 percent of federal poverty guidelines;
    (3) if the adjusted gross income is greater than 525 percent of federal poverty guidelines and
less than 675 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall be 9.5 percent of
adjusted gross income;
    (4) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 675 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than 900 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall
be determined using a sliding fee scale established by the commissioner of human services which
begins at 9.5 percent of adjusted gross income at 675 percent of federal poverty guidelines and
increases to 12 percent of adjusted gross income for those with adjusted gross income up to 900
percent of federal poverty guidelines; and
    (5) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 900 percent of federal poverty
guidelines, the parental contribution shall be 13.5 percent of adjusted gross income. If the child
lives with the parent, the annual adjusted gross income is reduced by $2,400 prior to calculating the
parental contribution. If the child resides in an institution specified in section 256B.35, the parent is
responsible for the personal needs allowance specified under that section in addition to the parental
contribution determined under this section. The parental contribution is reduced by any amount
required to be paid directly to the child pursuant to a court order, but only if actually paid.

    Subd. 3h. Service rate limits; 24-hour customized living services. (a) The payment rate for
24-hour customized living services is a monthly rate authorized by the lead agency within the
parameters established by the commissioner of human services. The payment agreement must
delineate the amount of each component service included in each recipient's customized living
service plan. The lead agency, with input from the provider of customized living services, shall

participants at their first reassessment after July 1, 2011, dependency in at least three of the
following activities of daily living as determined by assessment under section 256B.0911: bathing;
dressing; grooming; walking; or eating when the dependency score in eating is three or greater;
and needs medication management and at least 50 hours of service per month. The lead agency
shall ensure that the frequency and mode of supervision of the recipient and the qualifications of
staff providing supervision are described and meet the needs of the recipient.

Counties and tribes will use tools issued by the commissioner to develop and document customized
living plans and authorize rates.
  (d) Component service rates must not exceed payment rates for comparable elderly waiver or
medical assistance services and must reflect economies of scale.
    (e) The individually authorized 24-hour customized living payments, in combination with

mix resident class under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, to which elderly waiver
service clients are assigned. When there are fewer than 50 authorizations in effect in the case mix
resident class, the commissioner shall multiply the calculated service payment rate maximum for
the A classification by the standard weight for that classification under Minnesota Rules, parts
9549.0050 to 9549.0059, to determine the applicable payment rate maximum. Service payment
rate maximums shall be updated annually based on legislatively adopted changes to all service
rates for home and community-based service providers.

    (g) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (f), the commissioner may establish
alternative payment rate systems for 24-hour customized living services in housing with services
establishments which are freestanding buildings with a capacity of 16 or fewer, by applying a single

    Subd. 7. Screening teams. (a) For persons with developmental disabilities, screening teams
shall be established which shall evaluate the need for the level of care provided by residential-based
habilitation services, residential services, training and habilitation services, and nursing facility
services. The evaluation shall address whether home and community-based services are appropriate
for persons who are at risk of placement in an intermediate care facility for persons with
developmental disabilities, or for whom there is reasonable indication that they might require this
level of care. The screening team shall make an evaluation of need within 60 working days of a
request for service by a person with a developmental disability, and within five working days of an
emergency admission of a person to an intermediate care facility for persons with developmental
disabilities.
    (b) The screening team shall consist of the case manager for persons with developmental
disabilities, the person, the person's legal guardian or conservator, or the parent if the person is
a minor, and a qualified developmental disability professional, as defined in the Code of Federal

project that is a relocation, renovation, upgrading, or conversion completed on or after July 1,
2001, or any building project eligible for reimbursement under section 256B.434, subdivision 4f,

the replacement-costs-new per bed limit shall be $74,280 per licensed bed in multiple-bed rooms,
$92,850 per licensed bed in semiprivate rooms with a fixed partition separating the resident beds,
and $111,420 per licensed bed in single rooms. Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0060, subpart 11, item
C, subitem (2), does not apply. These amounts must be adjusted annually as specified in subdivision
3f, paragraph (a), beginning January 1, 2000. These amounts must be increased annually as specified
in subdivision 3f, paragraph (a), beginning October 1, 2012.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.431, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 45. Rate adjustments for some moratorium exception projects. Notwithstanding
any other law to the contrary, money available for moratorium exception projects under section
144A.073, subdivisions 2 and 11, shall be used to fund the incremental rate increases resulting
from this section for any nursing facility with a moratorium exception project approved under
section 144A.073, and completed after August 30, 2010, where the replacement-costs-new limits
under subdivision 17e were higher at any time after project approval than at the time of project
completion. The commissioner shall calculate the property rate increase for these facilities using
the highest set of limits; however, any rate increase under this section shall not be effective until
on or after the effective date of this section, contingent upon federal approval. No property rate
decrease shall result from this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective upon federal approval.
   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.434, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Exemptions. (a) To the extent permitted by federal law, (1) a facility that has entered
into a contract under this section is not required to file a cost report, as defined in Minnesota Rules,
part 9549.0020, subpart 13, for any year after the base year that is the basis for the calculation of
the contract payment rate for the first rate year of the alternative payment demonstration project
contract; and (2) a facility under contract is not subject to audits of historical costs or revenues, or
paybacks or retroactive adjustments based on these costs or revenues, except audits, paybacks, or
adjustments relating to the cost report that is the basis for calculation of the first rate year under the
contract.
    (b) A facility that is under contract with the commissioner under this section is not subject
to the moratorium on licensure or certification of new nursing home beds in section 144A.071,
unless the project results in a net increase in bed capacity or involves relocation of beds from
one site to another. Contract payment rates must not be adjusted to reflect any additional costs
that a nursing facility incurs as a result of a construction project undertaken under this paragraph.
In addition, as a condition of entering into a contract under this section, a nursing facility must
agree that any future medical assistance payments for nursing facility services will not reflect any
additional costs attributable to the sale of a nursing facility under this section and to construction
undertaken under this paragraph that otherwise would not be authorized under the moratorium in
section 144A.073. Nothing in this section prevents a nursing facility participating in the alternative
payment demonstration project under this section from seeking approval of an exception to the
moratorium through the process established in section 144A.073, and if approved the facility's rates
shall be adjusted to reflect the cost of the project. Nothing in this section prevents a nursing facility
participating in the alternative payment demonstration project from seeking legislative approval of
an exception to the moratorium under section 144A.071, and, if enacted, the facility's rates shall be
adjusted to reflect the cost of the project.

administration has not approved a required waiver, or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services otherwise requires cost reports to be filed prior to the waiver's approval, the commissioner
shall require a cost report for the rate year.

     ) (e) Nursing facilities participating in the alternative payment system demonstration project
must either participate in the alternative payment system quality improvement program established
by the commissioner or submit information on their own quality improvement process to the
commissioner for approval. Nursing facilities that have had their own quality improvement process
approved by the commissioner must report results for at least one key area of quality improvement
annually to the commissioner.
     Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.441, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 63. Critical access nursing facilities. (a) The commissioner, in consultation with the
commissioner of health, may designate certain nursing facilities as critical access nursing facilities.
The designation shall be granted on a competitive basis, within the limits of funds appropriated for
this purpose.
    (b) The commissioner shall request proposals from nursing facilities every two years. Proposals
must be submitted in the form and according to the timelines established by the commissioner. In
selecting applicants to designate, the commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of health,
and with input from stakeholders, shall develop criteria designed to preserve access to nursing
facility services in isolated areas, rebalance long-term care, and improve quality.
    (c) The commissioner shall allow the benefits in clauses (1) to (5) for nursing facilities designated
as critical access nursing facilities:
    (1) partial rebasing, with operating payment rates being the sum of 60 percent of the operating
payment rate determined in accordance with subdivision 54 and 40 percent of the operating payment
rate that would have been allowed had the facility not been designated;
    (2) enhanced payments for leave days. Notwithstanding section 256B.431, subdivision 2r, upon
designation as a critical access nursing facility, the commissioner shall limit payment for leave days
to 60 percent of that nursing facility's total payment rate for the involved resident, and shall allow
this payment only when the occupancy of the nursing facility, inclusive of bed hold days, is equal
to or greater than 90 percent;
    (3) two designated critical access nursing facilities, with up to 100 beds in active service, may
jointly apply to the commissioner of health for a waiver of Minnesota Rules, part 4658.0500, subpart
2, in order to jointly employ a director of nursing. The commissioner of health will consider each

   (4) the minimum threshold under section 256B.431, subdivisions 3f, paragraph (a), and 17e,
shall be 40 percent of the amount that would otherwise apply; and
   (5) notwithstanding subdivision 58, beginning October 1, 2014, the quality-based rate limits
under subdivision 50 shall apply to designated critical access nursing facilities.
    (d) Designation of a critical access nursing facility shall be for a period of two years, after
which the benefits allowed under paragraph (c) shall be removed. Designated facilities may apply
for continued designation.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.48, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6a. Referrals to Medicare providers required. Notwithstanding subdivision 1, nursing
facility providers that do not participate in or accept Medicare assignment must refer and document
the referral of dual eligible recipients for whom placement is requested and for whom the resident
would be qualified for a Medicare-covered stay to Medicare providers. The commissioner shall
audit nursing facilities that do not accept Medicare and determine if dual eligible individuals with
Medicare qualifying stays have been admitted. If such a determination is made, the commissioner
shall deny Medicaid payment for the first 20 days of that resident's stay.
   Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 256B.49, subdivision 14, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 14. Assessment and reassessment. (a) Assessments of each recipient's strengths,
informal support systems, and need for services shall be completed within 20 working days of the
recipient's request as provided in section 256B.0911. Reassessment of each recipient's strengths,
support systems, and need for services shall be conducted at least every 12 months and at other
times when there has been a significant change in the recipient's functioning. With the permission
of the recipient or the recipient's designated legal representative, the recipient's current provider of
services may submit a written report outlining their recommendations regarding the recipient's care
needs prepared by a direct service employee with at least 20 hours of service to that client. The
person conducting the assessment or reassessment must notify the provider of the date by which
this information is to be submitted. This information shall be provided to the person conducting
the assessment and the person or the person's legal representative and must be considered prior to
the finalization of the assessment or reassessment.
    (b) There must be a determination that the client requires a hospital level of care or a nursing
facility level of care as defined in section 256B.0911, subdivision 4a, paragraph (d), at initial and
subsequent assessments to initiate and maintain participation in the waiver program.
    (c) Regardless of other assessments identified in section 144.0724, subdivision 4, as appropriate
to determine nursing facility level of care for purposes of medical assistance payment for nursing
facility services, only face-to-face assessments conducted according to section 256B.0911,
subdivisions 3a, 3b, and 4d, that result in a hospital level of care determination or a nursing facility
level of care determination must be accepted for purposes of initial and ongoing access to waiver
services payment.

    (d) Persons with developmental disabilities who apply for services under the nursing facility
level waiver programs shall be screened for the appropriate level of care according to section
256B.092.
   (e) Recipients who are found eligible for home and community-based services under this section
before their 65th birthday may remain eligible for these services after their 65th birthday if they
continue to meet all other eligibility factors.
    (f) The commissioner shall develop criteria to identify recipients whose level of functioning is
reasonably expected to improve and reassess these recipients to establish a baseline assessment.
Recipients who meet these criteria must have a comprehensive transitional service plan developed
under subdivision 15, paragraphs (b) and (c), and be reassessed every six months until there has
been no significant change in the recipient's functioning for at least 12 months. After there has
been no significant change in the recipient's functioning for at least 12 months, reassessments of
the recipient's strengths, informal support systems, and need for services shall be conducted at least
every 12 months and at other times when there has been a significant change in the recipient's
functioning. Counties, case managers, and service providers are responsible for conducting these
reassessments and shall complete the reassessments out of existing funds.
   Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 256B.49, subdivision 15, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 15. Individualized service plan; comprehensive transitional service plan;
maintenance service plan. (a) Each recipient of home and community-based waivered services
shall be provided a copy of the written service plan which:
    (1) is developed and signed by the recipient within ten working days of the completion of the
assessment;
   (2) meets the assessed needs of the recipient;
   (3) reasonably ensures the health and safety of the recipient;
   (4) promotes independence;
   (5) allows for services to be provided in the most integrated settings; and
    (6) provides for an informed choice, as defined in section 256B.77, subdivision 2, paragraph (p),
of service and support providers.
    (b) In developing the comprehensive transitional service plan, the individual receiving services,
the case manager, and the guardian, if applicable, will identify the transitional service plan
fundamental service outcome and anticipated timeline to achieve this outcome. Within the first
20 days following a recipient's request for an assessment or reassessment, the transitional service
planning team must be identified. A team leader must be identified who will be responsible for
assigning responsibility and communicating with team members to ensure implementation of the
transition plan and ongoing assessment and communication process. The team leader should be an
individual, such as the case manager or guardian, who has the opportunity to follow the recipient
to the next level of service.
   Within ten days following an assessment, a comprehensive transitional service plan must
108TH DAY]                          TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 2012                                        6431

be developed incorporating elements of a comprehensive functional assessment and including
short-term measurable outcomes and timelines for achievement of and reporting on these outcomes.
Functional milestones must also be identified and reported according to the timelines agreed upon
by the transitional service planning team. In addition, the comprehensive transitional service plan
must identify additional supports that may assist in the achievement of the fundamental service
outcome such as the development of greater natural community support, increased collaboration
among agencies, and technological supports.
     The timelines for reporting on functional milestones will prompt a reassessment of services
provided, the units of services, rates, and appropriate service providers. It is the responsibility of
the transitional service planning team leader to review functional milestone reporting to determine
if the milestones are consistent with observable skills and that milestone achievement prompts any
needed changes to the comprehensive transitional service plan.
    For those whose fundamental transitional service outcome involves the need to procure housing,
a plan for the recipient to seek the resources necessary to secure the least restrictive housing possible
should be incorporated into the plan, including employment and public supports such as housing
access and shelter needy funding.
    (c) Counties and other agencies responsible for funding community placement and ongoing
community supportive services are responsible for the implementation of the comprehensive
transitional service plans. Oversight responsibilities include both ensuring effective transitional
service delivery and efficient utilization of funding resources.
    (d) Following one year of transitional services, the transitional services planning team will make
a determination as to whether or not the individual receiving services requires the current level of
continuous and consistent support in order to maintain the recipient's current level of functioning.
Recipients who are determined to have not had a significant change in functioning for 12 months
must move from a transitional to a maintenance service plan. Recipients on a maintenance service
plan must be reassessed to determine if the recipient would benefit from a transitional service plan at
least every 12 months and at other times when there has been a significant change in the recipient's
functioning. This assessment should consider any changes to technological or natural community
supports.
    (e) When a county is evaluating denials, reductions, or terminations of home and
community-based services under section 256B.49 for an individual, the case manager shall offer
to meet with the individual or the individual's guardian in order to discuss the prioritization of
service needs within the individualized service plan, comprehensive transitional service plan, or
maintenance service plan. The reduction in the authorized services for an individual due to changes
in funding for waivered services may not exceed the amount needed to ensure medically necessary
services to meet the individual's health, safety, and welfare.
    (f) At the time of reassessment, local agency case managers shall assess each recipient of
community alternatives for disabled individuals or traumatic brain injury waivered services
currently residing in a licensed adult foster home that is not the primary residence of the license
holder, or in which the license holder is not the primary caregiver, to determine if that recipient
could appropriately be served in a community-living setting. If appropriate for the recipient, the
case manager shall offer the recipient, through a person-centered planning process, the option
to receive alternative housing and service options. In the event that the recipient chooses to

   (2) individuals are not required to have a disability or specific diagnosis to live in the
community-living setting;
    (3) individuals may hire service providers of their choice;
    (4) individuals may choose whether to share their household and with whom;
    (5) the home or apartment must include living, sleeping, bathing, and cooking areas;
    (6) individuals must have lockable access and egress;
    (7) individuals must be free to receive visitors and leave the settings at times and for durations
of their own choosing;
    (8) leases must not reserve the right to assign units or change unit assignments; and
   (9) access to the greater community must be easily facilitated based on the individual's needs
and preferences.
  Sec. 37. [256B.492] HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SETTINGS FOR PEOPLE

   (2) a licensed adult foster care setting of up to five people; and
    (3) community living settings as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 256B.49, subdivision
23, where individuals with disabilities may reside in all of the units in a building of four or fewer
units, and no more than the greater of four or 25 percent of the units in a multifamily building of
more than four units.
   (b) The settings in paragraph (a) must not:
    (1) be located in a building that is a publicly or privately operated facility that provides
institutional treatment or custodial care;
   (2) be located in a building on the grounds of or adjacent to a public or private institution;
   (3) be a housing complex designed expressly around an individual's diagnosis or disability;
   (4) be segregated based on a disability, either physically or because of setting characteristics,
from the larger community; and
    (5) have the qualities of an institution which include, but are not limited to: regimented meal and
sleep times, limitations on visitors, and lack of privacy. Restrictions agreed to and documented in the
person's individual service plan shall not result in a residence having the qualities of an institution
as long as the restrictions for the person are not imposed upon others in the same residence and are
the least restrictive alternative, imposed for the shortest possible time to meet the person's needs.
    (c) The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) do not apply to any setting in which individuals
receive services under a home and community-based waiver as of the effective date of this section
and the setting does not meet the criteria of this section.
   (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (c), a program in Hennepin County established as part of a
Hennepin County demonstration project is qualified for the exception allowed under paragraph (c).
   (e) The commissioner shall submit an amendment to the waiver plan no later than December 31,
2012.
   Sec. 38. [256B.493] ADULT FOSTER CARE PLANNED CLOSURE.

solicit proposals for the conversion of services provided for persons with disabilities in settings
licensed under Minnesota Rules, parts 9555.5105 to 9555.6265, to other types of community
settings in conjunction with the closure of identified licensed adult foster care settings.
    Subd. 2. Planned closure process needs determination. The commissioner shall announce and
implement a program for planned closure of adult foster care homes. Planned closure shall be the
preferred method for achieving necessary budgetary savings required by the licensed bed closure
budget reduction in section 245A.03, subdivision 7, paragraph (e). If additional closures are required
to achieve the necessary savings, the commissioner shall use the process and priorities in section
245A.03, subdivision 7, paragraph (e).
    Subd. 3. Application process. (a) The commissioner shall establish a process for the application,
review, and approval of proposals from license holders for the closure of adult foster care settings.

    (b) When an application for a planned closure rate adjustment is submitted, the license holder
shall provide written notification within five working days to the lead agencies responsible for
authorizing the licensed services for the residents of the affected adult foster care settings. This
notification shall be deemed confidential until the license holder has received approval of the
application by the commissioner.
    Subd. 4. Review and approval process. (a) To be considered for approval, an application must
include:
   (1) a description of the proposed closure plan, which must identify the home or homes, and
occupied beds for which a planned closure rate adjustment is requested;
    (2) the proposed timetable for any proposed closure, including the proposed dates for notification
to residents and the affected lead agencies, commencement of closure, and completion of closure;
    (3) the proposed relocation plan jointly developed by the counties of financial responsibility,
the residents and their legal representatives, if any, who wish to continue to receive services from
the provider, and the providers for current residents of any adult foster care home designated for
closure; and
    (4) documentation in a format approved by the commissioner that all the adult foster care homes
receiving a planned closure rate adjustment under the plan have accepted joint and several liability
for recovery of overpayments under section 256B.0641, subdivision 2, for the facilities designated
for closure under this plan.
   (b) In reviewing and approving closure proposals, the commissioner shall give first priority to
proposals that:
   (1) target counties and geographic areas which have:
   (i) need for other types of services;
   (ii) need for specialized services;
    (iii) higher than average per capita use of foster care settings where the license holder does not
reside; or
   (iv) residents not living in the geographic area of their choice;
   (2) demonstrate savings of medical assistance expenditures; and
   (3) demonstrate that alternative services are based on the recipient's choice of provider and are
consistent with federal law, state law, and federally approved waiver plans.
    The commissioner shall also consider any information provided by service recipients, their legal
representatives, family members, or the lead agency on the impact of the planned closure on the
recipients and the services they need.
   (c) The commissioner shall select proposals that best meet the criteria established in this
subdivision for planned closure of adult foster care settings. The commissioner shall notify license
holders of the selections approved by the commissioner.
   (d) For each proposal approved by the commissioner, a contract must be established between

the commissioner, the counties of financial responsibility, and the participating license holder.
    Subd. 5. Notification of approved proposal. (a) Once the license holder receives notification
from the commissioner that the proposal has been approved, the license holder shall provide written
notification within five working days to:
    (1) the lead agencies responsible for authorizing the licensed services for the residents of the
affected adult foster care settings; and
   (2) current and prospective residents, any legal representatives, and family members involved.
   (b) This notification must occur at least 45 days prior to the implementation of the closure
proposal.
    Subd. 6. Adjustment to rates. (a) For purposes of this section, the commissioner shall establish
enhanced medical assistance payment rates under sections 256B.092 and 256B.49, to facilitate an
orderly transition for persons with disabilities from adult foster care to other community-based
settings.
    (b) The enhanced payment rate shall be effective the day after the first resident has moved until
the day the last resident has moved, not to exceed six months.
    Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 256B.5012, subdivision 13, is amended
to read:

Care Realignment Waiver application submitted under Laws 2011, First Special Session chapter 9,
article 7, section 52, or only receives approval to implement portions of the waiver request, for each
facility reimbursed under this section for services provided from July 1, 2013, through December 31,

                                         ญญ2 2013. The commissioner shall prorate the reduction in the
event that only portions of the waiver request are approved and after application of the continuing
care provider payment delay provision in article 6, section 2, subdivision 4, paragraph (f). For
each facility, the commissioner shall apply the rate reduction based on occupied beds, using the
percentage specified in this subdivision multiplied by the total payment rate, including the variable
rate but excluding the property-related payment rate, in effect on the preceding date. The total rate
reduction shall include the adjustment provided in section 256B.501, subdivision 12.
   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256D.44, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Special needs. In addition to the state standards of assistance established in subdivisions
1 to 4, payments are allowed for the following special needs of recipients of Minnesota supplemental
aid who are not residents of a nursing home, a regional treatment center, or a group residential
housing facility.
    (a) The county agency shall pay a monthly allowance for medically prescribed diets if the cost
of those additional dietary needs cannot be met through some other maintenance benefit. The need
for special diets or dietary items must be prescribed by a licensed physician. Costs for special diets
shall be determined as percentages of the allotment for a one-person household under the thrifty
food plan as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture. The types of diets and the

percentages of the thrifty food plan that are covered are as follows:
   (1) high protein diet, at least 80 grams daily, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (2) controlled protein diet, 40 to 60 grams and requires special products, 100 percent of thrifty
food plan;
    (3) controlled protein diet, less than 40 grams and requires special products, 125 percent of
thrifty food plan;
   (4) low cholesterol diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (5) high residue diet, 20 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (6) pregnancy and lactation diet, 35 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (7) gluten-free diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (8) lactose-free diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (9) antidumping diet, 15 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (10) hypoglycemic diet, 15 percent of thrifty food plan; or
   (11) ketogenic diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan.
    (b) Payment for nonrecurring special needs must be allowed for necessary home repairs or
necessary repairs or replacement of household furniture and appliances using the payment standard
of the AFDC program in effect on July 16, 1996, for these expenses, as long as other funding sources
are not available.
    (c) A fee for guardian or conservator service is allowed at a reasonable rate negotiated by the
county or approved by the court. This rate shall not exceed five percent of the assistance unit's gross
monthly income up to a maximum of $100 per month. If the guardian or conservator is a member
of the county agency staff, no fee is allowed.
    (d) The county agency shall continue to pay a monthly allowance of $68 for restaurant meals for
a person who was receiving a restaurant meal allowance on June 1, 1990, and who eats two or more
meals in a restaurant daily. The allowance must continue until the person has not received Minnesota
supplemental aid for one full calendar month or until the person's living arrangement changes and
the person no longer meets the criteria for the restaurant meal allowance, whichever occurs first.
    (e) A fee of ten percent of the recipient's gross income or $25, whichever is less, is allowed
for representative payee services provided by an agency that meets the requirements under SSI
regulations to charge a fee for representative payee services. This special need is available to all
recipients of Minnesota supplemental aid regardless of their living arrangement.
    (f)(1) Notwithstanding the language in this subdivision, an amount equal to the maximum
allotment authorized by the federal Food Stamp Program for a single individual which is in
effect on the first day of July of each year will be added to the standards of assistance established
in subdivisions 1 to 4 for adults under the age of 65 who qualify as shelter needy and are: (i)
relocating from an institution, or an adult mental health residential treatment program under section
256B.0622; (ii) eligible for the self-directed supports option as defined under section 256B.0657,

subdivision 2; or (iii) home and community-based waiver recipients living in their own home or
rented or leased apartment which is not owned, operated, or controlled by a provider of service not
related by blood or marriage, unless allowed under paragraph (g).
    (2) Notwithstanding subdivision 3, paragraph (c), an individual eligible for the shelter needy
benefit under this paragraph is considered a household of one. An eligible individual who receives
this benefit prior to age 65 may continue to receive the benefit after the age of 65.
    (3) "Shelter needy" means that the assistance unit incurs monthly shelter costs that exceed 40
percent of the assistance unit's gross income before the application of this special needs standard.
"Gross income" for the purposes of this section is the applicant's or recipient's income as defined
in section 256D.35, subdivision 10, or the standard specified in subdivision 3, paragraph (a) or (b),
whichever is greater. A recipient of a federal or state housing subsidy, that limits shelter costs to a
percentage of gross income, shall not be considered shelter needy for purposes of this paragraph.
     (g) Notwithstanding this subdivision, to access housing and services as provided in paragraph
(f), the recipient may choose housing that may be owned, operated, or controlled by the recipient's
service provider. In a multifamily building o       ญญfญfo
