The claimant may serve the complaint on the prosecuting authority by any means permitted by
court rules. If the value of the seized property is $15,000 or less, the claimant may file an action in
conciliation court for recovery of the seized property. If the value of the seized property is less than
$500, the claimant does not have to pay the conciliation court filing fee. No responsive pleading

by the claimant. If a related criminal proceeding is pending, the hearing shall not be held until the
conclusion of the criminal proceedings. The district court administrator shall schedule the hearing
as soon as practicable after adjudication in the criminal prosecution. The proceedings are governed
by the Rules of Civil Procedure.
   (b) The complaint must be captioned in the name of the claimant as plaintiff and the seized
property as defendant, and must state with specificity the grounds on which the claimant alleges the
property was improperly seized and the plaintiff's interest in the property seized. Notwithstanding
any law to the contrary, an action for the return of property seized under this section may not be
maintained by or on behalf of any person who has been served with a notice of seizure and forfeiture
unless the person has complied with this subdivision.
    (c) If the claimant makes a timely demand for judicial determination under this subdivision,
the appropriate agency must conduct the forfeiture under section 609.531, subdivision 6a.
The limitations and defenses set forth in section 609.5311, subdivision 3, apply to the judicial
determination.
    (d) If a demand for judicial determination of an administrative forfeiture is filed under this
subdivision and the court orders the return of the seized property, the court shall order that filing
fees be reimbursed to the person who filed the demand. In addition, the court may order sanctions
under section 549.211. If the court orders payment of these costs, they must be paid from forfeited
money or proceeds from the sale of forfeited property from the appropriate law enforcement and
prosecuting agencies in the same proportion as they would be distributed under section 609.5315,
subdivision 5."

    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 524.2-1106, is amended to read:
    524.2-1106 WHEN DISCLAIMER IS BARRED OR LIMITED.
    (a) A disclaimer is barred by a written waiver of the right to disclaim.
    (b) A disclaimer of an interest in property is barred if any of the following events occur before
the disclaimer becomes effective:

   (1) the disclaimant accepts the portion of the interest sought to be disclaimed;
    (2) the disclaimant voluntarily assigns, conveys, encumbers, pledges, or transfers the portion of
the interest sought to be disclaimed or contracts to do so;
   (3) the portion of the interest sought to be disclaimed is sold pursuant to a judicial sale; or
   (4) the disclaimant is insolvent when the disclaimer becomes irrevocable.
    (c) Acceptance of a distribution from a trust shall constitute acceptance of only that portion of
the beneficial interest in that trust that has been distributed, and shall not constitute acceptance or
bar disclaimer of that portion of the beneficial interest in the trust that has not yet been distributed.
    (d) A disclaimer, in whole or in part, of the future exercise of a power held in a fiduciary capacity
is not barred by its previous exercise.
   ­(d
     ­­) (e) A disclaimer, in whole or in part, of the future exercise of a power not held in a fiduciary

   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 524.2-1107, is amended to read:
  524.2-1107 POWER             TO    DISCLAIM;         GENERAL         REQUIREMENTS;            WHEN
IRREVOCABLE.
    (a) A person may disclaim, in whole or in part, any interest in or power over property, including
a power of appointment. A person may disclaim the interest or power even if its creator imposed
a spendthrift provision or similar restriction on transfer or a restriction or limitation on the right to
disclaim.
    (b) With court approval, a fiduciary may disclaim, in whole or in part, any interest in or power
over property, including a power of appointment when acting in a representative capacity. Without
court approval, a fiduciary may disclaim, in whole or in part, any interest in or power over property,
including a power of appointment, if and to the extent that the instrument creating the fiduciary
relationship explicitly grants the fiduciary the right to disclaim. With court approval, a custodial
parent may disclaim on behalf of a minor child for whom no conservator has been appointed, in
whole or in part, any interest in or power over property, including a power of appointment, which
the minor child is to receive.
    (c) To be effective, a disclaimer must be in writing, declare the writing as a disclaimer, describe
the interest or power disclaimed, and be signed by the person or fiduciary making the disclaimer
and acknowledged in the manner provided for deeds of real estate to be recorded in this state. In
addition, for a disclaimer to be effective, an original of the disclaimer must be delivered or filed in
the manner provided in section 524.2-1114.
   (d) A partial disclaimer may be expressed as a fraction, percentage, monetary amount, specific
property, term of years, portion of a beneficial interest in or right to distributions from a trust,
limitation of a power, or any other interest or estate in the property.

   (e) A disclaimer becomes irrevocable when the disclaimer is delivered or filed pursuant to section
524.2-1114 or it becomes effective as provided in sections 524.2-1108 to 524.2-1113, whichever
occurs later.
    (f) A disclaimer made under sections 524.2-1101 to 524.2-1116 is not a transfer, assignment, or
release.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 524.2-1114, is amended to read:
   524.2-1114 DELIVERY OR FILING.
     (a) Subject to paragraphs (b) to (l), delivery of a disclaimer may be effective by personal delivery,
first-class mail, or any other method that results in its receipt. A disclaimer sent by first-class mail
is deemed to have been delivered on the date it is postmarked. Delivery by any other method is
effective upon receipt by the person to whom the disclaimer is to be delivered under this section.
    (b) In the case of a disclaimer of an interest created under the law of intestate succession or an
interest created by will, other than an interest in a testamentary trust:
   (1) the disclaimer must be delivered to the personal representative of the decedent's estate; or
    (2) if no personal representative is serving when the disclaimer is sought to be delivered, the
disclaimer must be filed with the clerk of the court in any county where venue of administration
would be proper.
   (c) In the case of a disclaimer of an interest in a testamentary trust:
    (1) the disclaimer must be delivered to the trustee serving when the disclaimer is delivered or,
if no trustee is then serving, to the personal representative of the decedent's estate; or
    (2) if no personal representative is serving when the disclaimer is sought to be delivered, the
disclaimer must be filed with the clerk of the court in any county where venue of administration of
the decedent's estate would be proper.
   (d) In the case of a disclaimer of an interest in an inter vivos trust:
   (1) the disclaimer must be delivered to the trustee serving when the disclaimer is delivered;
    (2) if no trustee is then serving, it must be filed with the clerk of the court in any county where
the filing of a notice of trust would be proper; or
    (3) if the disclaimer is made before the time the instrument creating the trust becomes
irrevocable, the disclaimer must be delivered to the person with the power to revoke the revocable
trust or the transferor of the interest or to such person's legal representative.
    (e) In the case of a disclaimer of an interest created by a beneficiary designation made before the
time the designation becomes irrevocable, the disclaimer must be delivered to the person making
the beneficiary designation or to such person's legal representative.
    (f) In the case of a disclaimer of an interest created by a beneficiary designation made after the
time the designation becomes irrevocable, the disclaimer must be delivered to the person obligated
to distribute the interest.

     (g) In the case of a disclaimer by a surviving holder of jointly held property, the disclaimer
must be delivered to the person to whom the disclaimed interest passes or, if such person cannot
reasonably be located by the disclaimant, the disclaimer must be delivered as provided in paragraph
(b).
   (h) In the case of a disclaimer by an object, or taker in default of exercise, of a power of
appointment at any time after the power was created, the disclaimer must be delivered to:
   (1) the holder of the power; or
    (2) the fiduciary acting under the instrument that created the power or, if no fiduciary is serving
when the disclaimer is sought to be delivered, filed with a court having authority to appoint the
fiduciary.
    (i) In the case of a disclaimer by an appointee of a nonfiduciary power of appointment, the
disclaimer must be delivered to:
   (1) the holder of the power or the personal representative of the holder's estate; or
    (2) the fiduciary under the instrument that created the power or, if no fiduciary is serving when
the disclaimer is sought to be delivered, filed with a court having authority to appoint the fiduciary.
   (j) In the case of a disclaimer by a fiduciary of a power over a trust or estate, the disclaimer must
be delivered as provided in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) as if the power disclaimed were an interest in
property.
    (k) In the case of a disclaimer of a power exercisable by an agent, other than a power exercisable
by a fiduciary over a trust or estate, the disclaimer must be delivered to the principal or the principal's
representative.
