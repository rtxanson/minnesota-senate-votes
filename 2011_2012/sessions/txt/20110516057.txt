a physically disabled person:

    (2) in a metered parking space without obligation to pay the meter fee and without time
restrictions unless time restrictions are separately posted on official signs; and

passenger vehicles but restricted to a maximum period of time and that does not specifically prohibit

mirror attached to the front windshield of the motor vehicle or, in the case of a motorcycle, is secured

the certificate on the mirror, the certificate must be displayed on the dashboard on the driver's side
of the vehicle. No part of the certificate may be obscured.

that publicly owned property acquired under this chapter has not been used and is no longer needed
for a public use, the authority must offer to sell the property to the owner from whom it was
acquired, if the former owner can be located. The offer must be at the original price determined
by the condemnation process or the current fair market value of the property, whichever is lower,
except to the extent that a different value is required for a property interest obtained with federal
highway funding under United States Code, title 23, or transit funding under United States Code,

property to the former owner as provided in this section.

the property, the attorney for the condemning authority shall prepare a certificate attesting to the
same and record the certificate in the office of the county recorder or county registrar of titles, as
appropriate, to evidence the termination of the right of first refusal. A recorded certificate to that
