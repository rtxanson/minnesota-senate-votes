    (a) "Tip or gratuity" means a sum presented by a customer in recognition of a service performed.

    (2) any amount turned over to or credited to the employer to be treated by the employer as part
of the employer's gross receipts; or

    (3) a compulsory charge for service, including a fixed percentage of the total amount of the
bill, imposed on a customer unless the total amount of the compulsory charge is distributed by the
employer to the employee.
    (b) When tips or gratuities are received by the employee, the employer may pay an amount less
than the applicable minimum wage under subdivision 1, only if the employer can establish by its
payroll records that for each payroll period during which the employer pays an employee an amount
less than the minimum wage, that after adding the tips received to the wages paid, no less than the
minimum wage under subdivision 1 was received by the employee. However, in no case can an
employer pay less than 50 percent of the applicable minimum wage under subdivision 1.
    (c) When an employer pays an amount under paragraph (b) that is less than the minimum wage,
the employer must:
   (1) have a tip declaration signed by the employee each pay period; and
   (2) show on the payroll records that required Social Security or other taxes have been withheld
each pay period which demonstrate that when adding tips received to the wages paid by the
employer, an amount no less than the minimum wage under subdivision 1 was received by the
employee.
   If the employer's payroll records do not contain the required information, the employer shall not
pay an amount less than the minimum wage.
    (d) Under a pooling arrangement whereby the employer redistributes tips to employees based
upon a system developed by and to which the employees have mutually agreed among themselves,
only the amounts received and retained by each individual employee are counted as the employee's
tips.
    (e) This subdivision applies only when an employee receives tips or gratuities in excess of $50
per month.""

   The chair ruled that the amendment was not germane.
