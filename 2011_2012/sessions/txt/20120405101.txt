If a license is issued during this moratorium, and the license holder changes the license holder's
primary residence away from the physical location of the foster care license, the commissioner shall

   (1) foster care settings that are required to be registered under chapter 144D;
    (2) foster care licenses replacing foster care licenses in existence on May 15, 2009, and
determined to be needed by the commissioner under paragraph (b);

    (4) new foster care licenses determined to be needed by the commissioner under paragraph (b)
for persons requiring hospital level care; or
   (5) new foster care licenses determined to be needed by the commissioner for the transition of
people from personal care assistance to the home and community-based services.
    (b) The commissioner shall determine the need for newly licensed foster care homes as defined
under this subdivision. As part of the determination, the commissioner shall consider the availability
of foster care capacity in the area in which the licensee seeks to operate, and the recommendation
of the local county board. The determination by the commissioner must be final. A determination
of need is not required for a change in ownership at the same address.
    (c) Residential settings that would otherwise be subject to the moratorium established in
paragraph (a), that are in the process of receiving an adult or child foster care license as of July
1, 2009, shall be allowed to continue to complete the process of receiving an adult or child foster
care license. For this paragraph, all of the following conditions must be met to be considered in the
process of receiving an adult or child foster care license:
   (1) participants have made decisions to move into the residential setting, including
documentation in each participant's care plan;
   (2) the provider has purchased housing or has made a financial investment in the property;

individual;
   (4) the completion of the licensing process, including all necessary inspections, is the only
remaining component prior to being able to provide services; and
   (5) the needs of the individuals cannot be met within the existing capacity in that county.
To qualify for the process under this paragraph, the lead agency must submit documentation to the
commissioner by August 1, 2009, that all of the above criteria are met.
   (d) The commissioner shall study the effects of the license moratorium under this subdivision
and shall report back to the legislature by January 15, 2011. This study shall include, but is not
limited to the following:
   (1) the overall capacity and utilization of foster care beds where the physical location is not the

primary residence of the license holder prior to and after implementation of the moratorium; and
   (3) the number of licensed and occupied ICF/MR beds prior to and after implementation of the
moratorium.
    (e) When a foster care recipient moves out of a foster home that is not the primary residence

immediately inform the Department of Human Services Licensing Division, and the department
shall immediately decrease the statewide licensed capacity for ญh  tญญ

where the physical location is not the primary residence of the license holder. A decreased
licensed capacity according to this paragraph is not subject to appeal under this chapter. A needs
determination process, managed at the state level, with county input, will determine where the
reduced capacity will occur.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 256B.49, subdivision 15, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 15. Individualized service plan; comprehensive transitional service plan;
maintenance service plan. (a) Each recipient of home and community-based waivered services
shall be provided a copy of the written service plan which:
    (1) is developed and signed by the recipient within ten working days of the completion of the
assessment;
      (2) meets the assessed needs of the recipient;
      (3) reasonably ensures the health and safety of the recipient;
      (4) promotes independence;

   (5) allows for services to be provided in the most integrated settings; and
    (6) provides for an informed choice, as defined in section 256B.77, subdivision 2, paragraph (p),
of service and support providers.
    (b) In developing the comprehensive transitional service plan, the individual receiving services,
the case manager, and the guardian, if applicable, will identify the transitional service plan
fundamental service outcome and anticipated timeline to achieve this outcome. Within the first
20 days following a recipient's request for an assessment or reassessment, the transitional service
planning team must be identified. A team leader must be identified who will be responsible for
assigning responsibility and communicating with team members to ensure implementation of the
transition plan and ongoing assessment and communication process. The team leader should be an
individual, such as the case manager or guardian, who has the opportunity to follow the recipient
to the next level of service.
    Within ten days following an assessment, a comprehensive transitional service plan must
be developed incorporating elements of a comprehensive functional assessment and including
short-term measurable outcomes and timelines for achievement of and reporting on these outcomes.
Functional milestones must also be identified and reported according to the timelines agreed upon
by the transitional service planning team. In addition, the comprehensive transitional service plan
must identify additional supports that may assist in the achievement of the fundamental service
outcome such as the development of greater natural community support, increased collaboration
among agencies, and technological supports.
     The timelines for reporting on functional milestones will prompt a reassessment of services
provided, the units of services, rates, and appropriate service providers. It is the responsibility of
the transitional service planning team leader to review functional milestone reporting to determine
if the milestones are consistent with observable skills and that milestone achievement prompts any
needed changes to the comprehensive transitional service plan.
    For those whose fundamental transitional service outcome involves the need to procure housing,
a plan for the recipient to seek the resources necessary to secure the least restrictive housing possible
should be incorporated into the plan, including employment and public supports such as housing
access and shelter needy funding.
    (c) Counties and other agencies responsible for funding community placement and ongoing
community supportive services are responsible for the implementation of the comprehensive
transitional service plans. Oversight responsibilities include both ensuring effective transitional
service delivery and efficient utilization of funding resources.
    (d) Following one year of transitional services, the transitional services planning team will make
a determination as to whether or not the individual receiving services requires the current level of
continuous and consistent support in order to maintain the recipient's current level of functioning.
Recipients who are determined to have not had a significant change in functioning for 12 months
must move from a transitional to a maintenance service plan. Recipients on a maintenance service
plan must be reassessed to determine if the recipient would benefit from a transitional service plan at
least every 12 months and at other times when there has been a significant change in the recipient's
functioning. This assessment should consider any changes to technological or natural community
supports.

    (e) When a county is evaluating denials, reductions, or terminations of home and
community-based services under section 256B.49 for an individual, the case manager shall offer
to meet with the individual or the individual's guardian in order to discuss the prioritization of
service needs within the individualized service plan, comprehensive transitional service plan, or
maintenance service plan. The reduction in the authorized services for an individual due to changes
in funding for waivered services may not exceed the amount needed to ensure medically necessary
services to meet the individual's health, safety, and welfare.
    (f) At the time of reassessment, local agency case managers shall assess each recipient of
community alternatives for disabled individuals or traumatic brain injury waivered services
currently residing in a licensed adult foster home that is not the primary residence of the license
holder, or in which the license holder is not the primary caregiver, to determine if that recipient
could appropriately be served in a community-living setting. If appropriate for the recipient, the
case manager shall offer the recipient, through a person-centered planning process, the option to
receive alternative housing and service options. In the event that the recipient chooses to transfer
from the adult foster home, the vacated bed shall not be filled with another recipient of waiver
services and group residential housing, unless provided under section 245A.03, subdivision 7,
paragraph (a), clauses (3) and (4), and the statewide licensed capacity shall be reduced accordingly.
If the adult foster home becomes no longer viable due to these transfers, the county agency,
with the assistance of the department, shall facilitate a consolidation of settings or closure. This
reassessment process shall be completed by June 30, 2     ญญ

that puts the child or other person at risk of injury.
A mental health behavioral aide must document the delivery of services in written progress notes.
The mental health behavioral aide must implement treatment strategies in the individual treatment
plan and the individual behavior plan. The mental health behavioral aide must document the
delivery of services in written progress notes. Progress notes must reflect implementation of the

to the treatment strategies; and
   (5) direction of a mental health behavioral aide must include the following:
   (i) a clinical supervision plan approved by the responsible mental health professional;
    (ii) ongoing on-site observation by a mental health professional or mental health practitioner for
at least a total of one hour during every 40 hours of service provided to a child; and

to read:
    Subd. 3e. Customized living service rate. (a) Payment for customized living services shall be a
monthly rate authorized by the lead agency within the parameters established by the commissioner.
The payment agreement must delineate the amount of each component service included in the
recipient's customized living service plan. The lead agency, with input from the provider of
customized living services, shall ensure that there is a documented need within the parameters
established by the commissioner for all component customized living services authorized.
   (b) The payment rate must be based on the amount of component services to be provided utilizing
component rates established by the commissioner. Counties and tribes shall use tools issued by the
commissioner to develop and document customized living service plans and rates.
    (c) Component service rates must not exceed payment rates for comparable elderly waiver or
medical assistance services and must reflect economies of scale. Customized living services must
not include rent or raw food costs.
    (d) With the exception of individuals described in subdivision 3a, paragraph (b), the
individualized monthly authorized payment for the customized living service plan shall not exceed
50 percent of the greater of either the statewide or any of the geographic groups' weighted average
monthly nursing facility rate of the case mix resident class to which the elderly waiver eligible client
would be assigned under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, less the maintenance
needs allowance as described in subdivision 1d, paragraph (a), until the July 1 of the state fiscal
year in which the resident assessment system as described in section 256B.438 for nursing home
rate determination is implemented. Effective on July 1 of the state fiscal year in which the resident
assessment system as described in section 256B.438 for nursing home rate determination is
implemented and July 1 of each subsequent state fiscal year, the individualized monthly authorized
payment for the services described in this clause shall not exceed the limit which was in effect on
June 30 of the previous state fiscal year updated annually based on legislatively adopted changes
to all service rate maximums for home and community-based service providers.
   (e) Effective July 1, 2011, the individualized monthly payment for the customized living service
plan for individuals described in subdivision 3a, paragraph (b), must be the monthly authorized
payment limit for customized living for individuals classified as case mix A, reduced by 25 percent.
This rate limit must be applied to all new participants enrolled in the program on or after July 1,
2011, who meet the criteria described in subdivision 3a, paragraph (b). This monthly limit also

applies to all other participants who meet the criteria described in subdivision 3a, paragraph (b), at
reassessment.
    (f) Customized living services are delivered by a provider licensed by the Department of Health
as a class A or class F home care provider and provided in a building that is registered as a housing
with services establishment under chapter 144D. Licensed home care providers are subject to section
256B.0651, subdivision 14.
    (g) A provider may not bill or otherwise charge an elderly waiver participant or their family
for additional units of any allowable component service beyond those available under the service
rate limits described in paragraph (d), nor for additional units of any allowable component service
beyond those approved in the service plan by the lead agency.
    Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 256B.0915, subdivision 3h, is amended
to read:
    Subd. 3h. Service rate limits; 24-hour customized living services. (a) The payment rate for
24-hour customized living services is a monthly rate authorized by the lead agency within the
parameters established by the commissioner of human services. The payment agreement must
delineate the amount of each component service included in each recipient's customized living
service plan. The lead agency, with input from the provider of customized living services, shall
ensure that there is a documented need within the parameters established by the commissioner for
all component customized living services authorized. The lead agency shall not authorize 24-hour
customized living services unless there is a documented need for 24-hour supervision.
    (b) For purposes of this section, "24-hour supervision" means that the recipient requires
assistance due to needs related to one or more of the following:
   (1) intermittent assistance with toileting, positioning, or transferring;
   (2) cognitive or behavioral issues;
   (3) a medical condition that requires clinical monitoring; or
    (4) for all new participants enrolled in the program on or after July 1, 2011, and all other
participants at their first reassessment after July 1, 2011, dependency in at least three of the
following activities of daily living as determined by assessment under section 256B.0911: bathing;
dressing; grooming; walking; or eating when the dependency score in eating is three or greater;
and needs medication management and at least 50 hours of service per month. The lead agency
shall ensure that the frequency and mode of supervision of the recipient and the qualifications of
staff providing supervision are described and meet the needs of the recipient.
    (c) The payment rate for 24-hour customized living services must be based on the amount of
component services to be provided utilizing component rates established by the commissioner.
Counties and tribes will use tools issued by the commissioner to develop and document customized
living plans and authorize rates.
  (d) Component service rates must not exceed payment rates for comparable elderly waiver or
medical assistance services and must reflect economies of scale.
   (e) The individually authorized 24-hour customized living payments, in combination with

the payment for other elderly waiver services, including case management, must not exceed the
recipient's community budget cap specified in subdivision 3a. Customized living services must not
include rent or raw food costs.
    (f) The individually authorized 24-hour customized living payment rates shall not exceed
the 95 percentile of statewide monthly authorizations for 24-hour customized living services in
effect and in the Medicaid management information systems on March 31, 2009, for each case
mix resident class under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, to which elderly waiver
service clients are assigned. When there are fewer than 50 authorizations in effect in the case mix
resident class, the commissioner shall multiply the calculated service payment rate maximum for
the A classification by the standard weight for that classification under Minnesota Rules, parts
9549.0050 to 9549.0059, to determine the applicable payment rate maximum. Service payment
rate maximums shall be updated annually based on legislatively adopted changes to all service
rates for home and community-based service providers.
    (g) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (f), the commissioner may establish
alternative payment rate systems for 24-hour customized living services in housing with services
establishments which are freestanding buildings with a capacity of 16 or fewer, by applying a single
hourly rate for covered component services provided in either:
   (1) licensed corporate adult foster homes; or
   (2) specialized dementia care units which meet the requirements of section 144D.065 and in
which:
   (i) each resident is offered the option of having their own apartment; or
    (ii) the units are licensed as board and lodge establishments with maximum capacity of eight
residents, and which meet the requirements of Minnesota Rules, part 9555.6205, subparts 1, 2, 3,
and 4, item A.
    (h) A provider may not bill or otherwise charge an elderly waiver participant or their family
for additional units of any allowable component service beyond those available under the service
rate limits described in paragraph (e), nor for additional units of any allowable component service
beyond those approved in the service plan by the lead agency."

Any excess shall first reduce the amounts specified under paragraph (a), clauses (2) to (4). Any
excess following this reduction shall proportionally reduce the amount specified under paragraph
(a), clause (1).
   (c) Beginning September 1, 2011, of the amount in paragraph (a), the commissioner shall transfer
