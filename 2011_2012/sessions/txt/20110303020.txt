teacher candidates in three areas: planning for instruction and assessment; engaging students and
supporting learning; and assessing student learning.

of reading development, the development of reading comprehension, and reading assessment and
instruction, and their ability to integrate that knowledge and understanding.

secondary school teachers in elementary or secondary schools to obtain periodic exposure to the
elementary or secondary teaching environment.

   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.16, is amended to read:
   122A.16 HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHER DEFINED.
    (a) A qualified teacher is one holding a valid license, under this chapter, to perform the particular
service for which the teacher is employed in a public school.
    (b) For the purposes of the federal No Child Left Behind Act, a highly qualified teacher is
one who holds a valid license under this chapter, including under section 122A.245, among other
sections, to perform the particular service for which the teacher is employed in a public school or
who meets the requirements of a highly objective uniform state standard of evaluation (HOUSSE).
   All Minnesota teachers teaching in a core academic subject area, as defined by the federal No
Child Left Behind Act, in which they are not fully licensed may complete the following HOUSSE
process in the core subject area for which the teacher is requesting highly qualified status by
completing an application, in the form and manner described by the commissioner, that includes:
   (1) documentation of student achievement as evidenced by norm-referenced test results that are
objective and psychometrically valid and reliable;
   (2) evidence of local, state, or national activities, recognition, or awards for professional
contribution to achievement;
   (3) description of teaching experience in the teachers' core subject area in a public school
336                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [20TH DAY

under a waiver, variance, limited license or other exception; nonpublic school; and postsecondary
institution;
   (4) test results from the Praxis II content test;
   (5) evidence of advanced certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching
Standards;
   (6) evidence of the successful completion of course work or pedagogy courses; and
   (7) evidence of the successful completion of high quality professional development activities.
    Districts must assign a school administrator to serve as a HOUSSE reviewer to meet with
teachers under this paragraph and, where appropriate, certify the teachers' applications. Teachers
satisfy the definition of highly qualified when the teachers receive at least 100 of the total number
of points used to measure the teachers' content expertise under clauses (1) to (7). Teachers may
acquire up to 50 points only in any one clause (1) to (7). Teachers may use the HOUSSE process
to satisfy the definition of highly qualified for more than one subject area.
   (c) Achievement of the HOUSSE criteria is not equivalent to a license. A teacher must obtain
permission from the Board of Teaching in order to teach in a public school.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.23, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Preparation equivalency. When a license to teach is authorized to be issued
to any holder of a diploma or a degree of a Minnesota state university, or of the University of
Minnesota, or of a liberal arts university, or a technical training institution, such license may
also, in the discretion of the Board of Teaching or the commissioner of education, whichever has
jurisdiction, be issued to any holder of a diploma or a degree of a teacher training institution of
equivalent rank and standing of any other state. The diploma or degree must be granted by virtue
   t­­
of ­h e­­
        co
         ­m p­e
           ­­ l­­i

                  ­­n­o
                      ­­f completing a course in teacher preparation essentially equivalent in content
to that required by such Minnesota state university or the University of Minnesota or a liberal
arts university in Minnesota or a technical training institution as preliminary to the granting of a
diploma or a degree of the same rank and class. For purposes of granting a Minnesota teaching
license to a person who receives a diploma or degree from a state-accredited, out-of-state teacher
training program leading to licensure, the Board of Teaching must establish criteria and streamlined
procedures to recognize the experience and professional credentials of the person holding the
out-of-state diploma or degree and allow that person to demonstrate to the board the person's
qualifications for receiving a Minnesota teaching license based on performance measures the board
adopts under this section.
  Sec. 4. [122A.245] ALTERNATIVE TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM AND
LIMITED-TERM TEACHER LICENSE.
   Subdivision 1. Requirements. (a) To improve academic excellence, improve ethnic and cultural
diversity in the classroom, and close the academic achievement gap, the Board of Teaching must
approve qualified teacher preparation programs under this section that are a means to acquire a
two-year limited-term license, which the board may renew one time for an additional one-year term,
and to prepare for acquiring a standard license. The following entities are eligible to participate
under this section:
20TH DAY]                        THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2011                                         337

orientation, professional staff development, and mentoring and peer review focused on standards
of professional practice and continuous professional growth; and
    (6) a requirement that teacher candidates demonstrate to the local site team under subdivision 5
satisfactory progress toward acquiring a standard license from the Board of Teaching.
    Subd. 3. Program approval; disapproval. (a) The Board of Teaching must approve alternative
teacher preparation programs under this section based on board-adopted criteria that reflect best
practices for alternative teacher preparation programs, consistent with this section. The board
must permit teacher candidates to demonstrate mastery of pedagogy and content standards in
school-based settings and through other nontraditional means.

notifies the program provider of any deficiencies and gives the program provider an opportunity to
remedy the deficiencies.
    Subd. 4. Employment conditions. Where applicable, teacher candidates with a limited-term
license under this section are members of the local employee organization representing teachers
and subject to the terms of the local collective bargaining agreement between the exclusive
representative of the teachers and the school board. A collective bargaining agreement between
a school board and the exclusive representative of the teachers must not prevent or restrict or
otherwise interfere with a school district's ability to employ a teacher prepared under this section.
    Subd. 5. Approval for standard license. A school board or its designee must appoint members
to a local site team that includes teachers, school administrators, and postsecondary faculty under

The evaluation must be consistent with board-adopted performance measures, use the Minnesota
state standards of effective practice and subject matter content standards for teachers established
in Minnesota Rules, and include a report to the board recommending whether or not to issue the
teacher candidate a standard license.
    Subd. 6. Applicants trained in other states. A person who successfully completes another
state's alternative teacher preparation program, consistent with section 122A.23, subdivision 1, may
apply to the Board of Teaching for a standard license under subdivision 7.
    Subd. 7. Standard license. The Board of Teaching must issue a standard license to an
otherwise qualified teacher candidate under this section who successfully performs throughout a
program under this section, successfully completes all required skills, pedagogy, and content area
examinations under section 122A.09, subdivision 4, paragraphs (a) and (e), and is recommended
for licensure under subdivision 5 or successfully demonstrates to the board qualifications for
licensure under subdivision 6.

section is a highly qualified teacher and the teacher of record under section 122A.16.
    Subd. 9. Exchange of best practices. By July 31 in an even-numbered year, a program
participant and the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, the University of Minnesota, the

about best practices and educational innovations.
    Subd. 10. Reports. The Board of Teaching must submit an interim report on the efficacy of this

under section 168(k)" for the taxable year is limited to excess of the depreciation claimed by the

    (e) For a nonresident or part-year resident, the credit must be allocated based on the percentage
calculated under section 290.06, subdivision 2c, paragraph (e).
    (f) For a person who was a resident for the entire tax year and has earned income not subject
to tax under this chapter, including income excluded under section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clause
(9) or (15), the credit must be allocated based on the ratio of federal adjusted gross income reduced
by the earned income not subject to tax under this chapter over federal adjusted gross income. For
purposes of this paragraph, the subtractions for military pay under section 290.01, subdivision 19b,
clauses (10) and (11), are not considered "earned income not subject to tax under this chapter."
   For the purposes of this paragraph, the exclusion of combat pay under section 112 of the Internal
Revenue Code is not considered "earned income not subject to tax under this chapter."
    (g) For tax years beginning after December 31, 2007, and before December 31, 2010, the
$5,770 in paragraph (b), the $15,080 in paragraph (c), and the $17,890 in paragraph (d), after being
adjusted for inflation under subdivision 7, are each increased by $3,000 for married taxpayers filing
joint returns. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2008, and before December 31, 2010,
the commissioner shall annually adjust the $3,000 by the percentage determined pursuant to the
provisions of section 1(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, except that in section 1(f)(3)(B), the word
"2007" shall be substituted for the word "1992." For 2009, the commissioner shall then determine
the percent change from the 12 months ending on August 31, 2007, to the 12 months ending on
August 31, 2008, and in each subsequent year, from the 12 months ending on August 31, 2007,
to the 12 months ending on August 31 of the year preceding the taxable year. The earned income
thresholds as adjusted for inflation must be rounded to the nearest $10. If the amount ends in $5,
the amount is rounded up to the nearest $10. The determination of the commissioner under this
subdivision is not a rule under the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (h) For tax years beginning after December 31, 2010, and before December 31, 2012, the $5,770
in paragraph (b), the $15,080 in paragraph (c), and the $17,890 in paragraph (d), after being adjusted
for inflation under subdivision 7, are each increased by $5,080 for married taxpayers filing joint
returns. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2011, and before December 31, 2012, the
commissioner shall adjust the $5,080 by the percentage determined pursuant to the provisions of

   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290.06, subdivision 22, is amended to read:
   Subd. 22. Credit for taxes paid to another state. (a) A taxpayer who is liable for taxes based
on net income to another state, as provided in paragraphs (b) through (f), upon income allocated or
apportioned to Minnesota, is entitled to a credit for the tax paid to another state if the tax is actually
paid in the taxable year or a subsequent taxable year. A taxpayer who is a resident or part-year

resident of this state pursuant to section 290.01, subdivision 7, paragraph (b), and who is subject to
income tax as a resident in the state of the individual's domicile is not allowed this credit unless the
state of domicile does not allow a similar credit.
    (b) For an individual, estate, or trust, the credit is determined by multiplying the tax payable
under this chapter by the ratio derived by dividing the income subject to tax in the other state that is
also subject to tax in Minnesota while a resident of Minnesota by the taxpayer's federal adjusted
gross income, as defined in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code, modified by the addition
required by section 290.01, subdivision 19a, clause (1), and the subtraction allowed by section
290.01, subdivision 19b, clause (1), to the extent the income is allocated or assigned to Minnesota
under sections 290.081 and 290.17.
    (c) If the taxpayer is an athletic team that apportions all of its income under section 290.17,
subdivision 5, the credit is determined by multiplying the tax payable under this chapter by the
ratio derived from dividing the total net income subject to tax in the other state by the taxpayer's
Minnesota taxable income.
    (d) The credit determined under paragraph (b) or (c) shall not exceed the amount of tax so paid
to the other state on the gross income earned within the other state subject to tax under this chapter,
nor shall the allowance of the credit reduce the taxes paid under this chapter to an amount less than
what would be assessed if such income amount was excluded from taxable net income.
    (e) In the case of the tax assessed on a lump-sum distribution under section 290.032, the credit
allowed under paragraph (a) is the tax assessed by the other state on the lump-sum distribution that
is also subject to tax under section 290.032, and shall not exceed the tax assessed under section
290.032. To the extent the total lump-sum distribution defined in section 290.032, subdivision 1,
includes lump-sum distributions received in prior years or is all or in part an annuity contract, the
reduction to the tax on the lump-sum distribution allowed under section 290.032, subdivision 2,
includes tax paid to another state that is properly apportioned to that distribution.
    (f) If a Minnesota resident reported an item of income to Minnesota and is assessed tax in such
other state on that same income after the Minnesota statute of limitations has expired, the taxpayer
shall receive a credit for that year under paragraph (a), notwithstanding any statute of limitations to
the contrary. The claim for the credit must be submitted within one year from the date the taxes were
paid to the other state. The taxpayer must submit sufficient proof to show entitlement to a credit.
    (g) For the purposes of this subdivision, a resident shareholder of a corporation treated as an
"S" corporation under section 290.9725, must be considered to have paid a tax imposed on the
shareholder in an amount equal to the shareholder's pro rata share of any net income tax paid by
the S corporation to another state. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "net income
tax" means any tax imposed on or measured by a corporation's net income.
    (h) For the purposes of this subdivision, a resident partner of an entity taxed as a partnership
under the Internal Revenue Code must be considered to have paid a tax imposed on the partner in an
amount equal to the partner's pro rata share of any net income tax paid by the partnership to another
state. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "net income" tax means any tax imposed on
or measured by a partnership's net income.
   (i) For the purposes of this subdivision, "another state":

   (1) includes:
   (i) the District of Columbia; and
   (ii) a province or territory of Canada; but
   (2) excludes Puerto Rico and the several territories organized by Congress.
   (j) The limitations on the credit in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), are imposed on a state by state
basis.
    (k) For a tax imposed by a province or territory of Canada, the tax for purposes of this subdivision
is the excess of the tax over the amount of the foreign tax credit allowed under section 27 of the
Internal Revenue Code. In determining the amount of the foreign tax credit allowed, the net income
taxes imposed by Canada on the income are deducted first. Any remaining amount of the allowable
foreign tax credit reduces the provincial or territorial tax that qualifies for the credit under this
subdivision.

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290.17, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

to allocation outside this state. The allocation rules apply to nonresident individuals, estates,
trusts, nonresident partners of partnerships, nonresident shareholders of corporations treated as "S"
corporations under section 290.9725, and all corporations not having such an election in effect. If
a partnership or corporation would not otherwise be subject to the allocation rules, but conducts a
trade or business that is part of a unitary business involving another legal entity that is subject to
the allocation rules, the partnership or corporation is subject to the allocation rules.
    (b) Expenses, losses, and other deductions (referred to collectively in this paragraph as
"deductions") must be allocated along with the item or class of gross income to which they are
definitely related for purposes of assignment under this section or apportionment under section
290.191, 290.20, or 290.36. Deductions definitely related to any item of gross income assigned
under subdivision 2, paragraph (e), are assigned to the taxpayer's domicile.
    (c) In the case of an individual who is a resident or part-year resident for only part of a
taxable year, the individual's income, gains, losses, and deductions from the distributive share of
a partnership, S corporation, trust, or estate are not subject to allocation outside this state to the
extent of the distributive share multiplied by a ratio, the numerator of which is the number of days
the individual was a resident or part-year resident of this state during the tax year of the partnership,
S corporation, trust, or estate, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the taxable
year of the partnership, S corporation, trust, or estate.

entity by the person or corporation having legal control of the payment of the compensation when
the amount the person or corporation paid to the entertainment entity during the calendar year

clause, consenting to be the designated member does not create the jurisdiction to impose tax on the
designated member, other than as described in item (i).
   (iii) The member designated under this clause must apply for a business tax account identification
number.
    (c) The commissioner shall adopt rules for the filing of one return on behalf of the members

members of the group under rules adopted by the commissioner.
   (d) If a corporation claims on a return that it has paid tax in excess of the amount of taxes lawfully
due, that corporation must include on that return information necessary for payment of the tax in
excess of the amount lawfully due by electronic means.

    (b) A tax is imposed for each taxable year on a corporation required to file a return under
section 289A.12, subdivision 3, that is treated as an "S" corporation under section 290.9725 and on
a partnership required to file a return under section 289A.12, subdivision 3, other than a partnership
that derives over 80 percent of its income from farming. The tax imposed under this paragraph is
due on or before the due date of the return for the taxpayer due under section 289A.18, subdivision
1. The commissioner shall prescribe the return to be used for payment of this tax. The tax under this
paragraph is equal to the following amounts:
If the sum of the S corporation's or
partnership's Minnesota property,
payrolls, and sales or receipts is:                                  the tax equals:

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2010.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290.0922, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Inflation adjustment. The commissioner shall adjust the dollar amounts of both the
fee and the property, payrolls, and sales or receipts thresholds in subdivision 1 by the percentage
determined under the provisions of section 1(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, except that in section
1(f)(3)(B) the word "2010" must be substituted for the word "1992." For 2012, the commissioner
shall then determine the percent change from the 12 months ending on August 31, 2010, to the 12
months ending on August 31, 2011, and in each subsequent year, from the 12 months ending on
August 31, 2010, to the 12 months ending on August 31 of the year preceding the taxable year.
The determination of the commissioner pursuant to this subdivision is not a "rule" subject to the
Administrative Procedure Act in chapter 14. The fee amounts as adjusted must be rounded to the
nearest $10 amounts and the threshold amounts must be adjusted to the nearest $10,000 amounts.
For fee amounts that end in $5, the amount is rounded up to the nearest $10 amount and for threshold
amounts that end in $5,000, the amount is rounded up to the nearest $10,000.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290.17, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Unitary business principle. (a) If a trade or business conducted wholly within this
state or partly within and partly without this state is part of a unitary business, the entire income
of the unitary business is subject to apportionment pursuant to section 290.191. Notwithstanding
subdivision 2, paragraph (c), none of the income of a unitary business is considered to be derived
from any particular source and none may be allocated to a particular place except as provided by
the applicable apportionment formula. The provisions of this subdivision do not apply to business
income subject to subdivision 5, income of an insurance company, or income of an investment
company determined under section 290.36.
    (b) The term "unitary business" means business activities or operations which result in a flow of
value between them. The term may be applied within a single legal entity or between multiple entities
and without regard to whether each entity is a sole proprietorship, a corporation, a partnership or a
trust.
   (c) Unity is presumed whenever there is unity of ownership, operation, and use, evidenced by
centralized management or executive force, centralized purchasing, advertising, accounting, or other
20TH DAY]                                         THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2011                                                                      369

controlled interaction, but the absence of these centralized activities will not necessarily evidence
a nonunitary business. Unity is also presumed when business activities or operations are of mutual
benefit, dependent upon or contributory to one another, either individually or as a group.
    (d) Where a business operation conducted in Minnesota is owned by a business entity that carries
on business activity outside the state different in kind from that conducted within this state, and the
other business is conducted entirely outside the state, it is presumed that the two business operations
are unitary in nature, interrelated, connected, and interdependent unless it can be shown to the
contrary.
    (e) Unity of ownership is not deemed to exist when a corporation is involved unless that
corporation is a member of a group of two or more business entities and more than 50 percent
of the voting stock of each member of the group is directly or indirectly owned by a common
owner or by common owners, either corporate or noncorporate, or by one or more of the member
corporations of the group. For this purpose, the term "voting stock" shall include membership
interests of mutual insurance holding companies formed under section 66A.40.
     (f) The net income and apportionment factors under section 290.191 or 290.20 of foreign
corporations and other foreign entities which are part of a unitary business shall not be included
in the net income or the apportionment factors of the unitary business. A foreign corporation or
other foreign entity which is required to file a return under this chapter shall file on a separate
return basis. T  ­h e­n

   Sec. 11. [290.351] INSURANCE COMPANIES.
   Subdivision 1. Computation of net income. (a) The net income of insurance companies taxable
under this chapter must be computed as provided in this subdivision.
    (b) Each life insurance company must report to the commissioner the life insurance company
taxable net income as defined in section 801(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, incorporating any
elections made by the taxpayer in determining life insurance company taxable income for federal
income tax purposes.
     (c) Each insurance company other than a life insurance company must report to the
commissioner its federal taxable income as defined in section 832 of the Internal Revenue Code, or
its taxable investment income as defined in section 832 of the Internal Revenue Code, incorporating
any elections made by the taxpayer in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code in determining
federal taxable income or taxable investment income for federal income tax purposes.
   (d) The life insurance company taxable net income, federal taxable income, or taxable
investment income so reported is subject to the modifications provided in section 290.01,
subdivisions 19c to 19f.
    Subd. 2. Apportionment of taxable net income. (a) The commissioner shall compute therefrom
the taxable net income of insurance companies by assigning to this state that proportion thereof
which the gross premiums collected by them during the taxable year from old and new business
within this state bears to the total gross premiums collected by them during that year from their
entire old and new business, including reinsurance premiums; provided, the commissioner shall
add to the taxable net income so apportioned to this state the amount of any taxes on premiums paid
by the company by virtue of any law of this state (other than the surcharge on premiums imposed by
section 297I.10 and the surcharge imposed by section 168A.40, subdivision 3) which were deducted
from gross income by the company in arriving at its total net income.
    (b) For purposes of determining the Minnesota apportionment percentage, premiums from
reinsurance contracts in connection with property in or liability arising out of activity in, or in
connection with the lives or health of Minnesota residents are assigned to Minnesota and premiums
from reinsurance contracts in connection with property in or liability arising out of activity in, or in
connection with the lives or health of non-Minnesota residents are assigned outside of Minnesota.
Reinsurance premiums are presumed to be received for a Minnesota risk and are assigned to
Minnesota, if:
   (1) the reinsurance contract is assumed for a company domiciled in Minnesota; and
    (2) the taxpayer, upon request of the commissioner, fails to provide reliable records indicating
the reinsured contract covered non-Minnesota risks. For purposes of this paragraph, "Minnesota

risk" means coverage in connection with property in or liability arising out of activity in Minnesota,
or in connection with the lives or health of Minnesota residents.
    (c) The apportionment method prescribed by paragraph (b) is presumed to fairly and correctly
determine the taxpayer's taxable net income. If the method prescribed in paragraph (b) does not fairly
reflect all or any part of taxable net income, the taxpayer may petition for or the commissioner may
require the determination of taxable net income by use of another method if that method fairly
reflects taxable net income. A petition within the meaning of this section must be filed by the
taxpayer on such form as the commissioner requires.
    Subd. 3. Credit. An insurance company is allowed a credit against the tax computed under
sections 290.06, subdivision 1, and 290.0921, equal to any taxes based on premiums paid by it that
are attributable to the period for which the tax under this chapter is imposed by virtue of any law of
this state, other than the surcharge on premiums imposed by section 297I.10.
   Subd. 4. Nonprofit health service plan corporation. For purposes of this section, the taxable
income of a nonprofit health service plan corporation must be determined as provided under section
833 of the Internal Revenue Code and section 290.01, subdivisions 19c to 19f.
   Subd. 5. Definition of insurance company. For purposes of this section, the terms "insurance
company," "life insurance company," and "insurance company other than life" have the meanings
given in the Internal Revenue Code.
     Subd. 6. Guaranty association assessment offset. (a) An insurance company may offset against
its corporate franchise tax liability under this chapter any amount paid under assessments made for
insolvencies under sections 60C.01 to 60C.22, and any amount paid under assessments made under
sections 61B.18 to 61B.32, as follows:
    (1) Each assessment gives rise to an amount of offset equal to 20 percent of the amount of the
assessment for each of the five calendar years following the year in which the assessment was paid.
    (2) The amount of offset initially determined for each taxable year is the sum of the amounts
determined under clause (1) for that taxable year.
    (b)(1) Each year the commissioner shall compare total guaranty association assessments levied
over the preceding five calendar years to the sum of all premium tax and corporate franchise
tax revenues collected from insurance companies without reduction for any guaranty association
assessment offset, in the preceding calendar year, referred to in this subdivision as "preceding year
insurance tax revenues."
    (2) If total guaranty association assessments levied over the preceding five years exceed the
preceding year insurance tax revenues, insurance companies are allowed only a proportionate part
of the corporate franchise tax offset calculated under paragraph (a) for the current calendar year.
   (3) The proportionate part of the corporate franchise tax offset allowed in the current calendar
year is determined by multiplying the amount calculated under paragraph (a) by a fraction, the
numerator of which equals the preceding year insurance tax revenues and the denominator of which
equals total guaranty association assessments levied over the preceding five-year period.
    (4) The proportionate part of the premium tax offset that is not allowed must be carried forward
to subsequent tax years and added to the amount of corporate franchise tax offset calculated under
374                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [20TH DAY

paragraph (a) before application of the limitation imposed by this paragraph.
    (5) Any amount carried forward from prior years must be allowed before allowance of the offset
for the current year calculated under paragraph (a).
   (6) The corporate franchise tax offset limitation must be calculated separately for (1) insurance
companies subject to assessment under sections 60C.01 to 60C.22, and (2) insurance companies
subject to assessment under sections 61B.18 to 61B.32.
   (7) When the corporate franchise tax offset is limited by this provision, the commissioner of
revenue will notify affected insurance companies on a timely basis for purposes of completing
premium and corporate franchise tax returns.
    (8) The guaranty associations created under sections 60C.01 to 60C.22 and sections 61B.18
to 61B.32, shall provide the commissioner of revenue with the necessary information on guaranty
association assessments.
    (c)(1) If the offset determined by the application of paragraphs (a) and (b) exceeds the greater of
the insurance company's corporate franchise tax liability under this chapter prior to allowance of the
credit provided by subdivision 3 or its premium tax liability under chapter 297I, then the insurance
company may carry forward the excess, referred to in this subdivision as the "carryforward credit,"
to subsequent taxable years.
    (2) The carryforward credit must be allowed as an offset against corporate franchise tax liability
for the first succeeding year to the extent that the corporate franchise tax liability for that year
exceeds the amount of the allowable offset for the year determined under paragraphs (a) and (b).
    (3) The carryforward credit must be reduced, but not below zero, by the greater of the amount
of the carryforward credit allowed as an offset against the corporate franchise tax under this
paragraph or the amount of the carryforward credit allowed as an offset against the insurance
company's premium tax liability under chapter 297I under section 297I.20, paragraph (c). The
remainder, if any, of the carryforward credit must be carried forward to succeeding taxable years
until the entire carryforward credit has been credited against the insurance company's liability for
corporate franchise tax under this chapter and premium tax under chapter 297I.
    (d) When an insurer has offset against taxes its payment of an assessment of the Minnesota Life
and Health Guaranty Association, and the association pays the insurer a refund with respect to the
assessment under section 61B.24, subdivision 6, then the refund reduces the insurer's carryforward
credit under paragraph (c). If the refund exceeds the amount of the carryforward credit, the excess
amount must be repaid to the state by the insurers to the extent of the offset in the manner the
commissioner requires.

section. The state general levy base amount for commercial-industrial property is $      ­5

                                           ­ 2012. The state general levy base amount for seasonal
residential recreational property is $40,222,000 for taxes payable in 2012. The state general levy
base amount for high-valued homes is $57,000,000 for taxes payable in 2012. For taxes payable
in subsequent years, ­ht­­e each levy base amount is increased each year by multiplying the levy
base amount for the prior year by the sum of one plus the rate of increase, if any, in the implicit
price deflator for government consumption expenditures and gross investment for state and local
governments prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysts of the United States Department of
Commerce for the 12-month period ending March 31 of the year prior to the year the taxes are
payable. The tax under this section is not treated as a local tax rate under section 469.177 and is not
the levy of a governmental unit under chapters 276A and 473F.
    The commissioner shall increase or decrease the preliminary or final ­     r­
                                                                                a­e

necessary to account for errors and tax base changes that affected a preliminary or final rate for either
of the two preceding years. Adjustments are allowed to the extent that the necessary information is
available to the commissioner at the time the rates for a year must be certified, and for the following
reasons:
   (1) an erroneous report of taxable value by a local official;
   (2) an erroneous calculation by the commissioner; and
    (3) an increase or decrease in taxable value for commercial-industrial ­ o­
                                                                              r, seasonal residential
recreational property, or high-valued homes, reported on the abstracts of tax lists submitted under
section 275.29 that was not reported on the abstracts of assessment submitted under section 270C.89
for the same year.
The commissioner may, but need not, make adjustments if the total difference in the tax levied for
the year would be less than $100,000.

therein any property omitted from the federal gross estate which is includable therein, has its situs
in Minnesota, and was not disclosed to federal taxing authorities.
   (6) "Nonresident decedent" means an individual whose domicile at the time of death was not in
Minnesota.
    (7) "Personal representative" means the executor, administrator or other person appointed

question arises. It must lie over one day before being given its second reading.
    4.10 A member may question the reference of a bill during the order of business of first reading

   An omnibus appropriation or tax bill may not be divided.
    7.4 An amendment to an omnibus appropriation or tax bill that is a Senate file or an unofficial
engrossment of a House file is out of order if it will increase net appropriations from a fund for a fiscal
biennium, compared to the bill as it was reported to the floor of the Senate, without a corresponding
increase in net revenue.
    7.5 An amendment to an omnibus appropriation or tax bill that is a Senate file or an unofficial
engrossment of a House file is out of order if it will reduce net revenue to a fund for a fiscal biennium,
compared to the bill as it was reported to the floor of the Senate, without a corresponding reduction
in net appropriations.
    7.6 An amendment to an omnibus appropriation or tax bill that is a Senate file or an unofficial
engrossment of a House file is out of order if it will change appropriations, transfers, or revenues
to an agency that was not in the bill as it was reported to the floor of the Senate, or will create or
increase the amount of a tax expenditure by reducing appropriations, transfers, or revenues to an
agency that was not in the bill as it was reported to the floor of the Senate.

consideration is out of order if it will increase net appropriations from or reduce net revenue in

consideration by the Senate before adjournment of the regular session, unless the appointee's term
has expired or the appointee is no longer serving.
    8.3 The final question on the appointment is, "Will the Senate, having given its advice, now
consent to this appointment?" The question must not be put the same day the appointment is
received or on the day it is reported by committee except by unanimous consent. Confirmation of

shall immediately call the members to order and, on the appearance of a quorum, shall proceed with
the regular order of business.
   14.2 The President may call a member to preside. In the absence of the President, the President
Pro Tem, the Chair of the Committee on Rules and Administration, or the Chair's designee, shall
preside over the Senate. In the absence of the President and the Chair, the Senate may select a
member to perform the duties of the President. Substitutions do not extend beyond adjournment.

to members, and shall also decide all questions of order, subject to an appeal to the Senate by a
member.
    14.4 An appeal is decided by a majority vote of those present and voting. Upon an appeal from
the decision of the President, the question is, "Shall the decision of the President be the judgment
of the Senate?"
   14.5 The President shall sign all acts, memorials, addresses and resolutions. All writs, warrants,
and subpoenas issued by the Senate must be signed by the President and attested by the Secretary.
    14.6 Upon a finding by the Committee on Rules and Administration that the President refuses or
is unable to sign any of the documents described in this rule, the Chair of the Committee on Rules
and Administration, or some other member selected by the committee, shall assume the duties of
the President under this rule until the President is able to sign the documents described or until the
Senate elects a new President, whichever occurs first.

organizations who provide news coverage of the legislature will be administered and the provisions
of this rule enforced exclusively by the Sergeant at Arms, with the exception of an appeal under
Rule 16.4.
   16.2 The Sergeant at Arms may not issue credentials or day passes under Rule 16.3 to political
organizations. For the purposes of this rule, "political organization" means an organization owned
or controlled by a registered lobbyist, a political party, or any party organization. "Political
organization" also includes an organization registered with the Campaign Finance Board, the
Federal Election Commission, or an organization subject to Minnesota Statutes, chapter 10A or
211A.
    16.3 Due to the limited space available for organizations or individuals providing news coverage
of the Senate, the Senate finds that there is a compelling public interest in limiting credentials
to organizations or individuals who demonstrate that they provide frequent news coverage of the
legislature. For that reason, the following rules apply:
    (a) Organizations or individuals requesting credentials must furnish, upon the request of
the Sergeant at Arms, three examples of news coverage of legislative matters produced by the
organization or individual. The examples must include written, video, or audio coverage written
or recorded in the past year, and a description of how they were publicly distributed. Any opinion
expressed in the examples is not subject to review under this rule at any time. An organization
requesting credentials may include only one individual.

   (b) For session credentials, an organization or individual must submit an application to the
Sergeant at Arms. The Sergeant at Arms must review the application and approve or reject it within
14 days after receipt.
   (c) If an application is rejected, the Sergeant at Arms must state the reason for the rejection in
writing and notify the applicant, the Secretary of the Senate, the Majority Leader, and the Minority
Leader in writing.
    (d) The Sergeant at Arms may grant day passes upon the request of a member or upon the request
of an individual or organization who has not applied for credentials and who is not prohibited from
receiving credentials under Rule 16.2.
   16.4 An appeal of a denial of credentials must be made in writing to the Secretary of the
Senate, the Senate Majority Leader, and the Senate Minority Leader. The Committee on Rules and
Administration shall review and decide the appeal within 14 days after receiving a letter of appeal.
     16.5 For individuals and organizations with credentials and passes issued under this rule, the
Secretary of the Senate shall provide at least six spaces on the Senate floor and at least ten spaces
in the Senate gallery. Because of limited space on the floor, at least four spaces must be reserved
for credentialed individuals from news organizations with leases in the Capitol press area. At least
four seats in the gallery must be reserved for credentialed individuals from television news stations
with leases in the Capitol press area. All other gallery access will be provided on a first-come,
first-served basis to individuals and organizations with credentials and passes issued under this rule.
The Sergeant at Arms shall ensure that an opportunity to register for access under this rule is publicly
available outside the main doors of the Senate Chamber at all times. This procedure will be used
to determine floor access priority for individuals with credentials whose organizations do not lease
space in the Capitol press area. If the designated floor and gallery space is full, the Sergeant at Arms
may limit access for an organization to one individual in order to provide space for individuals from
other organizations. Individuals with session credentials have priority for admission over individuals
with day passes. All credentialed individuals shall be admitted to the floor when the Senate is not
meeting in the same manner provided for credentialed individuals who have been admitted to the
floor when the Senate is meeting. The documents provided to credentialed individuals present on
the floor when the Senate is meeting shall be made available in the Senate Information Office to
other credentialed individuals.

committee may recommend that the bill be placed on the Consent Calendar. If the committee report
is adopted, the bill must be electronically available or printed and placed on the Consent Calendar
after its second reading. On the question of adoption of the report, the question of accepting the
recommendation that the bill be placed on the Consent Calendar may be divided from the question
of adopting the report in other respects.
  25.2 A majority of the whole Senate, or the Chair of the Committee on Rules and Administration,
may order a bill on General Orders placed on the Consent Calendar.
   25.3 The Consent Calendar must be electronically available or printed at least one calendar day

    25.4 If a member objects to consideration of a bill on the Consent Calendar at any time during its
consideration in the Senate before the question on final passage is put, and that objection is supported
by at least two other members, the bill is referred to the Committee of the Whole, and the Secretary
shall place it at the bottom of General Orders subject to Rule 22.2, except that it need not lie over
one calendar day before consideration in the Committee of the Whole.

after specific other business is completed.

   26.4 As nearly as applicable, debate on the bill and all proceedings including amendments and
substitutions must be conducted as in the Committee of the Whole.
   26.5 On any question, a member may request a roll call vote, which must be entered in the
Journal.

                                                    27. MOTIONS
    27.1 A motion or amendment must be written if a member requests. It must identify the member
or committee offering it.
   27.2 When a motion is made, it must be stated by the President. If it is in writing, it must be
handed to the Secretary and read to the members.
   27.3 After a motion is stated by the President, or read by the Secretary, it is in possession of the
Senate, but may be withdrawn by the author at any time before decision or amendment.


                                      28. PRECEDENCE OF MOTIONS
    28.1 When a question is under debate no motion may be made, except:
         1. To adjourn.
         2. To recess.
         3. To reconsider.
         4. To lay on the table.
         5. For the previous question.
         6. To refer.
         7. To postpone to a day certain.
         8. To amend.
         9. To postpone indefinitely.
    28.2 Motions numbered 1, 2, 4 and 5 above are not debatable.
   28.3 These motions have precedence in the foregoing order; but when a motion for the previous
question has been made, or the main question ordered, a motion to lay on the table is not in order.
   28.4 A motion to postpone to a day certain, to refer, to postpone indefinitely, or to amend, having
been decided, may not again be put on the same day, nor at the same stage of the bill or proposition.


                                          29. MOTION TO ADJOURN
    A motion to adjourn or a motion to adjourn to a time certain is always in order. The latter motion
is debatable solely as to the time. When either motion is rejected, it may not be renewed until further
business has been transacted.
                                 30. MOTION TO RECONSIDER
  30.1 When a motion or question has been decided, a member who voted with the prevailing side
may move for reconsideration:
    (1) on the same day on which the vote was taken ­
                                                    o­r;
20TH DAY]                           THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2011                                           405

   (2) within the next two calendar days; or,
                                            ­
    (3) if ­a
           l­­e
              t­­
                r­
                 , after the time provided under clause (1) or (2), on the first day the Senate meets after
the vote was taken. The motion takes precedence over all other questions except a motion to adjourn
or recess.
   30.2 When a motion to adjourn is adopted before the disposition of ­h        t­­
                                                                                  e a motion for
reconsideration, ­
                 a the motion for reconsideration must lie over until the next succeeding day the
Senate meets except as provided in this rule.

      .­ 30.3 When notice of intent to move reconsideration of the final action of the Senate on a
question is given by a member, the Secretary shall retain the subject of the notice until after the
expiration of the time during which the motion can be made.
    ­0
    3 ­­3
       .­ 30.4 A notice of intent to move for reconsideration is not in order after the Tuesday before
the third Saturday in May, but a motion to reconsider may be made.
   ­0
   3 ­­4
      .­ 30.5 A motion for reconsideration having been once voted on may not be made again nor
reconsidered.
                     31. MOTION FOR THE PREVIOUS QUESTION
   31.1 Unless a motion for the previous question is made specifically applicable to a subsidiary
motion, it must be in this form: "Shall the main question now be put?" If the motion for the previous
question is supported by a majority of the members present, its effect is to put an end to all debate
and bring the Senate to a direct vote upon all pending amendments in their order and then upon the
main question.
   31.2 On a motion for the previous question, a call of the Senate is in order before the President
submits the question to the Senate.
    31.3 On a motion for the previous question there is no debate. All incidental questions of order,
arising after a motion is made for the previous question, and pending the motion, must be decided,
whether on appeal or otherwise, without debate.


                                      32. MOTION TO REFER
     A bill or resolution may be referred to committee at any time before its passage. If an amendment
is reported on the referral to any committee other than the Committee of the Whole, it must again be
read the second time, considered in Committee of the Whole, read the third time and placed on final
passage. If the referral is to the Committee of the Whole it must be placed at the head of General
Orders, except when the referral is from the Consent Calendar under Rule 25.4.


                      33. MOTION TO AMEND BILL OR RESOLUTION
    33.1 A motion to amend must be written if a member requests. It must identify the member
offering it.
    33.2 In drawing an amendment to a bill or resolution, reference must be made, first to the number
of the bill, then to the page, and then to the line or lines where language is to be stricken or inserted.
406                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [20TH DAY

    33.3 In filling blanks, the largest sum, the longest time and the greatest distance must be first
taken.
   33.4 The title to a bill may be amended by the Secretary at any time the bill is amended by the
Senate.
   33.5 An amendment is not in order to a bill on the Calendar or after third reading without the
unanimous consent of the Senate unless it:
   (1) fills a blank,
                    ­;
   (2) amends the title,
                       ­;
   (3) is proposed to the chief author of the bill by the Revisor of Statutes to correct technical
defects found by the Revisor while engrossing earlier amendments to the bill,
                                                                            ­; or
   (4) is proposed to a bill on the Consent Calendar before the bill is given its third reading.


                              34. MOTION TO SUSPEND RULES
   34.1 A rule may be suspended by a vote of at least two-thirds of the whole Senate.
    34.2 A motion to suspend the rules for the purpose of advancing a bill may be made only under
the order of business, "Motions and Resolutions".


                                       35. GERMANENESS
    35.1 An amendment proposed to the Senate or to the Committee of the Whole that is not germane
is out of order.
   35.2 A non-germane amendment includes one that:
   (1) relates to a substantially different subject,
                                                   ­; or
   (2) is intended to accomplish a substantially different purpose, than that of the original bill to
which it is proposed.
    35.3 An amendment to insert a constitutional amendment is not germane to a bill that does not
already include a constitutional amendment.
   35.4 Whether an amendment is germane is to be decided by the President, who may put the
question to the body if the President chooses.
    35.5 A motion to remove an amendment placed on a House bill under Rule 45.1 is out of order
if removal of the amendment would make a portion of the House bill not germane to the Senate
companion for which it was substituted.
    35.6 If a House amendment to a Senate bill is not germane to the Senate bill, a motion to concur
in the House amendment is out of order.
                                         36. DEBATE
   36.1 When a member is about to speak to the Senate, the member shall rise and respectfully
20TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2011                                           407

excepted to must be taken down in writing by the Secretary immediately.

has been made available electronically or printed and placed on the desk of each member, or at an
earlier time agreed to by a majority of the whole Senate.


                                  37. ABSENCE OF MEMBERS

                                   38. CALL OF THE SENATE
   38.1 A member may impose a call of the Senate requiring the attendance of all members before

the whole Senate, or until the Senate adjourns.
   38.4 A majority of the whole Senate may excuse members not answering the call.

    39.1 A member may call for a division of the question when the division is possible. A motion
to strike and insert is indivisible.
    39.2 The defeat of a motion to strike does not preclude an amendment nor a motion to strike and
insert.
                                            40. VOTING

of the electrical voting system under the control of the President.

    40.6 A member or other person may not proceed to or remain by the Secretary's desk while a

of the Whole, shall vote upon the request of another member unless excused by the Senate.

Senate may, by motion, direct the President to close the roll.
    41.4 The vote on a motion to close the roll must be taken without debate. No member is required
to vote on the motion.
                                      42. FINAL PASSAGE
   The final question on a bill or other matter requiring action by both Houses after its first and

   43.1 Except when a motion to reconsider has been made as provided in Rule 30, immediately
20TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2011                                          409

after the passage of a bill or other matter in which the concurrence of the House of Representatives
is requested, the Secretary shall transmit it to the House.
   43.2 On the concurrence of a bill or other matter of the House by the Senate, or on the
concurrence or disagreement in a vote of the House, the Secretary shall notify the House.


                       44. ENGROSSING AND ENROLLING OF BILLS
    44.1 The Secretary and the Engrossing Secretary shall ensure that every bill, memorial, or
resolution originating in the Senate is carefully engrossed before it is transmitted to the House of
Representatives for concurrence.
   All engrossing and enrolling of bills shall be done at the direction and under authority of the
Senate.
    44.2 The Secretary shall ensure that every bill, memorial, or resolution originating in the Senate
is carefully enrolled by the Revisor of Statutes before it is presented to the Governor or filed with
the Secretary of State.


                     45. COMPARISON AND SUBSTITUTION OF BILLS
    45.1 A House bill, after its first reading, must be referred as follows, unless there is a motion by
the Chair of the Committee on Rules and Administration or a designee of the Chair:
    (a) If there is no Senate companion bill, the House bill must be referred to the appropriate
standing committee, unless there is objection under Rule 4.10.
   (b) If there is a Senate companion bill, the House bill must be referred to the standing committee
possessing the Senate companion.
    (c) If the Senate companion bill has been reported to the Senate, the House bill must be referred
to the Committee on Rules and Administration, which shall report whether the House bill is identical
to the Senate companion bill. If the bills are identical, the report must recommend that the House bill
be given its second reading and substituted for the Senate companion bill and the Senate companion
bill be indefinitely postponed. If the House bill is not identical to the Senate companion bill, the
report of the committee must recommend an amendment to the House bill that when adopted will
render the House bill identical to the Senate bill. Upon adoption of a committee report containing the
proposed amendment, the House bill as amended must be given its second reading and substituted
for the Senate companion bill and the Senate companion bill must be indefinitely postponed.
   45.2 The Secretary shall prepare and submit reports under this rule on behalf of the Committee
on Rules and Administration.
    45.3 A House bill placed on the Calendar by substitution must not be given its third reading on
the same day as the substitution.


                               46. CONFERENCE COMMITTEES
   46.1 The Committee on Rules and Administration may constitute a standing Subcommittee on
410                                            JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                    [20TH DAY

Conference Committees, the report of which within its jurisdiction has the effect of a report of
the Committee on Rules and Administration. The subcommittee consists of three members, one of
whom must be a member of the minority group.
    46.2 The Subcommittee on Conference Committees shall appoint all conference committees of
the Senate and report the appointments to the Senate. In the appointment of members of conference
committees between the two houses, the Subcommittee on Conference Committees shall appoint
those who are in accord with the position of the Senate. Whenever practical, the subcommittee shall
give preference to authors of bills in dispute and to members of standing committees in which the
bills were considered.


                            47. DISPOSITION OF BILLS ON ADJOURNMENT
     Adjournment of the regular session in an odd-numbered year to a date certain in the following
year is equivalent to daily adjournment, except that a bill on the Calendar, Consent Calendar, General
Orders, or table, other than a bill laid on the table after being vetoed by the governor or after its
conference committee has been discharged under Joint Rule 3.02, must be returned to the standing
committee other than the Committee on Rules and Administration from which it was last reported to
the Senate, unless otherwise provided for by motion before adjournment. B                             ­­l

the subcommittee to provide its advice on a potential conflict of interest to the member in private. If

member or employee of the Senate. The subcommittee has the powers of a standing committee to
issue subpoenas under Minnesota Statutes, section 3.153.
   55.4 Within 30 calendar days after receiving a complaint, the subcommittee must meet and either
make a finding of no probable cause, vote to defer action until a certain time, or proceed with its
investigation.
    55.5 In order to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that improper conduct has
occurred, the subcommittee may, by a vote of three of its members, conduct a preliminary inquiry in
executive session to which the open meeting requirements of Rules 12.1 to 12.3 do not apply. The
executive session may be ordered by a vote of three of its members whenever the subcommittee
determines that matters relating to probable cause are likely to be discussed. The executive session
must be limited to matters relating to probable cause. Upon a finding of probable cause, further
proceedings on the complaint are open to the public.
    55.6 The subcommittee may appoint special counsel to provide expert advice on how to conduct
its proceedings. The subcommittee may appoint a suitable person to conduct the investigation and
report findings of fact and recommendations for action to the subcommittee.

it shall recommend to the Committee on Rules and Administration appropriate disciplinary action.
    55.8 To minimize disruption of its public proceedings, the subcommittee may require that
television coverage be pooled or be provided by Senate media services.
   55.9 If criminal proceedings relating to the same conduct have begun, the subcommittee may
defer its proceedings until the criminal proceedings have been completed.
   55.10 The Senate intends that proceedings of the Subcommittee on Ethical Conduct not be
admissible in any criminal proceeding.

to know that the material includes any statement that is false or clearly misleading, concerning a
public policy issue or concerning the member's or another member's voting record or position on a
public policy issue.
    56.3 Improper conduct includes conduct that violates a rule or administrative policy of the
Senate, that violates accepted norms of Senate behavior, that betrays the public trust, or that tends
to bring the Senate into dishonor or disrepute.
   56.4 Members of the Senate shall disclose potential conflicts of interest in the discharge of
senatorial duties as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 10A.07.
