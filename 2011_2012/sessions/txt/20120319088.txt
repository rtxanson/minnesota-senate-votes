   (1) manage the school trust lands efficiently;
   (2) reduce the management expenditures of school trust lands and maximize the revenues
deposited in the permanent school trust fund;
   (3) manage the sale, exchange, and commercial leasing of school trust lands to maximize the
revenues deposited in the permanent school trust fund and retain the value from the long-term
appreciation of the school trust lands; and
    (4) manage the school trust lands to maximize the long-term economic return for the permanent
school trust fund while maintaining sound natural resource conservation and management
principles.
    (b) When the commissioner finds an irresolvable conflict between maximizing the long-term
economic return and protecting natural resources and recreational values on school trust lands, the
commissioner shall give precedence to the long-term economic return in managing school trust
lands. By July 1, 2016, the permanent school fund shall be compensated for all school trust lands
included under a designation or policy provision that prohibits long-term economic return. Any
uncompensated designation or policy provision restrictions on the long-term economic return on
school trust lands is removed on July 1, 2016, and the lands shall be managed for long-term economic
return to the permanent school fund.
   (c) The first 2013 report required under paragraph (a) shall provide an inventory and
identification of all school trust lands that are included under a designation or policy provision that
prohibits long-term economic return. The report shall include a plan to compensate the permanent
school fund through the purchase or exchange of the lands or a plan to manage the school trust
land to generate long-term economic return to the permanent school fund. Subsequent reports
under paragraph (a) shall include a status report of the commissioner's progress in maximizing the
long-term economic return on lands identified in the first 2013 report.
    (d) When future designations or policies prohibit the long-term economic return on school trust
land, the conflict shall be resolved by compensating the permanent school fund though an exchange
or purchase of the lands before designation or application of the policy."

Managed care contracts which were in effect on June 30, 1995, and set to renew on July 1, 1995,
shall be renewed for the period July 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995 at the same terms that
were in effect on June 30, 1995. The commissioner may issue separate contracts with requirements
specific to services to medical assistance recipients age 65 and older.
   (b) A prepaid health plan providing covered health services for eligible persons pursuant to
chapters 256B and 256L is responsible for complying with the terms of its contract with the
commissioner. Requirements applicable to managed care programs under chapters 256B and
256L established after the effective date of a contract with the commissioner take effect when the
contract is next issued or renewed.
    (c) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2003, the commissioner shall withhold
five percent of managed care plan payments under this section and county-based purchasing

federal or state law or rule. Criteria for assessment of each performance target must be outlined
in writing prior to the contract effective date. Clinical or utilization performance targets and
their related criteria must consider evidence-based research and reasonable interventions when
available or applicable to the populations served, and must be developed with input from external
clinical experts and stakeholders, including managed care and county-based purchasing plans and
providers. The managed care plan must demonstrate, to the commissioner's satisfaction, that the
data submitted regarding attainment of the performance target is accurate. The commissioner shall
periodically change the administrative measures used as performance targets in order to improve
plan performance across a broader range of administrative services. The performance targets must
include measurement of plan efforts to contain spending on health care services and administrative
activities. The commissioner may adopt plan-specific performance targets that take into account
factors affecting only one plan, including characteristics of the plan's enrollee population. The
withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July of the following year if performance targets
in the contract are achieved. The commissioner may exclude special demonstration projects under
subdivision 23.

an RFP for each construction manager/general contractor contract as provided in this section. The
RFP must contain, at a minimum, the following elements:
   (1) the minimum qualifications of the construction manager/general contractor;
    (2) the procedures for submitting proposals and the criteria for evaluation of qualifications and
the relative weight for each criteria;
   (3) the form of the contract to be awarded;
   (4) the scope of intended construction work;
   (5) a listing of the types of preconstruction services that will be required;
   (6) an anticipated schedule for commencing and completing the project;
   (7) any applicable budget limits for the project;
   (8) the requirements for insurance, statutorily required performance, and payment bonds;
    (9) the requirements that the construction manager/general contractor provide a letter from a
surety or insurance company stating that the construction manager/general contractor is capable of
obtaining a performance bond and payment bond covering the estimated contract cost;
    (10) the method for how construction manager/general contractor fees for the preconstruction
services contract will be negotiated;
    (11) a statement that past performance or experience does not include the exercise or assertion
of a person's legal rights; and
   (12) any other information desired by the commissioner.
   (b) Before receiving any responses to the RFP:
   (1) the commissioner shall appoint a technical review committee of at least five individuals, of
which one is a Department of Transportation manager who is also a licensed professional engineer
in Minnesota;
    (2) the technical review committee shall evaluate the construction manager/general contractor
proposals according to criteria and subcriteria published in the RFP and procedures established
by the commissioner. The commissioner shall, as designated in the RFP, evaluate construction
manager/general contractor proposals on the basis of best value as defined in section 16C.05, or
using the qualifications-based selection process set forth in section 16C.095, except that subdivision
1 of section 16C.095 shall not apply. If the commissioner does not receive at least two proposals
from construction managers, the commissioner may:
   (i) solicit new proposals;
   (ii) revise the RFP and thereafter solicit new proposals using the revised RFP;

   (iii) select another allowed procurement method; or
   (iv) reject the proposals; and
   (3) the technical review committee shall evaluate the responses to the request for proposals and
rank the construction manager/general contractor based on the predefined criteria set forth in the
RFP in accordance with paragraph (a), clause (2).
    (c) Unless all proposals are rejected, the commissioner shall conduct contract negotiations for a
preconstruction services contract with the construction manager/general contractor with the highest
ranking. If the construction manager/general contractor with the highest ranking declines or is unable
to reach an agreement, the commissioner may begin contract negotiations with the next highest
ranked construction manager/general contractor.
   (d) Before issuing the RFP, the commissioner may elect to issue a request for qualifications
(RFQ) and short-list the most highly qualified construction managers/general contractors. The RFQ
must include the procedures for submitting statements of qualification, the criteria for evaluation of
qualifications, and the relative weight for each criterion. The statements of qualifications must be
evaluated by the technical review committee.
   Subd. 3. Phase 2 - construction manager/general contractor contract. (a) Before conducting
any construction-related services, the commissioner shall:
   (1) conduct an independent cost estimate for the project or each work package; and
    (2) conduct contract negotiations with the construction manager/general contractor to develop
a construction manager/general contractor contract. This contract must include a minimum
construction manager/general contractor self-performing requirement of 30 percent of the
negotiated cost. Items designated in the construction manager/general contractor contract as
specialty items may be subcontracted and the cost of any specialty item performed under the
subcontract will be deducted from the cost before computing the amount of work required to be
performed by the contractor.
    (b) If the construction manager/general contractor and the commissioner are unable to negotiate
a contract, the commissioner may use other contract procurement processes or may readvertise
the construction manager/general contractor contract. The construction manager/general contractor
may (1) bid or propose on the project if advertised under section 161.32 or 161.3206 or (2) join a
design-build team if advertised under sections 161.3410 to 161.3428.
    (c) The commissioner shall provide to all bidders or design-build teams, all data shared between
the commissioner and the construction manager/general contractor during the contract negotiations
under this subdivision.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and expires
one year following the acceptance of ten construction manager/general contractor contracts.

    Subd. 4. Contract awards, limitations. Contracts awarded pursuant to this section are subject
to all limitations contained in rules adopted by the commissioner of administration.
    Subd. 4a. Limited duration and reevaluation. The commissioner shall cooperate with
the commissioner of administration to periodically reevaluate the targeted group businesses to

owned by targeted group members among all businesses in the state in the construction category.
The commissioner of administration shall designate targeted groups pursuant to section 16C.16,
subdivision 5.

    (b) In addition to other eligibility requirements, a small targeted group business or veteran-owned
small business is eligible for the bid preferences under this section only for eight years following the
later of: (1) the effective date of this act; or (2) the date of initial designation as a small targeted group
business or veteran-owned small business by the commissioner of administration under section
16C.16.

   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 162.09, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Federal census is conclusive. (a) In determining whether any city has a population
of 5,000 or more, the last federal census shall be conclusive, except as otherwise provided in this
subdivision.
    (b) The governing body of a city may contract with the United States Bureau of the Census to take
a special census. A certified copy of the results of the census shall be filed with the appropriate state
authorities by the city. The result of the census shall be the population of the city for the purposes of
any law providing that population is a required qualification for distribution of highway aids under
chapter 162. The special census shall remain in effect until the next federal census is completed and
filed. The expense of taking the special census shall be paid by the city.
    (c) If an entire area not heretofore incorporated as a city is incorporated as such during the
interval between federal censuses, its population shall be determined by its incorporation census.
The incorporation census shall be determinative of the population of the city only until the next
federal census.
    (d) The population of a city created by the consolidation of two or more previously incorporated
cities shall be determined by the most recent population estimate of the Metropolitan Council or state
demographer, until the first federal decennial census or special census taken after the consolidation.
    (e) The population of a city that is not receiving a municipal state-aid street fund apportionment
shall be determined, upon request of the city, by the most recent population estimate of the
Metropolitan Council or state demographer. A municipal state-aid street fund apportionment
received by the city must be based on this population estimate until the next federal decennial
census or special census.
    (f) A city that is found in the most recent federal decennial census to have fewer than 5,000
population is deemed for the purposes of this chapter and the Minnesota Constitution, article XIV,
to have a population of 5,000 or more under the following circumstances: (1) immediately before
the most recent federal decennial census, the city was receiving municipal state-aid street fund
distributions; and (2) the population of the city was found in the most recent federal decennial
census to be fewer than 5,000. Following the end of the first calendar year that ends in "4" after the
decennial census and until the next decennial census, the population of any city must be determined
under paragraphs (a) to (e).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2012.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 162.13, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Factors in formula. After deducting for administrative costs and for the disaster
fund and research account as heretofore provided, and for any allocation made under section
162.125, the remainder of the total sum provided for in subdivision 1 of section 162.12 shall be
identified as the apportionment sum, and shall be apportioned by the commissioner to the cities
having a population of 5,000 or more, in accordance with the following formula:
    (1) An amount equal to 50 percent of such apportionment sum shall be apportioned among the
cities having a population of 5,000 or more so that each such city shall receive of such amount the
percentage that its money needs bears to the total money needs of all such cities.

    (2) An amount equal to 50 percent of such apportionment sum shall be apportioned among the
cities having a population of 5,000 or more so that each such city shall receive of such amount
the percentage that its population bears to the total population of all such cities. For purposes of
this subdivision, population of a city is the greater of 5,000 or the number calculated under section
162.09, subdivision 4, paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e).

    (c) The rules adopted by the commissioner under this section, and sections 162.02; 162.07,
subdivision 2; 162.09; and 162.13, subdivision 2, are exempt from the rulemaking provisions of
chapter 14. The rules are subject to section 14.386, except that, notwithstanding paragraph (b) of
that section, the rules continue in effect until repealed or superseded by other law or rule.
    Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 168.10, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
     Subd. 1a. Collector's vehicle, pioneer plate. (a) Any motor vehicle that: (1) was manufactured
prior to 1936 or is a restored pioneer vehicle, as defined in section 168A.01, subdivision 16a; and
(2) is owned and operated solely as a collector's item shall be listed for taxation and registration ­
                                                                                                     a­

         : as provided by paragraph (b).
    (b) An affidavit shall be executed stating the name and address of the owner, the name and
address of the person from whom purchased, the make of the motor vehicle, year and number of the
model, the manufacturer's identification number and that the vehicle is owned and operated solely
as a collector's item and not for general transportation purposes. If the commissioner is satisfied
that the affidavit is true and correct and the owner pays a $25 tax and the plate fee authorized under
section 168.12, the commissioner shall list such vehicle for taxation and registration and shall issue
a single number plate.
    ­
    (b
     ­­) (c) The number plate so issued shall bear the inscription "Pioneer," "Minnesota" and the
registration number or other combination of characters authorized under section 168.12, subdivision
2a, but no date. The number plate is valid without renewal as long as the vehicle is in existence in
Minnesota. The commissioner has the power to revoke said plate for failure to comply with this
subdivision.
    Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 168.27, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
  Subd. 2. New motor vehicle dealer. (a) A new motor vehicle dealer licensee may sell, broker,
wholesale, or auction and solicit and advertise the sale, brokerage, wholesale, or auction of new

motor vehicles covered by the franchise and any used motor vehicles, and may lease and solicit and
advertise the lease of new motor vehicles and any used motor vehicles. New motor vehicle dealer
sales or leases may be either for consumer use at retail or for resale to a dealer. A new motor vehicle
dealer may engage in the business of buying or otherwise acquiring vehicles for dismantling the
vehicles and selling used parts and remaining scrap materials under chapter 168A, except that a new
motor vehicle dealer may not purchase a junked vehicle from a salvage pool, insurance company,
or its agent unless the dealer is also licensed as a used vehicle parts dealer or licensed as a scrap
metal processor. Nothing in this subdivision requires an applicant for a dealer license who proposes
to deal in: (1) new and unused motor vehicle bodies; or (2) type A, B, or C motor homes as defined
in section 168.002, subdivision 27, to have a bona fide contract or franchise in effect with either
the first-stage manufacturer of the motor home or the manufacturer or distributor of any motor
vehicle chassis upon which the new and unused motor vehicle body is mounted. The modification
or conversion of a new van-type vehicle into a multipurpose passenger vehicle which is not a motor
home does not constitute dealing in new or unused motor vehicle bodies, and a person engaged
in the business of selling these van-type vehicles must have a bona fide contract or franchise with
the appropriate manufacturer under subdivision 10. A van converter or modifier who owns these
modified or converted van-type vehicles may sell them at wholesale to new motor vehicle dealers
having a bona fide contract or franchise with the first-stage manufacturer of the vehicles.
    (b) The requirements pertaining to franchises do not apply to persons who remodel or convert
motor vehicles for medical purposes. For purposes of this subdivision, "medical purpose" means
certification by a licensed physician that remodeling or conversion of a motor vehicle is necessary
to enable a disabled person to use the vehicle.
    (c) A new motor vehicle dealer shall not deliver a manufacturer's or importer's certificate of
origin for a passenger automobile, pickup truck, or van requiring a certificate of title according
to chapter 168A to any person in conjunction with the sale of a vehicle except to the department,
another new motor vehicle dealer licensed to sell the same line or make, or a person whose primary
business is picking up and delivering motor vehicle title documents.
    (d) If a new motor vehicle dealer agrees to sell or lease a new motor vehicle using the services
of a motor vehicle broker, the new motor vehicle dealer may not refuse to deliver possession of the
vehicle to the buyer or lessee. This paragraph does not require delivery unless all arrangements have
been properly completed for payment, insurance required by law, titling, transfer, and registration
of the new vehicle and any trade-in vehicle. Delivery may take place at or away from the dealership.
   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 168.27, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Used motor vehicle dealer. A used motor vehicle dealer licensee may sell, lease,
broker, wholesale, or auction and solicit and advertise the sale, lease, brokerage, wholesale, or
auction of any used motor vehicles for consumer use at retail or for resale to a dealer. A used motor
vehicle dealer may engage in the business of buying or otherwise acquiring vehicles for dismantling
the vehicles and selling used parts and remaining scrap materials under chapter 168A, except that a
used motor vehicle dealer may not acquire a junked vehicle from a salvage pool, insurance company,
or its agent, unless the dealer is also licensed as a used vehicle parts dealer or licensed as a scrap
metal processor.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 168.27, subdivision 3c, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3c. Vehicle salvage pool. A vehicle salvage pool licensee may store and display and may

solicit and advertise the storing and displaying, for sale, of damaged or junked vehicles as an agent
or escrow agent of an insurance company. A vehicle salvage pool licensee shall not sell junked
vehicles to any party other than a licensed used parts dealer or a licensed scrap metal processor.

restoration; and
   (3) the title must not bear a "reconstructed vehicle" brand.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 168A.09, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4. Restored pioneer vehicle; replacement title. (a) The owner of a vehicle may apply to
the commissioner for a replacement title if:
   (1) a Minnesota title has been issued prior to the effective date of this section; and
   (2) the vehicle meets the requirements for a restored pioneer vehicle under section 168A.01,
subdivision 16a.
     (b) The commissioner shall establish and make publicly available requirements for an
application under this subdivision, and shall make reasonable efforts to minimize burden on the
title applicant. Among the application requirements, a person applying for a replacement title shall
surrender the original title.
    (c) The commissioner shall impose a fee for a replacement title issued under this subdivision
that is equal to the fee for issuing a duplicate certificate of title under section 168A.29. Fee proceeds
must be allocated in the same manner as the fee for a duplicate certificate of title.

   (d) Any official traffic-control device placed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and
purporting to conform to the lawful requirements pertaining to such devices shall be presumed to
comply with the requirements of this chapter, unless the contrary shall be established by competent
evidence.
    (e) A flagger in a designated work zone may stop vehicles and hold vehicles in place until it
is safe for the vehicles to proceed. A person operating a motor vehicle that has been stopped by a
flagger in a designated work zone may proceed after stopping only on instruction by the flagger.
    (f) An overdimensional load escort driver with a certificate issued under section 299D.085, while
acting as a flagger escorting a legal overdimensional load, may stop vehicles and hold vehicles in
place until it is safe for the vehicles to proceed. A person operating a motor vehicle that has been
stopped by an escort driver acting as a flagger may proceed only on instruction by the flagger or a
police officer.
     (g) A person may stop and hold vehicles in place until it is safe for the vehicles to proceed,
if the person: (1) holds a motorcycle road guard certificate issued under section 171.60; (2) meets
the safety and equipment standards for operating under the certificate; and (3) is acting as a flagger
escorting a motorcycle group ride. A flagger operating as provided under this paragraph may direct
operators of motorcycles within a motorcycle group ride or other vehicle traffic, notwithstanding
any contrary indication of a traffic-control device, including stop signs or traffic-control signals. A
person operating a vehicle that has been stopped by a flagger under this paragraph may proceed only
on instruction by the flagger or a police officer.
    (h) A person representing a motorcycle group ride in any city of the first class may no later
than seven days before the ride request of the city's police chief that traffic and traffic signals be
controlled or modified to allow the ride to proceed through a specified route at a specified time
without stopping. The police chief shall no later than three days before the ride notify the organizer
as to whether the city will control traffic as requested at no cost to the organizer. If the city chooses
not to control traffic as requested at no cost to the organizer, traffic may be controlled by persons
authorized under paragraph (g) within the limits of that authority.

Transportation commercial vehicle accident information in connection with federal grant programs
relating to safety.
    (b) Accident reports and data contained in the reports are not discoverable under any provision
of law or rule of court. No report shall be used as evidence in any trial, civil or criminal, or any
action for damages or criminal proceedings arising out of an accident. However, the commissioner
of public safety shall furnish, upon the demand of any person who has or claims to have made a
report or upon demand of any court, a certificate showing that a specified accident report has or
has not been made to the commissioner solely to prove compliance or failure to comply with the
requirements that the report be made to the commissioner.
    (c) Nothing in this subdivision prevents any individual who has made a report under this section
from providing information to any individuals involved in an accident or their representatives
or from testifying in any trial, civil or criminal, arising out of an accident, as to facts within the

commissioner may also furnish an electronic copy of the database of accident records, which must
not contain personal or private data on an individual, to private agencies as provided in paragraph
(g), for not less than the cost of preparing the copies on a bulk basis as provided in section 13.03,
subdivision 3.
    (f) The fees specified in paragraph (e) notwithstanding, the commissioner and law enforcement
agencies shall charge commercial users who request access to response or incident data relating to
accidents a fee not to exceed 50 cents per record. "Commercial user" is a user who in one location
requests access to data in more than five accident reports per month, unless the user establishes
that access is not for a commercial purpose. Of the money collected by the commissioner under
this paragraph, 90 percent must be deposited in the special revenue fund and credited to the driver
services operating account established in section 299A.705 and ten percent must be deposited in the

electronic copy of the accident records database to the public on a case-by-case basis using the
cost-recovery charges provided for under section 13.03, subdivision 3. The database provided
must not contain personal or private data on an individual. However, unless the accident records
database includes the vehicle identification number, the commissioner shall include the vehicle
registration plate number if a private agency certifies and agrees that the agency:
   (1) is in the business of collecting accident and damage information on vehicles;
    (2) will use the vehicle registration plate number only for identifying vehicles that have been
involved in accidents or damaged, to provide this information to persons seeking access to a vehicle's
history and not for identifying individuals or for any other purpose; and
   (3) will be subject to the penalties and remedies under sections 13.08 and 13.09.
   Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.222, subdivision 6, is amended to read:

Safety which is visible from all distances from 100 feet to 600 feet to the rear when directly in front
of lawful lower beams of headlamps on a motor vehicle. No person may operate a bicycle at any time
when there is not sufficient light to render persons and vehicles on the highway clearly discernible
at a distance of 500 feet ahead unless the bicycle or its operator is equipped with reflective surfaces
that shall be visible during the hours of darkness from 600 feet when viewed in front of lawful lower
beams of headlamps on a motor vehicle. The reflective surfaces shall include reflective materials
on each side of each pedal to indicate their presence from the front or the rear and with a minimum
of 20 square inches of reflective material on each side of the bicycle or its operator. Any bicycle
equipped with side reflectors as required by regulations for new bicycles prescribed by the United

reflectorization contained in this subdivision. A bicycle may be equipped with a front lamp that
emits a white flashing signal or a rear lamp that emits a red flashing signal.

that the operator must elevate the hands above the level of the shoulders in order to grasp the normal
steering grip area.
    ­
    (d
     ­­) (e) No person shall operate upon a highway any bicycle which is of such a size as to prevent
the operator from stopping the bicycle, supporting it with at least one foot on the highway surface
and restarting in a safe manner.

The amounts added are rounded to the nearest cent for each axle or axle group. The additional cost
does not apply to paragraph (c), clauses (1) and (3).
For a vehicle found to exceed the appropriate maximum permitted weight, a cost-per-mile fee of 22
cents per ton, or fraction of a ton, over the permitted maximum weight is imposed in addition to the
normal permit fee. Miles must be calculated based on the distance already traveled in the state plus
the distance from the point of detection to a transportation loading site or unloading site within the
state or to the point of exit from the state.
   (f) As an alternative to paragraph (e), an annual permit may be issued for overweight, or oversize
and overweight, mobile cranes; construction equipment, machinery, and supplies; implements of
husbandry; and commercial boat hauling. The fees for the permit are as follows:

If the gross weight of the vehicle is more than 145,000 pounds the permit fee is determined under
paragraph (e).
    (g) For vehicles which exceed the width limitations set forth in section 169.80 by more than 72
inches, an additional cost equal to $120 added to the amount in paragraph (a) when the permit is
issued while seasonal load restrictions pursuant to section 169.87 are in effect.
    (h) $85 for an annual permit to be issued for a period not to exceed 12 months, for
refuse-compactor vehicles that carry a gross weight of not more than: 22,000 pounds on a single
rear axle; 38,000 pounds on a tandem rear axle; or, subject to section 169.828, subdivision 2,
46,000 pounds on a tridem rear axle. A permit issued for up to 46,000 pounds on a tridem rear axle
must limit the gross vehicle weight to not more than 62,000 pounds.
   (i) $300 for a motor vehicle described in section 169.8261. The fee under this paragraph must

or betterment of public land, buildings, and other public improvements of a capital nature. The
legislature has determined that many school transportation infrastructure projects will constitute
betterments and capital improvements within the meaning of the Minnesota Constitution and capital
expenditures under generally accepted accounting principles, and will be financed more efficiently
and economically under this section than by direct appropriations for specific projects.
    Subd. 5. Program administration. (a) The commissioner shall establish general program
requirements and a competitive process for financial assistance, including but not limited to
eligibility requirements for grant recipients and projects; procedures for solicitation of grants;
application requirements; procedures for payment of financial assistance awards; and a schedule
for application, evaluation, and award of financial assistance.
   (b) An application must include:
   (1) a detailed and specific description of the project;
    (2) an estimate, along with necessary supporting evidence, of the total costs for the project and
the allocation of identified and proposed funding sources for the project;
   (3) an assessment of the need for and benefits of the project;
     (4) a resolution adopted by the governing body of the school for which a safe routes to school
grant is requested, certifying that: (i) the governing body of the school supports the project; and
(ii) funds, if any, required to be supplied by the school to complete the project are available and
committed;
    (5) a timeline indicating the major milestones of the project and their anticipated completion
dates; and
   (6) any additional information or material the commissioner prescribes.
    (c) The commissioner shall make reasonable efforts to (1) publicize each solicitation for
applications among all eligible recipients, and (2) provide technical and informational assistance
in creating and submitting applications.
    (d) By January 1, 2013, the commissioner of transportation shall publish and maintain a manual
on the safe routes to school program that assists applicants for and recipients of financial assistance.
The manual must include identification of eligibility and general program requirements, explanation
of the application process, and review of criteria for evaluation of projects.
   Subd. 6. Evaluation criteria. The commissioner shall establish criteria for evaluation of
applications and selection of projects. The criteria must include:
   (1) establishment or capital improvement of transportation infrastructure that improves safety
and encourages nonmotorized transportation to and from a school;
   (2) compliance with all applicable requirements for capital infrastructure projects established by

the Federal Highway Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, for the federal program;
and
   (3) other components as determined by the commissioner.
    Subd. 7. Grant cancellation. If, five years after execution of a grant agreement, the
commissioner determines that the grantee has not proceeded in a timely manner with implementation
of the project funded, the commissioner must cancel the grant and the grantee must repay to the
commissioner all grant money paid to the grantee. Section 16A.642 applies to any appropriations
made from the bond proceeds fund to the commissioner under this section that have not been
awarded as financial assistance.
    Subd. 8. Legislative report. By November 1 annually, the commissioner shall submit a report
on the safe routes to school program to the chairs and ranking minority members of the house of
representatives and senate committees with jurisdiction over transportation policy and finance. The
report must at a minimum:
   (1) summarize program implementation;
   (2) provide an overview of grant evaluation and criteria used in project selection;
   (3) provide a brief description of each project funded in the previous fiscal year, including the
amount of money provided from each safe routes to school account under this section and the amount
provided under the federal program;
   (4) summarize the status of the federal program or successor legislation; and
   (5) identify any recommendations for legislative changes, including proposals to improve
program effectiveness.

    Subd. 3. Licensing requirements. (a) Each design-builder shall employ, or have as a partner,
member, officer, coventurer, or subcontractor, a person duly licensed and registered to provide the
design services required to complete the project and do business in the state, including the provision
of sureties of sufficient amount to protect the interests of the awarding municipality.
    (b) A design-builder may enter into a contract to provide professional or construction services
for a project that the design-builder is not licensed, registered, or qualified to perform, so long as
the design-builder provides those services through subcontractors with duly licensed, registered,
or otherwise qualified individuals in accordance with Minnesota Statutes, sections 161.3410 to
161.3428.
    (c) Nothing in this section authorizing design-build contracts is intended to limit or eliminate the
responsibility or liability owed by a professional on a design-build project to the state, municipality,
or other third party under existing law.
    (d) The design service portion of a design-build contract must be considered a service and not
a product.
    Subd. 4. Information session for municipal engineer. After a project is selected for
participation in the design-build contracting p

designee with design-build experience shall conduct an information session for the municipality's
engineer for each selected project, in which issues unique to design-build must be discussed,
including, but not limited to, writing an RFP, project oversight requirements, assessing risk, and
communication with the design-build firm. After participation in the information session, the
municipality's engineer is qualified to post the selected project, along with any future design-build
project RFP in the p ­­l

    Subd. 5. Technical Review Committee. During the phase one RFQ and before solicitation, the
municipality shall appoint a Technical Review Committee of at least five individuals. The Technical
Review Committee must include an individual whose name and qualifications are submitted to the
municipality by the Minnesota chapter of the Associated General Contractors, after consultation
with other commercial contractor associations in the state. Members of the Technical Review
Committee who are not state employees are subject to the Minnesota Government Data Practices
Act and Minnesota Statutes, section 16C.06, to the same extent that state agencies are subject
to those provisions. A Technical Review Committee member may not participate in the review
or discussion of responses to the RFQ or RFP when a design-build firm in which the member
has a financial interest has responded to the RFQ or RFP. "Financial interest" includes, but is not
limited to, being or serving as an owner, employee, partner, limited liability partner, shareholder,
joint venturer, family member, officer, or director of a design-build firm responding to an RFQ or
RFP for a specific project, or having any other economic interest in that design-build firm. The
members of the Technical Review Committee must be treated as municipal employees in the event

of litigation resulting from any action arising out of their service on the committee.
    Subd. 6. Phase one; design-build RFQ. The municipality shall prepare an RFQ, which must
include the following:
   (1) the minimum qualifications of design-builders necessary to meet the requirements for
acceptance;
   (2) a scope of work statement and schedule;
   (3) documents defining the project requirements;
   (4) the form of contract to be awarded;
    (5) the weighted selection criteria for compiling a short list and the number of firms to be included
in the short list, which must be at least two but not more than five;
   (6) a description of the request for proposals (RFP) requirements;
   (7) the maximum time allowed for design and construction;
   (8) the municipality's estimated cost of design and construction;
    (9) requirements for construction experience, design experience, financial, personnel, and
equipment resources available from potential design-builders for the project and experience in
other design-build transportation projects or similar projects, provided that these requirements may
not unduly restrict competition; and
   (10) a statement that "past performance" or "experience" or other criteria used in the RFQ
evaluation process does not include the exercise or assertion of a person's legal rights.
    Subd. 7. Information session for prospective design-build firms. After a design-build project
is advertised, any prospective design-build firm shall attend a design-build information session
conducted by the commissioner or the commissioner's designee with design-build experience.
The information must include information about design-build contracts, including, but not
limited to, communication with partner firms, project oversight requirements, assessing risk, and
communication with the municipality's engineer. After participation in the information session, the
design-build firm is eligible to bid on the design-build project and any future design-build p­­l
                                                                                                i­o

program projects.
    Subd. 8. Evaluation. The selection team shall evaluate the design-build qualifications of
responding firms and shall compile a short list of no more than five most highly qualified firms in
accordance with qualifications criteria described in the RFQ. If only one design-build firm responds
to the RFQ or remains on the short list, the municipality may readvertise or cancel the project as
the municipality deems necessary.
    Subd. 9. Phase two; design-build RFP. The municipality shall prepare an RFP, which must
include:
   (1) the scope of work, including (i) performance and technical requirements, (ii) conceptual
design, (iii) specifications consistent with state standards and specifications, and (iv) functional and
operational elements for the delivery of the completed project, all of which must be prepared by a

registered or licensed professional engineer;
   (2) copies of the contract documents that the successful proposer will be expected to sign;
   (3) the maximum time allowable for design and construction;
   (4) the road authority's estimated cost of design and construction;
   (5) the requirement that a submitted proposal be segmented into two parts, a technical proposal
and a price proposal;
    (6) the requirement that each proposal be in a separately sealed, clearly identified package and
include the date and time of the submittal deadline;
    (7) the requirement that the technical proposal include a critical path method, bar schedule of the
work to be performed, or similar schematic; preliminary design plans and specifications; technical
reports; calculations; permit requirements; applicable development fees; and other data requested
in the RFP;
    (8) the requirement that the price proposal contain all design, construction, engineering,
inspection, and construction costs of the proposed project;
   (9) the requirement that surety be submitted equal to the total amount of the proposal;
    (10) a description of the qualifications required of the design-builder and the selection criteria,
including the weight of each criterion and subcriterion;
   (11) the date, time, and location of the public opening of the sealed price proposals;
   (12) the amount of, and eligibility for, a stipulated fee;
   (13) other information relevant to the project; and
   (14) a statement that "past performance," "experience," or other criteria used in the RFP
evaluation process does not include the exercise or assertion of a person's legal rights.
   Subd. 10. Design-build award; computation; announcement. A design-build contract shall
be awarded as follows:
    (a) The Technical Review Committee shall score the technical proposals of the proposers
selected under subdivision 8 using the selection criteria in the RFP. The Technical Review
Committee shall then submit a technical proposal score for each design-builder to the municipality.
The Technical Review Committee shall reject any nonresponsive proposal, including those unable
to provide sufficient surety to guarantee project completion. The municipality shall review the
technical proposal scores.
   (b) The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall review the technical proposal scores.
The commissioner shall submit the final technical proposal scores to the municipality.
    (c) The municipality shall announce the technical proposal score for each design-builder and
shall publicly open the sealed price proposals and shall divide each design-builder's price by the
technical score that the commissioner has given to it to obtain an adjusted score. The design-builder
selected must be that responsive and responsible design-builder whose adjusted score is the lowest.
4600                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [88TH DAY

  (d) If a time factor is included with the selection criteria in the RFP package, the municipality
may use a value of the time factor established by the municipality as a criterion in the RFP.
    (e) Unless all proposals are rejected, the municipality shall award the contract to the responsive
and responsible design-builder with the lowest adjusted score. The municipality shall reserve the
right to reject all proposals.
    (f) The municipality shall award a stipulated fee not less than two-tenths of one percent of
the municipality's estimated cost of design and construction to each short-listed, responsible
proposer who provides a responsive but unsuccessful proposal. If the municipality does not award
a contract, all short-listed proposers must receive the stipulated fee. If the municipality cancels the
contract before reviewing the technical proposals, the municipality shall award each design-builder
on the short list a stipulated fee of not less than two-tenths of one percent of the municipality's
estimated cost of design and construction. The municipality shall pay the stipulated fee to each
proposer within 90 days after the award of the contract or the decision not to award a contract.
In consideration for paying the stipulated fee, the municipality may use any ideas or information
contained in the proposals in connection with any contract awarded for the project or in connection
with a subsequent procurement, without any obligation to pay any additional compensation to the
unsuccessful proposers. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subdivision, an unsuccessful
short-list proposer may elect to waive the stipulated fee. If an unsuccessful short-list proposer
elects to waive the stipulated fee, the municipality may not use ideas and information contained in
that proposer's proposal. Upon the request of the municipality, a proposer who waived a stipulated
fee may withdraw the waiver, in which case the municipality shall pay the stipulated fee to the
proposer and thereafter may use ideas and information in the proposer's proposal.
    (g) The municipality shall not limit the ability of design-builders that have submitted
proposals to protest a contemplated or actual award by the commissioner by, among other things,
unreasonably restricting the time to protest; restricting the right to seek judicial review of the
commissioner's actions; attempting to change the judicial standard of review; or requiring the
protestor to pay attorney fees for an unsuccessful, nonfrivolous protest. Unless all design-builders
that have submitted proposals agree to execution of a contract for the project without a waiting
period beforehand, the municipality shall wait at least seven days after both the award of the
project and public disclosure of the Technical Review Committee's scoring data and the successful
proposal before executing a contract for the project.
    Subd. 11. Low-bid design-build process. (a) The municipality may also use low-bid,
design-build procedures to award a design-build contract where the scope of the work can be
clearly defined.
   (b) Low-bid design-build projects may require an RFQ and short-listing, and must require an
RFP.
    (c) Submitted proposals under this subdivision must include separately a technical proposal and
a price proposal. The low-bid, design-build procedures must follow a two-step process for review
of the responses to the RFP as follows:
   (1) the first step is the review of the technical proposal by the Technical Review Committee as
provided in subdivision 5. The Technical Review Committee must open the technical proposal first
and must determine if it complies with the requirements of the RFP and is responsive. The Technical
Review Committee may not perform any ranking or scoring of the technical proposals; and

  (2) the second step is the determination of the low bidder based on the price proposal. The
municipality may not open the price proposal until the review of the technical proposal is complete.
  (d) The contract award under low-bid, design-build procedures must be made to the proposer
whose sealed bid is responsive to the technical requirements as determined by the Technical Review
Committee and that is also the lowest bid.
   (e) A stipulated fee may be paid for unsuccessful bids on low-bid, design-build projects only
when the municipality has required an RFQ and short-listed the most highly qualified responsive
bidders.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and expires
upon completion of nine design-build projects.
    Sec. 58. Laws 2009, chapter 36, article 3, section 29, the effective date, is amended to read:

  Sec. 69. WATER PERMITTING PROCESSES FOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS;
REPORT.
    By November 15, 2012, the commissioners of transportation, natural resources, and the
Pollution Control Agency, in consultation with local road authorities and the Board of Water
and Soil Resources, shall submit recommendations to the house of representatives and senate
committees and divisions with primary jurisdiction over environment and natural resources
policy and finance and transportation policy and finance on how water-related permitting for
transportation projects can best be streamlined through creation of a single point of issuance
system. The recommendations shall specifically:

permits would interact with a single state agency serving as the sole intermediary on behalf of all
state agencies with an interest in a road authority's water permit application;
    (2) provide a goal for the maximum number of days that the state believes are necessary to issue
final water permitting decisions;
  (3) identify how state entities with current oversight authority over water permitting decisions
would allocate resources to accommodate a single point of issuance system; and
    (4) suggest strategies to enhance the coordination of federal and state water permitting

of a portion of the state-owned lands located within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.
The state owns 116,559 acres of land within the wilderness area, 86,295 acres of which are school
trust land.
   (b) Exchange of school trust lands within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness for
federally owned lands located outside the wilderness area will preserve the spectacular wild areas
while producing economic benefits for Minnesota's public schools.
   (c) For land exchanges under this section, sections 94.342 to 94.347 apply only to the extent
specified in this section.
   Subd. 2. Classes of land; definitions. The classes of state land that may be involved in an
expedited exchange under this section are:
   (1) school trust land as defined in section 92.025;
   (2) university land granted to the state by acts of Congress;
    (3) all other lands acquired by the state in any manner and under the control of the commissioner
of natural resources; and

taxing districts, and under the control of county authorities for classification, appraisal, and sale.
   Subd. 3. Valuation of land. (a) In an exchange of school trust land, university land, or other land
under the control of the commissioner of natural resources for land owned by the United States, the
examination and value determination of the land shall be done in a manner as agreed to between the
commissioner and the authorized representative of the United States.

and value determination shall be done in a manner as agreed to between the county board and the
authorized representative of the United States.
     (c) All lands exchanged under this section shall be exchanged only for lands of at least
substantially equal value. For the purposes of this subdivision, "substantially equal value" has the
meaning given under section 94.343, subdivision 3, paragraph (b). No payment is due either party
if the lands are of substantially equal value but are not of the same value.
    Subd. 4. Title. Title to the land must be examined to the extent necessary for the parties to
determine that the title is good, with any encumbrances identified. The parties to the exchange may
use title insurance to aid in the determination.
    Subd. 5. Approval by Land Exchange Board. In accordance with the Minnesota Constitution,
article XI, section 10, all expedited land exchanges under this section require the unanimous
approval of the Land Exchange Board.
    Subd. 6. Conveyance. (a) Conveyance of school trust land, university land, or other land
under the control of the commissioner of natural resources shall be made by deed executed by
the commissioner in the name of the state. Conveyance of tax-forfeited land shall be by a deed
executed by the commissioner of revenue in the name of the state.
    (b) School trust land, university land, and other land under the control of the commissioner of
natural resources and given in exchange is subject to reservations under section 94.343, subdivision
4, and the Minnesota Constitution, article XI, section 10. Tax-forfeited land given in exchange is
subject to reservations under section 94.344, subdivision 4, and the Minnesota Constitution, article
XI, section 10.
   (c) All deeds shall be recorded or registered in the county in which the lands lie.
     Subd. 7. Land status. Land received in exchange for school trust land, university land, or other
land under the control of the commissioner of natural resources is subject to the same trust, if any,
and otherwise has the same status as the land given in exchange. Land received in exchange for
tax-forfeited land is subject to a trust in favor of the governmental subdivision in which it lies and
all laws relating to tax-forfeited land.
