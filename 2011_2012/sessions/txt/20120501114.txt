    Subd. 3. Bridge. "Bridge" is defined as a structure, including supports erected over a depression
or an obstruction, such as water, a highway, or a railway, having a track or passageway for carrying
traffic or other moving loads, and having an opening measured horizontally along the center of the

roadway of ten feet or more between undercopings of abutments, between the spring line of arches,
or between extreme ends of openings for multiple boxes. Bridge also includes multiple pipes where
the clear distance between openings is less than one-half of the smaller contiguous opening. This
definition of a bridge includes only those railroad and pedestrian bridges over a public highway or
street.
    Subd. 4. National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS). "NBIS" means standards established
by the Federal Highway Administration in Code of Federal Regulations, title 23, part 650, subpart
C, incorporated by reference.
   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 165.03, is amended to read:
   165.03 STRENGTH OF BRIDGE; INSPECTION.
    Subdivision 1. Standards generally. Each bridge, including a privately owned bridge, must
conform to the strength, width, clearance, and safety standards imposed by the commissioner for the
connecting highway or street. This subdivision applies to a bridge that is constructed after August
1, 1989, on any public highway or street. The bridge must have sufficient strength to support with
safety the maximum vehicle weights allowed under sections 169.822 to 169.829 and must have the
minimum width specified in section 165.04, subdivision 3.
    Subd. 1a. Inspection. (a) Each bridge must be inspected annually, unless a longer interval not

is authorized by the commissioner. The commissioner's authorization must be based on factors
including, but not limited to, the age and condition of the bridge, the rate of deterioration of the
bridge, the type of structure, the susceptibility of the bridge to failure, and the characteristics of
traffic on the bridge. The commissioner may require interim inspections at intervals of less than one
year on bridges that are posted, bridges subjected to extreme scour conditions, bridges subject to
significant substructure movement or settlement, and for other reasons as specified or inferred in the
AASHTO manual.
   (b) Additional requirements apply to structures meeting the NBIS definition of a bridge:
    (1) Underwater structural elements must be inspected at regular intervals not to exceed 60
months. The commissioner may require inspections at intervals of less than 60 months on certain
underwater structural elements based on factors including, but not limited to, construction material,
the environment, age, the scour characteristics, the condition rating from past inspections, and any
known deficiencies.
    (2) Fracture critical members, or FCMs, must receive a hands-on fracture critical inspection
at intervals not to exceed 24 months. The commissioner may require inspections at intervals of
less than 24 months on certain FCMs based on factors including, but not limited to, age, the traffic
characteristics, and any known deficiencies.
    (3) The commissioner may establish criteria to determine the level and frequency of these
inspections. If warranted by special circumstances, the commissioner retains the authority to
determine the inspection type and required inspection frequency for any bridge on the state
inventory.

characteristics, state of maintenance, and known deficiencies. The evaluation of these factors is the

contain recommendations for the correction of or legal posting of load limitations if the bridge is

   Subd. 6a. Bridge load rating and posting. (a) The term "posting" means the placement of
regulatory signs at a bridge indicating the safe load carrying capacity of the bridge.
    (b) Each structure required to be inspected by subdivision 2, paragraph (a), must be load rated to
determine its safe load carrying capacity, and this rating must be reported on a structure inventory
sheet form provided by the commissioner of transportation. A structure must be rerated when it is
determined that a significant change has occurred in the condition of the structure or due to additional
dead load placed on the structure since the last load rating. Load ratings must be reviewed and the
structure rerated if necessary when the allowable legal load using the structure is increased. Changes
in the load rating of a bridge must be indicated on the structure inventory sheet form.
   (c) Where it is determined that the maximum legal load under state law exceeds the load
permitted on the structure under the operating rating stress level assigned, the bridge must be
posted. Posting signs as adopted by the commissioner shall be used for the posting. The owner
or highway authority shall post the bridge in accordance with the posted load assigned by the
commissioner.
   Subd. 7. Department of Natural Resources bridge. (a) Notwithstanding subdivision 2,
the commissioners of transportation and natural resources shall negotiate a memorandum of
understanding that governs the inspection of bridges owned, operated, or maintained by the
commissioner of natural resources.

    (1) the inspection and inventory of bridges subject to federal law or regulations;
    (2) the frequency of inspection of bridges described in p

    Subd. 8. Biennial report on bridge inspection quality assurance. By February 1 of each
odd-numbered year, the commissioner shall submit a report electronically to the members of the
senate and house of representatives committees with jurisdiction over transportation policy and
finance concerning quality assurance for bridge inspections. At a minimum, the report must:
   (1) summarize the bridge inspection quality assurance and quality control procedures used in
Minnesota;
    (2) identify any substantive changes to quality assurance and quality control procedures made
in the previous two years;
    (3) summarize and provide a briefing on findings from bridge inspection quality reviews
performed in the previous two years;
    (4) identify actions taken and planned in response to findings from bridge inspection quality
reviews performed in the previous two years;
  (5) summarize the results of any bridge inspection compliance review by the Federal Highway
Administration; and
    (6) identify actions in response to the Federal Highway Administration compliance review taken
by the department in order to reach full compliance."
