the management of the school trust lands that shows how the commissioner has and will continue
to achieve the following goals:
    (1) manage the school trust lands efficiently and in a manner that reflects the undivided loyalty
to the beneficiaries consistent with the commissioner's fiduciary duties;

   (2) reduce the management expenditures of school trust lands and maximize the revenues
deposited in the permanent school trust fund;
    (3) manage the sale, exchange, and commercial leasing of school trust lands, requiring returns
of not less than fair market value, to maximize the revenues deposited in the permanent school trust
fund and retain the value from the long-term appreciation of the school trust lands; ­
                                                                                     an

    (4) manage the school trust lands to maximize the long-term economic return for the permanent
school trust fund while maintaining sound natural resource conservation and management
principles;
    (5) optimize school trust land revenues and maximize the value of the trust consistent with the
balancing of short-term and long-term interests, so that long-term benefits are not lost in an effort
to maximize short-term gains; and
   (6) maintain the integrity of the trust and prevent the misapplication of its lands and its revenues.
    (b) When the commissioner finds an irresolvable conflict between maximizing the long-term
economic return and protecting natural resources and recreational values on school trust lands,
the commissioner shall give precedence to the long-term economic return in managing school
trust lands. By July 1, 2018, the permanent school fund shall be compensated for all school trust
lands included under a designation or policy provision that prohibits long-term economic return.
The commissioner shall submit recommendations to the appropriate legislative committees and
divisions on methods of funding for the compensation required under this paragraph, including
recommendations for appropriations from the general fund, nongeneral funds, and the state bond
fund. Any uncompensated designation or policy provision restrictions on the long-term economic
return on school trust lands remaining after July 1, 2018, shall be compiled and submitted to the
Legislative Permanent School Fund Commission for review.
    (c) By December 31, 2013, the report required under paragraph (a) shall provide an inventory
and identification of all school trust lands that are included under a designation or policy provision
that prohibits long-term economic return. The report shall include a plan to compensate the
permanent school fund through the purchase or exchange of the lands or a plan to manage the school
trust land to generate long-term economic return to the permanent school fund. Subsequent reports
under paragraph (a) shall include a status report of the commissioner's progress in maximizing the
long-term economic return on lands identified in the 2013 report.
    (d) When future designations or policies by the commissioner prohibit the long-term economic
return on school trust land, the conflict shall be resolved by compensating the permanent school
fund through an exchange or purchase of the lands before designation or application of the policy.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 92.45, is amended to read:
   92.45 STATE LAND ON MEANDERED LAKES WITHDRAWN FROM SALE.
   All state lands, excluding school trust lands, bordering on or adjacent to meandered lakes
and other public waters and watercourses, with the live timber growing on them, are withdrawn
from sale except as provided in this section. The commissioner of natural resources may sell the
timber as otherwise provided by law for cutting and removal under conditions the commissioner
prescribes. The conditions must be in accordance with approved, sustained-yield forestry practices.
The commissioner must reserve the timber and impose other conditions the commissioner deems

necessary to protect watersheds, wildlife habitat, shorelines, and scenic features. Within the area
in Cook, Lake, and St. Louis Counties described in the Act of Congress approved July 10, 1930,
(Statutes at Large, volume 46, page 1020), the timber on state lands is subject to restrictions like
those now imposed by the act on federal lands.
    The following land is reserved for public travel: of all land bordering on or adjacent to
meandered lakes and other public waters and watercourses and withdrawn from sale, a strip two
rods wide, the ordinary high-water mark being its waterside boundary, and its landside boundary
a line drawn parallel to the ordinary high-water mark and two rods distant landward from it.
Wherever the conformation of the shore line or conditions require, the commissioner must reserve
a wider strip.
    Except for sales under section 282.018, subdivision 1, when a state agency or any other unit of
government requests the legislature to authorize the sale of state lands bordering on or adjacent
to meandered lakes and other public waters and watercourses, the commissioner shall evaluate
the lands and their public benefits and make recommendations on the proposed dispositions to
the committees of the legislature with jurisdiction over natural resources. The commissioner
shall include any recommendations of the commissioner for disposition of lands withdrawn
from sale under this section over which the commissioner has jurisdiction. The commissioner's
recommendations may include a public sale, sale to a private party, acquisition by the commissioner
for public purposes, retention of a conservation easement for shoreland preservation by the
commissioner under chapter 84C, or a cooperative management agreement with, or transfer to,
another unit of government.
   The commissioner may sell state lands bordering on or adjacent to the Mississippi River or
any lakes, waters, and watercourses in its bottom lands, desired or needed by the United States
government for, or in connection with, any project heretofore authorized by Congress, to improve
navigation in the Mississippi River at public sale according to law, as in other cases, upon application
by an authorized United States official. The application must describe the land and include a map
showing its location with reference to adjoining properties.

    Sec. 8. [127A.351] POLICY AND PURPOSE.
    (a) The purpose of sections 127A.351 to 127A.353 is to establish a school trust lands director
position to recommend management policies for Minnesota's school trust lands in accordance with
the provisions of the Minnesota Constitution, article XI, section 8.
    (b) As trustee, the state must manage the lands and revenues generated from the lands consistent
with the best interests of the trust beneficiaries as defined in the Minnesota Constitution, article XI,
section 8. When it is in the best interest of the school trust lands, ecological benefits shall be taken
into consideration.
   (c) The trustee must be concerned with both income for the current beneficiaries and the
preservation of trust assets for future beneficiaries, which requires a balancing of short-term and
long-term interests so that long-term benefits are not lost in an effort to maximize short-term gains.
    (d) Sections 127A.351 to 127A.353 shall be liberally construed to enable the school trust lands
director and the commissioner of natural resources to faithfully fulfill the state's obligations to the
trust beneficiaries.

109TH DAY]                       WEDNESDAY, APRIL 25, 2012                                     6493

   (7) to employ and supervise personnel under this chapter;
   (8) to determine the number of racing days to be held in the state and at each licensed racetrack;

                                                                                    ­d­
    (10) to impose fees on the racing and card playing industries sufficient to recover the operating
costs of the commission with the approval of the legislature according to section 16A.1283.
Notwithstanding section 16A.1283, when the legislature is not in session, the commissioner of
management and budget may grant interim approval for any new fees or adjustments to existing
fees that are not statutorily specified, until such time as the legislature reconvenes and acts upon
the new fees or adjustments. As part of its biennial budget request, the commission must propose
changes to its fees that will be sufficient to recover the operating costs of the commission; and
    (11) to take all necessary steps to ensure the security of all activities in a class A licensed
racetrack. The duties and responsibilities of the commission include but are not limited to licensing
employees of a class A licensee and vendors to the class A licensee involved in the conduct of
gaming machines authorized by a location contract with the director of the State Lottery under
section 349A.17 and overall surveillance and security of all conduct on all facilities of a licensed
racetrack. The commission shall require that a class A licensed racetrack reimburse it for the
commission's actual costs, including personnel costs, for conducting activities provided in this
clause and amounts received must be deposited as provided in section 240.155, subdivision 1. The
commission shall review procedures of the class A licensee to ensure compliance with section
240.13, subdivision 5a.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 240.13, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5a. Equine industry improvement fund. (a) To compensate the horse racing industry for
the presence of lottery gaming machines at class A racing facilities, the commission shall establish
and maintain an equine industry improvement fund. Each licensee holding a location contract with
the lottery director shall, as directed by the commission, transmit an amount equal to 12 percent of
the location contract compensation received from the lottery director to the commission for deposit
into the equine industry improvement fund. Seventy-five percent of the funds shall be allocated
for purse supplements. The commission shall routinely transfer 80 percent of the fund allocated
for purse supplements to a licensee conducting live racing for more than one breed of horse and
20 percent to a licensee conducting live racing for only one breed of horse and direct the licensee
to use the funds to supplement purses offered for live races. Purse supplements required under this
subdivision are in addition to purse payments otherwise established by law or contract. The location
contract holder and the organization representing the majority of horsepersons racing at the location
contract holder's racetrack may, by written contract, agree to use a portion of the transferred funds
for racing-related purposes other than purse supplementation.

    (b) The commission shall allocate 20 percent of the fund for breeder's fund purposes and shall
transmit that amount to the breeder's fund for the benefit of each breed racing at a class A licensed
facility hosting lottery gaming machines. Amounts transferred shall be in the same proportions
established, under this subdivision, for purse supplements. Amounts transferred to a breeder's fund
shall be used for the purposes of section 240.18, subdivisions 2, paragraph (d), and 3, paragraph (b),
subject to the proportionality requirement in section 240.18, subdivision 1.
    (c) Five percent of the fund shall be placed in an equine industry enhancement fund established
by the commission. The commission shall award grants from this account designed to support and
improve the nonracing equine industry including, but not limited to, construction of facilities and
trails, production of shows, and issues related to retired horses.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 240.14, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Lottery contract holder; minimum racing days. Licensees holding location contracts
with the director of the lottery, who are authorized to conduct live racing for more than one breed
of horse, shall conduct thoroughbred and quarter horse racing. In any year the licensee shall offer
the equivalent of at least two quarter horse races for each racing day granted to the licensee by the
commission, however, the licensee and the organization representing the majority of quarter horses
owners licensed to race in the state may agree to a different number of live races to be offered.
Scheduling of quarter horse races shall be as approved by the commission pursuant to section 240.03,
clause (8). Willful failure to offer the races required by this subdivision shall subject the licensee to
disciplinary action as deemed appropriate by the commission.
   Sec. 5. [297A.651] LOTTERY GAMING MACHINES; IN-LIEU FEE.
    Adjusted gross revenue from the operation of gaming machines authorized under chapter 349A
is exempt from the tax imposed under section 297A.62 and chapter 297E and any other tax, license,
permit, or assessment for conducting a gambling activity that is not imposed by this section. The
State Lottery must, on or before the 20th day of each month, transmit to the commissioner an amount
equal to the adjusted gross gaming machine revenue from the operation of gaming machines, as
defined in section 349A.01, for the previous month multiplied by: (1) 25 percent of annual adjusted
gross gaming machine revenue generated by each person that has a location contract under section
