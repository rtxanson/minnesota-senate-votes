designate a member of the unitary business to be responsible for tax matters, including the filing of
returns, the payment of taxes, additions to tax, penalties, interest, or any other payment, and for the
receipt of refunds of taxes or interest paid in excess of taxes lawfully due. The designated member
must be a member of the unitary business that is filing the single combined report and either:
    (1) a corporation that is subject to the taxes imposed by chapter 290; or

subject to tax, and receive refunds or other payments on behalf of other members of the unitary
business. The member designated under this clause is a "taxpayer" for the purposes of this chapter
and chapter 270C, and is liable for any liability imposed on the unitary business under this chapter
and chapter 290.
    (ii) If the state does not otherwise have the jurisdiction to tax the member designated under this
clause, consenting to be the designated member does not create the jurisdiction to impose tax on the
designated member, other than as described in item (i).
   (iii) The member designated under this clause must apply for a business tax account identification
number.
    (c) The commissioner shall adopt rules for the filing of one return on behalf of the members
of an affiliated group of corporations that are required to file a combined report. All members of
an affiliated group that are required to file a combined report must file one return on behalf of the
members of the group under rules adopted by the commissioner.
   (d) If a corporation claims on a return that it has paid tax in excess of the amount of taxes lawfully
due, that corporation must include on that return information necessary for payment of the tax in
excess of the amount lawfully due by electronic means.

   "Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290.0921, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Alternative minimum taxable income. "Alternative minimum taxable income" is
Minnesota net income as defined in section 290.01, subdivision 19, and includes the adjustments
and tax preference items in sections 56, 57, 58, and 59(d), (e), (f), and (h) of the Internal Revenue
Code. If a corporation files a separate company Minnesota tax return, the minimum tax must be
computed on a separate company basis. If a corporation is part of a tax group filing a unitary return,
the minimum tax must be computed on a unitary basis. The following adjustments must be made.
    (1) For purposes of the depreciation adjustments under section 56(a)(1) and 56(g)(4)(A) of
the Internal Revenue Code, the basis for depreciable property placed in service in a taxable year
beginning before January 1, 1990, is the adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes, including
any modification made in a taxable year under section 290.01, subdivision 19e, or Minnesota
Statutes 1986, section 290.09, subdivision 7, paragraph (c).
   For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, the amount of any remaining modification
made under section 290.01, subdivision 19e, or Minnesota Statutes 1986, section 290.09,
subdivision 7, paragraph (c), not previously deducted is a depreciation allowance in the first taxable
year after December 31, 2000.

    (2) The portion of the depreciation deduction allowed for federal income tax purposes under

subdivision 19c, clause (15), is disallowed in determining alternative minimum taxable income.

    (4) The alternative tax net operating loss deduction under sections 56(a)(4) and 56(d) of the
Internal Revenue Code does not apply.
   (5) The special rule for certain dividends under section 56(g)(4)(C)(ii) of the Internal Revenue
Code does not apply.

Revenue Code, the deduction allowable for the taxable year is the deduction allowed under section
290.01, subdivision 19e.
  For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, the amount of any remaining modification
made under section 290.01, subdivision 19e, not previously deducted is a depreciation or
amortization allowance in the first taxable year after December 31, 2004.
    (12) For purposes of calculating the adjustment for adjusted current earnings in section 56(g) of
the Internal Revenue Code, the term "alternative minimum taxable income" as it is used in section
56(g) of the Internal Revenue Code, means alternative minimum taxable income as defined in this
subdivision, determined without regard to the adjustment for adjusted current earnings in section
56(g) of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (13) For purposes of determining the amount of adjusted current earnings under section 56(g)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code, no adjustment shall be made under section 56(g)(4) of the Internal
Revenue Code with respect to (i) the amount of foreign dividend gross-up subtracted as provided
in section 290.01, subdivision 19d, clause (1), or (ii) the amount of refunds of income, excise, or

   Items of tax preference must not be reduced below zero as a result of the modifications in this
subdivision.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable year beginning after December 31,
2011.
   Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290.17, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Unitary business principle. (a) If a trade or business conducted wholly within this
state or partly within and partly without this state is part of a unitary business, the entire income
of the unitary business is subject to apportionment pursuant to section 290.191. Notwithstanding
subdivision 2, paragraph (c), none of the income of a unitary business is considered to be derived
from any particular source and none may be allocated to a particular place except as provided by
the applicable apportionment formula. The provisions of this subdivision do not apply to business
income subject to subdivision 5, income of an insurance company, or income of an investment
company determined under section 290.36.
    (b) The term "unitary business" means business activities or operations which result in a flow of
value between them. The term may be applied within a single legal entity or between multiple entities
and without regard to whether each entity is a sole proprietorship, a corporation, a partnership or a
trust.
    (c) Unity is presumed whenever there is unity of ownership, operation, and use, evidenced by
centralized management or executive force, centralized purchasing, advertising, accounting, or other
controlled interaction, but the absence of these centralized activities will not necessarily evidence
a nonunitary business. Unity is also presumed when business activities or operations are of mutual
benefit, dependent upon or contributory to one another, either individually or as a group.
    (d) Where a business operation conducted in Minnesota is owned by a business entity that carries
on business activity outside the state different in kind from that conducted within this state, and the
other business is conducted entirely outside the state, it is presumed that the two business operations
are unitary in nature, interrelated, connected, and interdependent unless it can be shown to the
contrary.
    (e) Unity of ownership is not deemed to exist when a corporation is involved unless that
corporation is a member of a group of two or more business entities and more than 50 percent
of the voting stock of each member of the group is directly or indirectly owned by a common
owner or by common owners, either corporate or noncorporate, or by one or more of the member
corporations of the group. For this purpose, the term "voting stock" shall include membership
interests of mutual insurance holding companies formed under section 66A.40.
   (f) The net income and apportionment factors under section 290.191 or 290.20 of foreign

corporations and other foreign entities which are part of a unitary business shall not be included
in the net income or the apportionment factors of the unitary business. A foreign corporation or
other foreign entity which is required to file a return under this chapter shall file on a separate
return basis. T ­h­­en­­ e­ i­­

made in that state.
   (e) Sales made by or through a corporation that is qualified as a domestic international sales
corporation under section 992 of the Internal Revenue Code are not considered to have been made
within this state.
    (f) Sales, rents, royalties, and other income in connection with real property is attributed to the
state in which the property is located.
    (g) Receipts from the lease or rental of tangible personal property, including finance leases and
true leases, must be attributed to this state if the property is located in this state and to other states
if the property is not located in this state. Receipts from the lease or rental of moving property
including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, rolling stock, aircraft, vessels, or mobile equipment
are included in the numerator of the receipts factor to the extent that the property is used in this state.
The extent of the use of moving property is determined as follows:
   (1) A motor vehicle is used wholly in the state in which it is registered.
    (2) The extent that rolling stock is used in this state is determined by multiplying the receipts
from the lease or rental of the rolling stock by a fraction, the numerator of which is the miles traveled
within this state by the leased or rented rolling stock and the denominator of which is the total miles
traveled by the leased or rented rolling stock.
    (3) The extent that an aircraft is used in this state is determined by multiplying the receipts from
the lease or rental of the aircraft by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of landings of
the aircraft in this state and the denominator of which is the total number of landings of the aircraft.
    (4) The extent that a vessel, mobile equipment, or other mobile property is used in the state is
determined by multiplying the receipts from the lease or rental of the property by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days during the taxable year the property was in this state and
the denominator of which is the total days in the taxable year.
     (h) Royalties and other income not described in paragraph (a), clause (6), received for the use
of or for the privilege of using intangible property, including patents, know-how, formulas, designs,
processes, patterns, copyrights, trade names, service names, franchises, licenses, contracts, customer
lists, or similar items, must be attributed to the state in which the property is used by the purchaser.
If the property is used in more than one state, the royalties or other income must be apportioned
to this state pro rata according to the portion of use in this state. If the portion of use in this state
cannot be determined, the royalties or other income must be excluded from both the numerator and
the denominator. Intangible property is used in this state if the purchaser uses the intangible property
or the rights therein in the regular course of its business operations in this state, regardless of the
location of the purchaser's customers.
    (i) Sales of intangible property are made within the state in which the property is used by the
purchaser. If the property is used in more than one state, the sales must be apportioned to this state
pro rata according to the portion of use in this state. If the portion of use in this state cannot be
determined, the sale must be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator of the sales
factor. Intangible property is used in this state if the purchaser used the intangible property in the

regular course of its business operations in this state.
    (j) Receipts from the performance of services must be attributed to the state where the services
are received. For the purposes of this section, receipts from the performance of services provided
to a corporation, partnership, or trust may only be attributed to a state where it has a fixed place of
doing business. If the state where the services are received is not readily determinable or is a state
where the corporation, partnership, or trust receiving the service does not have a fixed place of doing
business, the services shall be deemed to be received at the location of the office of the customer
from which the services were ordered in the regular course of the customer's trade or business. If
the ordering office cannot be determined, the services shall be deemed to be received at the office
of the customer to which the services are billed.
    (k) For the purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 6, paragraph (l), receipts from
management, distribution, or administrative services performed by a corporation or trust for a fund
of a corporation or trust regulated under United States Code, title 15, sections 80a-1 through 80a-64,
must be attributed to the state where the shareholder of the fund resides. Under this paragraph,
receipts for services attributed to shareholders are determined on the basis of the ratio of: (1) the
average of the outstanding shares in the fund owned by shareholders residing within Minnesota
at the beginning and end of each year; and (2) the average of the total number of outstanding
shares in the fund at the beginning and end of each year. Residence of the shareholder, in the case
of an individual, is determined by the mailing address furnished by the shareholder to the fund.
Residence of the shareholder, when the shares are held by an insurance company as a depositor for
the insurance company policyholders, is the mailing address of the policyholders. In the case of an
insurance company holding the shares as a depositor for the insurance company policyholders, if
the mailing address of the policyholders cannot be determined by the taxpayer, the receipts must be
excluded from both the numerator and denominator. Residence of other shareholders is the mailing
address of the shareholder.

2011.

racetrack. The duties and responsibilities of the commission include but are not limited to licensing
employees of a class A licensee and vendors to the class A licensee involved in the conduct of
gaming machines authorized by a location contract with the director of the State Lottery under
section 349A.17 and overall surveillance and security of all conduct on all facilities of a licensed
racetrack. The commission shall require that a class A licensed racetrack reimburse it for the
commission's actual costs, including personnel costs, for conducting activities provided in this
clause and amounts received must be deposited as provided in section 240.155, subdivision 1. The
commission shall review procedures of the class A licensee to ensure compliance with section

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 240.13, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5a. Equine industry improvement fund. (a) To compensate the horse racing industry for
the presence of lottery gaming machines at class A racing facilities, the commission shall establish
and maintain an equine industry improvement fund. Each licensee holding a location contract with
the lottery director shall, as directed by the commission, transmit an amount equal to 12 percent of
the location contract compensation received from the lottery director to the commission for deposit
into the equine industry improvement fund. Seventy-five percent of the funds shall be allocated
for purse supplements. The commission shall routinely transfer 80 percent of the fund allocated
for purse supplements to a licensee conducting live racing for more than one breed of horse and
20 percent to a licensee conducting live racing for only one breed of horse and direct the licensee
to use the funds to supplement purses offered for live races. Purse supplements required under this
subdivision are in addition to purse payments otherwise established by law or contract. The location
contract holder and the organization representing the majority of horsepersons racing at the location
contract holder's racetrack may, by written contract, agree to use a portion of the transferred funds
for racing-related purposes other than purse supplementation.
    (b) The commission shall allocate 20 percent of the fund for breeder's fund purposes and shall
transmit that amount to the breeder's fund for the benefit of each breed racing at a class A licensed
facility hosting lottery gaming machines. Amounts transferred shall be in the same proportions
established, under this subdivision, for purse supplements. Amounts transferred to a breeder's fund
shall be used for the purposes of section 240.18, subdivisions 2, paragraph (d), and 3, paragraph (b),
subject to the proportionality requirement in section 240.18, subdivision 1.
    (c) Five percent of the fund shall be placed in an equine industry enhancement fund established
by the commission. The commission shall award grants from this account designed to support and
improve the nonracing equine industry including, but not limited to, construction of facilities and
trails, production of shows, and issues related to retired horses.

commission, however, the licensee and the organization representing the majority of quarter horses
owners licensed to race in the state may agree to a different number of live races to be offered.
Scheduling of quarter horse races shall be as approved by the commission pursuant to section 240.03,
clause (8). Willful failure to offer the races required by this subdivision shall subject the licensee to
disciplinary action as deemed appropriate by the commission.
   Sec. 5. [297A.651] LOTTERY GAMING MACHINES; IN-LIEU FEE.
    Adjusted gross revenue from the operation of gaming machines authorized under chapter 349A
is exempt from the tax imposed under section 297A.62 and chapter 297E and any other tax, license,
permit, or assessment for conducting a gambling activity that is not imposed by this section. The
State Lottery must, on or before the 20th day of each month, transmit to the commissioner an amount
equal to the adjusted gross gaming machine revenue from the operation of gaming machines, as
defined in section 349A.01, for the previous month multiplied by: (1) 25 percent of annual adjusted
gross gaming machine revenue generated by each person that has a location contract under section
349A.17, subdivision 1, up to $150,000,000; (2) 30 percent of annual adjusted gross gaming machine
revenue generated by each person that has a location contract under section 349A.17, subdivision

machine revenue generated by each person that has a location contract under section 349A.17,
subdivision 1, in excess of $200,000,000. The commissioner shall deposit the money transmitted

revenue" means the sum of all money received by the lottery for gaming machine plays, other than
promotional plays, less the amount paid out in prizes for gaming machine games.

insertion of money, coin, token, voucher, electronic card, or other consideration, allows the play
of a game, authorized by the director, the outcome of which is determined entirely or partly by

that the state will not meet the TANF work
