   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 121A.17, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Screening program. (a) A screening program must include at least the following
components: developmental assessments, hearing and vision screening or referral, immunization
review and referral, the child's height and weight, identification of risk factors that may influence
learning, an interview with the parent about the child, and referral for assessment, diagnosis, and
treatment when potential needs are identified. The district and the person performing or supervising
the screening must provide a parent or guardian with clear written notice that the parent or guardian
may decline to answer questions or provide information about family circumstances that might
affect development and identification of risk factors that may influence learning. The notice must
state "Early childhood developmental screening helps a school district identify children who
3844                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [75TH DAY

may benefit from district and community resources available to help in their development. Early
childhood developmental screening includes a vision screening that helps detect potential eye
problems but is not a substitute for a comprehensive eye exam." The notice must clearly state that
declining to answer questions or provide information does not prevent the child from being enrolled
in kindergarten or first grade if all other screening components are met. If a parent or guardian
is not able to read and comprehend the written notice, the district and the person performing or
supervising the screening must convey the information in another manner. The notice must also
inform the parent or guardian that a child need not submit to the district screening program if the
child's health records indicate to the school that the child has received comparable developmental
screening performed within the preceding 365 days by a public or private health care organization
or individual health care provider. The notice must be given to a parent or guardian at the time the
district initially provides information to the parent or guardian about screening and must be given
again at the screening location.
    (b) All screening components shall be consistent with the standards of the state commissioner
of health for early developmental screening programs. A developmental screening program must
not provide laboratory tests or a physical examination to any child. The district must request from
the public or private health care organization or the individual health care provider the results of
any laboratory test or physical examination within the 12 months preceding a child's scheduled
screening.
   (c) If a child is without health coverage, the school district must refer the child to an appropriate
health care provider.
    (d) A board may offer additional components such as nutritional, physical and dental
assessments, review of family circumstances that might affect development, blood pressure,
laboratory tests, and health history.
   (e) If a statement signed by the child's parent or guardian is submitted to the administrator or
other person having general control and supervision of the school that the child has not been screened
because of conscientiously held beliefs of the parent or guardian, the screening is not required.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
new written notices printed after that date."
   Amend the title as follows:
    Page 1, line 2, delete "recommending comprehensive eye exams" and insert "modifying notice
for early childhood developmental screening"

a vulnerable adult is guilty of a gross misdemeanor. For purposes of this section, "abuse" has the

vulnerable adult with necessary food, clothing, shelter, health care, or supervision.
    Subd. 1a. Felony deprivation. A caregiver or operator who intentionally deprives a vulnerable
adult of necessary food, clothing, shelter, health care, or supervision, when the caregiver or operator
is reasonably able to make the necessary provisions is guilty of a felony and may be sentenced as
provided in subdivision 2a, if:
   (1) the caregiver or operator knows or has reason to know the deprivation could likely result in
substantial bodily harm or great bodily harm to the vulnerable adult; or
   (2) the deprivation occurred over an extended period of time.
    Subd. 2. Exemptions. A vulnerable adult is not neglected or deprived under subdivision 1 or 1a
for the sole reason that:
    (1) the vulnerable adult or a person with authority to make health care decisions for the
vulnerable adult under sections 144.651, 144A.44, 253B.03, or 524.5-101 to 524.5-502, or chapter

   (i) a vulnerable adult or a person acting on behalf of a vulnerable adult, including an involved
family member, to consent to or refuse consent for therapeutic conduct; or
   (ii) a caregiver to offer or provide or refuse to offer or provide therapeutic conduct;
    (2) the vulnerable adult, a person with authority to make health care decisions for the vulnerable
adult, or a caregiver in good faith selects and depends upon spiritual means or prayer for treatment
or care of disease or remedial care of the vulnerable adult in lieu of medical care, provided that this
is consistent with the prior practice or belief of the vulnerable adult or with the expressed intentions
of the vulnerable adult; or
    (3) the vulnerable adult, who is not impaired in judgment or capacity by mental or emotional
dysfunction or undue influence, engages in consensual sexual contact with: (i) a person including a
facility staff person when a consensual sexual personal relationship existed prior to the caregiving
relationship; or (ii) a personal care attendant, regardless of whether the consensual sexual personal
relationship existed prior to the caregiving relationship.
   Subd. 2a. Penalties. A person who violates subdivision 1a may be sentenced as follows:
   (1) if the conduct results in great bodily harm to the vulnerable adult, imprisonment for not more
than ten years or payment of a fine of not more than $10,000, or both; and
    (2) if the conduct results in substantial bodily harm to the vulnerable adult, imprisonment for
not more than five years or payment of a fine of not more than $5,000, or both.
   Subd. 2b. Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to a prosecution under
subdivision 1 or 1a, if proven by a preponderance of evidence, that:
   (1) the defendant is an individual employed by a facility or operator and does not have
managerial or supervisory authority, and was unable to reasonably make the necessary provisions
due to inadequate staffing levels, inadequate supervision, or institutional policies;
    (2) the defendant is a facility, an operator, or an employee of a facility or operator in a position
of managerial or supervisory authority, and did not knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly permit
criminal acts by its employees or agents that resulted in the harm to the vulnerable adult; or
    (3) the defendant is a caregiver and failed to perform acts necessary to prevent the applicable
level of harm, if any, to the vulnerable adult because the caregiver was acting reasonably and
necessarily to provide care to another identified vulnerable adult.

on or after that date."
