   "Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.13, subdivision 22, is amended to read:
    Subd. 22. Class 1. (a) Except as provided in subdivision 23 and in paragraphs (b) and (c), real
estate which is residential and used for homestead purposes is class 1a. In the case of a duplex or
triplex in which one of the units is used for homestead purposes, the entire property is deemed to
be used for homestead purposes. The market value of class 1a property must be determined based
upon the value of the house, garage, and land.
   The first $500,000 of market value of class 1a property has a net class rate of one percent of its
market value; and the market value of class 1a property that exceeds $500,000 has a class rate of

1.25 percent of its market value.
    (b) Class 1b property includes homestead real estate or homestead manufactured homes used
for the purposes of a homestead by:
   (1) any person who is blind as defined in section 256D.35, or the blind person and the blind
person's spouse;
   (2) any person who is permanently and totally disabled or by the disabled person and the disabled
person's spouse; or
    (3) the surviving spouse of a permanently and totally disabled veteran homesteading a property
classified under this paragraph for taxes payable in 2008.
    Property is classified and assessed under clause (2) only if the government agency or
income-providing source certifies, upon the request of the homestead occupant, that the homestead
occupant satisfies the disability requirements of this paragraph, and that the property is not eligible
for the valuation exclusion under subdivision 34.
    Property is classified and assessed under paragraph (b) only if the commissioner of revenue or
the county assessor certifies that the homestead occupant satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.
    Permanently and totally disabled for the purpose of this subdivision means a condition which
is permanent in nature and totally incapacitates the person from working at an occupation which
brings the person an income. The first $50,000 market value of class 1b property has a net class rate
of .45 percent of its market value. The remaining market value of class 1b property has a class rate
using the rates for class 1a or class 2a property, whichever is appropriate, of similar market value.
     (c) Class 1c property is commercial use real and personal property that abuts public water as
defined in section 103G.005, subdivision 15, and is devoted to temporary and seasonal residential
occupancy for recreational purposes but not devoted to commercial purposes for more than 250 days
in the year preceding the year of assessment, and that includes a portion used as a homestead by the
owner, which includes a dwelling occupied as a homestead by a shareholder of a corporation that
owns the resort, a partner in a partnership that owns the resort, or a member of a limited liability
company that owns the resort even if the title to the homestead is held by the corporation, partnership,
or limited liability company. For purposes of this paragraph, property is devoted to a commercial
purpose on a specific day if any portion of the property, excluding the portion used exclusively as a
homestead, is used for residential occupancy and a fee is charged for residential occupancy. Class 1c
property must contain three or more rental units. A "rental unit" is defined as a cabin, condominium,
townhouse, sleeping room, or individual camping site equipped with water and electrical hookups
for recreational vehicles. Class 1c property must provide recreational activities such as the rental
of ice fishing houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski equipment;
provide marina services, launch services, or guide services; or sell bait and fishing tackle. Any unit
in which the right to use the property is transferred to an individual or entity by deeded interest,
or the sale of shares or stock, no longer qualifies for class 1c even though it may remain available
for rent. A camping pad offered for rent by a property that otherwise qualifies for class 1c is also
class 1c, regardless of the term of the rental agreement, as long as the use of the camping pad does
not exceed 250 days. ­     I­  ­­o

      e­t­; for purposes of this sentence, properties are deemed to be owned by the same owner if each
       r­y
of them is owned by a limited liability company, and both limited liability companies have the same
membership. The portion of the property used as a homestead is class 1a property under paragraph
(a). The remainder of the property is classified as follows: the first $600,000 of market value is tier
I, the next $1,700,000 of market value is tier II, and any remaining market value is tier III. The class
rates for class 1c are: tier I, 0.50 percent; tier II, 1.0 percent; and tier III, 1.25 percent. Owners of
real and personal property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation
purposes in which all or a portion of the property was devoted to commercial purposes for not more
than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment desiring classification as class 1c, must
submit a declaration to the assessor designating the cabins or units occupied for 250 days or less
in the year preceding the year of assessment by January 15 of the assessment year. Those cabins or
units and a proportionate share of the land on which they are located must be designated as class 1c
as otherwise provided. The remainder of the cabins or units and a proportionate share of the land on
which they are located must be designated as class 3a commercial. The owner of property desiring
designation as class 1c property must provide guest registers or other records demonstrating that
the units for which class 1c designation is sought were not occupied for more than 250 days in the
year preceding the assessment if so requested. The portion of a property operated as a (1) restaurant,
(2) bar, (3) gift shop, (4) conference center or meeting room, and (5) other nonresidential facility
operated on a commercial basis not directly related to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy
for recreation purposes does not qualify for class 1c.
      (d) Class 1d property includes structures that meet all of the following criteria:
   (1) the structure is located on property that is classified as agricultural property under section
273.13, subdivision 23;
   (2) the structure is occupied exclusively by seasonal farm workers during the time when they
work on that farm, and the occupants are not charged rent for the privilege of occupying the property,
provided that use of the structure for storage of farm equipment and produce does not disqualify the
property from classification under this paragraph;
      (3) the structure meets all applicable health and safety requirements for the appropriate season;
and
   (4) the structure is not salable as residential property because it does not comply with local
ordinances relating to location in relation to streets or roads.
   The market value of class 1d property has the same class rates as class 1a property under
paragraph (a).

2011, chapter 8, section 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 19a. Additions to federal taxable income. For individuals, estates, and trusts, there shall
be added to federal taxable income:
   (1)(i) interest income on obligations of any state other than Minnesota or a political or
governmental subdivision, municipality, or governmental agency or instrumentality of any state
other than Minnesota exempt from federal income taxes under the Internal Revenue Code or any
other federal statute; and
   (ii) exempt-interest dividends as defined in section 852(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code,
except:
    (A) the portion of the exempt-interest dividends exempt from state taxation under the laws of
the United States; and
    (B) the portion of the exempt-interest dividends derived from interest income on obligations of
the state of Minnesota or its political or governmental subdivisions, municipalities, governmental
agencies or instrumentalities, but only if the portion of the exempt-interest dividends from such
Minnesota sources paid to all shareholders represents 95 percent or more of the exempt-interest
dividends, including any dividends exempt under subitem (A), that are paid by the regulated
investment company as defined in section 851(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the fund of the
regulated investment company as defined in section 851(g) of the Internal Revenue Code, making
the payment; and
    (iii) for the purposes of items (i) and (ii), interest on obligations of an Indian tribal government
described in section 7871(c) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be treated as interest income on
obligations of the state in which the tribe is located;
    (2) the amount of income, sales and use, motor vehicle sales, or excise taxes paid or accrued
within the taxable year under this chapter and the amount of taxes based on net income paid, sales
and use, motor vehicle sales, or excise taxes paid to any other state or to any province or territory of
Canada, to the extent allowed as a deduction under section 63(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, but
the addition may not be more than the amount by which the itemized deductions as allowed under
section 63(d) of the Internal Revenue Code exceeds the amount of the standard deduction as defined
in section 63(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, disregarding the amounts allowed under sections
63(c)(1)(C) and 63(c)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code. For the purpose of this paragraph, the
disallowance of itemized deductions under section 68 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, income,
sales and use, motor vehicle sales, or excise taxes are the last itemized deductions disallowed;
   (3) the capital gain amount of a lump-sum distribution to which the special tax under section
1122(h)(3)(B)(ii) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Public Law 99-514, applies;
    (4) the amount of income taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year under this chapter and
taxes based on net income paid to any other state or any province or territory of Canada, to the
extent allowed as a deduction in determining federal adjusted gross income. For the purpose of
this paragraph, income taxes do not include the taxes imposed by sections 290.0922, subdivision 1,
paragraph (b), 290.9727, 290.9728, and 290.9729;
   (5) the amount of expense, interest, or taxes disallowed pursuant to section 290.10 other than
expenses or interest used in computing net interest income for the subtraction allowed under

Internal Revenue Code;
    (7) 80 percent of the depreciation deduction allowed under section 168(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code. For purposes of this clause, if the taxpayer has an activity that in the taxable year
generates a deduction for depreciation under section 168(k) and the activity generates a loss for the
taxable year that the taxpayer is not allowed to claim for the taxable year, "the depreciation allowed
under section 168(k)" for the taxable year is limited to excess of the depreciation claimed by the
activity under section 168(k) over the amount of the loss from the activity that is not allowed in
the taxable year. In succeeding taxable years when the losses not allowed in the taxable year are
allowed, the depreciation under section 168(k) is allowed;
   (8) 80 percent of the amount by which the deduction allowed by section 179 of the Internal
Revenue Code exceeds the deduction allowable by section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended through December 31, 2003;

allowable under section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code;

amount deducted for qualified tuition and related expenses under section 222 of the Internal Revenue
Code, to the extent deducted from gross income;
   (13) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2010, and after December 31, 2010, the
amount deducted for certain expenses of elementary and secondary school teachers under section

63(c)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code;
    (15) the additional standard deduction for qualified motor vehicle sales taxes allowable under

estate which is residential and used for homestead purposes is class 1a. In the case of a duplex or
triplex in which one of the units is used for homestead purposes, the entire property is deemed to
be used for homestead purposes. The market value of class 1a property must be determined based
upon the value of the house, garage, and land.
   The first $500,000 of market value of class 1a property has a net class rate of one percent of its
market value; and the market value of class 1a property that exceeds $500,000 has a class rate of
1.25 percent of its market value.

income-providing source certifies, upon the request of the homestead occupant, that the homestead
occupant satisfies the disability requirements of this paragraph, and that the property is not eligible
for the valuation exclusion under subdivision 34.
    Property is classified and assessed under paragraph (b) only if the commissioner of revenue or
the county assessor certifies that the homestead occupant satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.

of .45 percent of its market value. The remaining market value of class 1b property has a class rate
using the rates for class 1a or class 2a property, whichever is appropriate, of similar market value.
    (c) Class 1c property is commercial use real and personal property that abuts public water as
defined in section 103G.005, subdivision 15, and is devoted to temporary and seasonal residential
occupancy for recreational purposes but not devoted to commercial purposes for more than 250 days
in the year preceding the year of assessment, and that includes a portion used as a homestead by the
owner, which includes a dwelling occupied as a homestead by a shareholder of a corporation that
owns the resort, a partner in a partnership that owns the resort, or a member of a limited liability
company that owns the resort even if the title to the homestead is held by the corporation, partnership,
or limited liability company. For purposes of this paragraph, property is devoted to a commercial
purpose on a specific day if any portion of the property, excluding the portion used exclusively as a
homestead, is used for residential occupancy and a fee is charged for residential occupancy. Class 1c
property must contain three or more rental units. A "rental unit" is defined as a cabin, condominium,
townhouse, sleeping room, or individual camping site equipped with water and electrical hookups
for recreational vehicles. Class 1c property must provide recreational activities such as the rental
of ice fishing houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski equipment;
provide marina services, launch services, or guide services; or sell bait and fishing tackle. Any unit

in which the right to use the property is transferred to an individual or entity by deeded interest,
or the sale of shares or stock, no longer qualifies for class 1c even though it may remain available
for rent. A camping pad offered for rent by a property that otherwise qualifies for class 1c is also
class 1c, regardless of the term of the rental agreement, as long as the use of the camping pad does
not exceed 250 days. ­         I­

         t­; for purposes of this sentence, properties are deemed to be owned by the same owner if each
of them is owned by a limited liability company, and both limited liability companies have the same
membership. The portion of the property used as a homestead is class 1a property under paragraph
(a). The remainder of the property is classified as follows: the first $600,000 of market value is tier
I, the next $1,700,000 of market value is tier II, and any remaining market value is tier III. The class
rates for class 1c are: tier I, 0.50 percent; tier II, 1.0 percent; and tier III, 1.25 percent. Owners of
real and personal property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation
purposes in which all or a portion of the property was devoted to commercial purposes for not more
than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment desiring classification as class 1c, must
submit a declaration to the assessor designating the cabins or units occupied for 250 days or less
in the year preceding the year of assessment by January 15 of the assessment year. Those cabins or
units and a proportionate share of the land on which they are located must be designated as class 1c
as otherwise provided. The remainder of the cabins or units and a proportionate share of the land on
which they are located must be designated as class 3a commercial. The owner of property desiring
designation as class 1c property must provide guest registers or other records demonstrating that
the units for which class 1c designation is sought were not occupied for more than 250 days in the
year preceding the assessment if so requested. The portion of a property operated as a (1) restaurant,
(2) bar, (3) gift shop, (4) conference center or meeting room, and (5) other nonresidential facility
operated on a commercial basis not directly related to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy
for recreation purposes does not qualify for class 1c.
      (d) Class 1d property includes structures that meet all of the following criteria:
   (1) the structure is located on property that is classified as agricultural property under section
273.13, subdivision 23;
   (2) the structure is occupied exclusively by seasonal farm workers during the time when they
work on that farm, and the occupants are not charged rent for the privilege of occupying the property,
provided that use of the structure for storage of farm equipment and produce does not disqualify the
property from classification under this paragraph;
      (3) the structure meets all applicable health and safety requirements for the appropriate season;
and
   (4) the structure is not salable as residential property because it does not comply with local
ordinances relating to location in relation to streets or roads.
      The market value of class 1d property has the same class rates as class 1a property under

2011, chapter 8, section 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 19a. Additions to federal taxable income. For individuals, estates, and trusts, there shall
be added to federal taxable income:
   (1)(i) interest income on obligations of any state other than Minnesota or a political or
governmental subdivision, municipality, or governmental agency or instrumentality of any state
other than Minnesota exempt from federal income taxes under the Internal Revenue Code or any
other federal statute; and
   (ii) exempt-interest dividends as defined in section 852(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code,
except:
    (A) the portion of the exempt-interest dividends exempt from state taxation under the laws of
the United States; and
    (B) the portion of the exempt-interest dividends derived from interest income on obligations of
the state of Minnesota or its political or governmental subdivisions, municipalities, governmental
agencies or instrumentalities, but only if the portion of the exempt-interest dividends from such
Minnesota sources paid to all shareholders represents 95 percent or more of the exempt-interest
dividends, including any dividends exempt under subitem (A), that are paid by the regulated
investment company as defined in section 851(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the fund of the
regulated investment company as defined in section 851(g) of the Internal Revenue Code, making
the payment; and

and use, motor vehicle sales, or excise taxes paid to any other state or to any province or territory of
Canada, to the extent allowed as a deduction under section 63(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, but
the addition may not be more than the amount by which the itemized deductions as allowed under
section 63(d) of the Internal Revenue Code exceeds the amount of the standard deduction as defined
in section 63(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, disregarding the amounts allowed under sections
63(c)(1)(C) and 63(c)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code. For the purpose of this paragraph, the
disallowance of itemized deductions under section 68 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, income,
sales and use, motor vehicle sales, or excise taxes are the last itemized deductions disallowed;

expenses or interest used in computing net interest income for the subtraction allowed under
subdivision 19b, clause (1);

partner because the partnership elected to pay the tax on the income under section 6242(a)(2) of the
Internal Revenue Code;
    (7) 80 percent of the depreciation deduction allowed under section 168(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code. For purposes of this clause, if the taxpayer has an activity that in the taxable year
generates a deduction for depreciation under section 168(k) and the activity generates a loss for the
taxable year that the taxpayer is not allowed to claim for the taxable year, "the depreciation allowed
under section 168(k)" for the taxable year is limited to excess of the depreciation claimed by the
activity under section 168(k) over the amount of the loss from the activity that is not allowed in
the taxable year. In succeeding taxable years when the losses not allowed in the taxable year are
allowed, the depreciation under section 168(k) is allowed;

Revenue Code exceeds the deduction allowable by section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended through December 31, 2003;

allowable under section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code;

   (d) For a development consisting of housing, the authority to spend tax increments under this

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.1763, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Expenditures outside district. (a) For each tax increment financing district, an amount
equal to at least 75 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments paid by properties in the
district must be expended on activities in the district or to pay bonds, to the extent that the proceeds
of the bonds were used to finance activities in the district or to pay, or secure payment of, debt service
on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment districts for which the request for
certification was made after June 30, 1995, the in-district percentage for purposes of the preceding
sentence is 80 percent. Not more than 25 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments
paid by properties in the district may be expended, through a development fund or otherwise, on
activities outside of the district but within the defined geographic area of the project except to pay,
or secure payment of, debt service on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment
districts for which the request for certification was made after June 30, 1995, the pooling percentage
for purposes of the preceding sentence is 20 percent. The revenue derived from tax increments for
the district that are expended on costs under section 469.176, subdivision 4h, paragraph (b), may
be deducted first before calculating the percentages that must be expended within and without the
district.
    (b) In the case of a housing district, a housing project, as defined in section 469.174, subdivision
11, is an activity in the district.
   (c) All administrative expenses are for activities outside of the district, except that if the only

expenses for activities outside of the district under this subdivision are for the purposes described
in paragraph (d), administrative expenses will be considered as expenditures for activities in the
district.
    (d) The authority may elect, in the tax increment financing plan for the district, to increase by
up to ten percentage points the permitted amount of expenditures for activities located outside the
geographic area of the district under paragraph (a). As permitted by section 469.176, subdivision
4k, the expenditures, including the permitted expenditures under paragraph (a), need not be made
within the geographic area of the project. Expenditures that meet the requirements of this paragraph
are legally permitted expenditures of the district, notwithstanding section 469.176, subdivisions 4b,
4c, and 4j. To qualify for the increase under this paragraph, the expenditures must:
    (1) be used exclusively to assist housing that meets the requirement for a qualified low-income
building, as that term is used in section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code; and
    (2) not exceed the qualified basis of the housing, as defined under section 42(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code, less the amount of any credit allowed under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code;
and
   (3) be used to:
   (i) acquire and prepare the site of the housing;
   (ii) acquire, construct, or rehabilitate the housing; or
   (iii) make public improvements directly related to the housing.
                                                                 ­; or
   (4) be used to develop housing:
   (i) if the market value of the housing does not exceed the lesser of:
   (A) 150 percent of the average market value of single-family homes in that municipality; or
    (B) $200,000 for municipalities located in the metropolitan area, as defined in section 473.121,
or $125,000 for all other municipalities; and
    (ii) if the expenditures are used to pay the cost of site acquisition, relocation, demolition of
existing structures, site preparation, and pollution abatement on one or more parcels, if the parcel
contains a residence containing one to four family dwelling units that has been vacant for six or
more months and is in foreclosure as defined in section 325N.10, subdivision 7, but without regard
to whether the residence is the owner's principal residence, and only after the redemption period
stated in the notice provided under section 580.06 has expired.
    (e) For a district created within a biotechnology and health sciences industry zone as defined in
section 469.330, subdivision 6, or for an existing district located within such a zone, tax increment
derived from such a district may be expended outside of the district but within the zone only
for expenditures required for the construction of public infrastructure necessary to support the
activities of the zone, land acquisition, and other redevelopment costs as defined in section 469.176,
subdivision 4j. These expenditures are considered as expenditures for activities within the district.
  (f) The authority under paragraph (d), clause (4), expires on December 31, 2016. Increments
may continue to be expended under this authority after that date, if they are used to pay bonds or

binding contracts that would qualify under subdivision 3, paragraph (a), if December 31, 2016, is
considered to be the last date of the five-year period after certification under that provision.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for any district that is subject to the provisions
of section 469.1763, regardless of when the request for certification of the district was made.
   Sec. 12. Laws 2010, chapter 389, article 7, section 22, is amended to read:
    Sec. 22. CITY OF RAMSEY; TAX INCREMENT FINANCING DISTRICT; SPECIAL
RULES.
    (a) If the city of Ramsey or an authority of the city elects upon the adoption of a tax increment
financing plan for a district, the rules under this section apply to a redevelopment tax increment
financing district established by the city or an authority of the city. The redevelopment tax increment
district includes parcels within the area bounded on the east by Ramsey Boulevard, on the north by
Bunker Lake Boulevard as extended west to Llama Street, on the west by Llama Street, and on the
south by a line running parallel to and 600 feet south of the southerly right-of-way for U.S. Highway
10, but including Parcels 28-32-25-43-0007 and 28-32-25-34-0002 in their entirety, and excluding
the Anoka County Regional Park property in its entirety. A parcel within this area that is included
in a tax increment financing district that was certified before the date of enactment of this act may
be included in the district created under this act if the initial district is decertified.
    (b) The requirements for qualifying a redevelopment tax increment district under Minnesota
Statutes, section 469.174, subdivision 10, do not apply to the parcels located within the district.

be undertaken within a five-year period from the date of certification of a tax increment financing
district, is considered to be met for the district if the activities were undertaken within ten years from
the date of certification of the district.
    (e) Except for administrative expenses, the in-district percentage for purposes of the restriction
on pooling under Minnesota Statutes, section 469.1763, subdivision 2, for this district is 100 percent.

Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 1280 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
   That the House recede from its amendment and that S.F. No. 1280 be further amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:

employee or deposited in or about a place of business for personal services rendered by an

any or all of the gratuity to a fund or pool operated for the benefit of the employer or employees.

shared gratuities to employees participating in the agreement;

   (3) post a copy of this section for the information of employees.
    The commissioner may require the employer to pay restitution in the amount of the gratuities
diverted. If the records maintained by the employer do not provide sufficient information to
determine the exact amount of gratuities diverted, the commissioner may make a determination of
gratuities diverted based on available evidence and mediate a settlement with the employer."
   We request the adoption of this report and repassage of the bill.

Minnesota, that procures insurance on any property, interests, or risks of any nature other than life
insurance directly from a nonadmitted insurer, must agree to file with the commissioner of revenue
all returns required under chapter 297I and pay to the commissioner of revenue any amounts
required to be paid under chapter 297I. Upon that agreement, the commissioner of commerce shall
issue a license, good for one year. Insurance procured under the license is valid and the provisions
of the policies are considered to be in accordance, and construed as if identical in effect, with the
standard policy prescribed by the laws of this state. The insurers may enter the state to perform any
act necessary or proper in the conduct of the business.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for nonadmitted insurance policies that go into
effect after July 20, 2011.
     Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 60A.196, is amended to read:
     60A.196 DEFINITIONS.

   Subd. 3. Unavailability of other coverage; presumption. There shall be a rebuttable
presumption that the following coverages are unavailable from a licensed insurer:
    (a) coverages where one portion of the risk is acceptable to licensed insurers but another portion
of the same risk is not acceptable. The entire coverage may be placed with eligible surplus lines
insurers if it can be shown that the eligible surplus lines insurer will accept the entire coverage but
not the rejected portion alone; and

insurers.
    Subd. 5. Streamlined application for exempt commercial purchasers. A surplus lines broker
is not required to make a diligent search to determine whether the full amount or type of insurance
can be obtained from licensed insurers when the broker is seeking to procure or place nonadmitted
insurance for an exempt commercial purchaser provided:
   (1) the broker procuring or placing the nonadmitted insurance has disclosed to the exempt
commercial purchaser that the insurance may or may not be available from a licensed insurer that
may provide greater protection with more regulatory oversight; and
   (2) the exempt commercial purchaser has subsequently requested in writing for the broker to
procure or place the insurance from a nonadmitted insurer.

subdivisions 3a, 4, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e, 5, 6, and 7 and section 62E.18.
    Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 62E.14, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 4f. Waiver of preexisting conditions; persons covered by a community-based health
care coverage program. A person may enroll in the comprehensive plan, with a waiver of
preexisting condition limitation in subdivision 3, if the following requirements are met:
    (1) the person was formerly enrolled in a community-based health care coverage program under
section 62Q.80;
    (2) the person is a Minnesota resident; and
    (3) the person submits an application for coverage that is received by the writing carrier no
later than 90 days after coverage under the community-based health care program is terminated.
For purposes of this clause, termination of coverage includes exceeding the maximum lifetime or
annual benefit on existing coverage, or moving out of an area served by the program.

defined in section 62J.03, subdivision 8, or the provider's designee as agreed to by that designee,
shall, at the request of a consumer, and at no cost to the consumer or the consumer's employer,

to accept from the consumer's health plan company for the services specified by the consumer,
specifying the amount of the allowable payment due from the health plan company. Health

plan companies must allow contracted providers, or their designee, to release this information.
If a consumer has no applicable public or private coverage, the health care provider must give
the consumer, and at no cost to the consumer, a good faith estimate of the average allowable
reimbursement the provider accepts as payment from private third-party payers for the services
specified by the consumer and the estimated amount the noncovered consumer will be required to
pay. Payment information provided by a provider, or by the provider's designee as agreed to by that
designee, to a patient pursuant to this subdivision does not constitute a legally binding estimate of
the allowable charge for or cost to the consumer of services.
    (b) A health plan company, as defined in section 62J.03, subdivision 10, shall, at the request of
an enrollee intending to receive specific health care services or the enrollee's designee, provide that
enrollee with a good faith estimate of the allowable amount the health plan company has contracted
for with a specified provider within the network as total payment for a health care service specified
by the enrollee and the portion of the allowable amount due from the enrollee and the enrollee's
out-of-pocket costs. An estimate provided to an enrollee under this paragraph is not a legally binding
estimate of the allowable amount or enrollee's out-of-pocket cost.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively from January 1, 2011.
    Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 62L.03, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Minimum participation and contribution. (a) A small employer that has at least 75
percent of its eligible employees who have not waived coverage participating in a health benefit
plan and that contributes at least 50 percent toward the cost of coverage of each eligible employee
must be guaranteed coverage on a guaranteed issue basis from any health carrier participating in
the small employer market. The participation level of eligible employees must be determined at the
initial offering of coverage and at the renewal date of coverage. A health carrier must not increase
the participation requirements applicable to a small employer at any time after the small employer
has been accepted for coverage. For the purposes of this subdivision, waiver of coverage includes
only waivers due to: (1) coverage under another group health plan; (2) coverage under Medicare

    (b) If a small employer does not satisfy the contribution or participation requirements under
this subdivision, a health carrier may voluntarily issue or renew individual health plans, or a health
benefit plan which must fully comply with this chapter. A health carrier that provides a health benefit
plan to a small employer that does not meet the contribution or participation requirements of this
subdivision must maintain this information in its files for audit by the commissioner. A health carrier
may not offer an individual health plan, purchased through an arrangement between the employer
and the health carrier, to any employee unless the health carrier also offers the individual health
plan, on a guaranteed issue basis, to all other employees of the same employer. An arrangement
permitted under section 62L.12, subdivision 2, paragraph (k), is not an arrangement between the
employer and the health carrier for purposes of this paragraph.
    (c) Nothing in this section obligates a health carrier to issue coverage to a small employer that
currently offers coverage through a health benefit plan from another health carrier, unless the new
coverage will replace the existing coverage and not serve as one of two or more health benefit plans
offered by the employer. This paragraph does not apply if the small employer will meet the required
participation level with respect to the new coverage.

   (c) Proof of mailing of the notice of lapse under paragraph (a) or (b) for failure to pay the
premium before the expiration of the grace period is sufficient proof that notice required in this
subdivision has been given.
    (d) This subdivision does not apply to a life or health insurance policy or contract upon which
premiums are paid at a monthly interval or less and that contains any grace period required by statute
for the payment of premiums during which time the insurance continues in force.
     Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 72B.041, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Exceptions. (a) An individual who applies for an adjuster license in this state who is or
was licensed in another state for the same lines of authority based on an adjuster examination is not
required to complete a prelicensing examination. This exemption is only available if the person is
currently licensed in another state or if that state license has expired and the application is received
by this state within 90 days of expiration. The applicant must provide certification from the other
state that the applicant's license is currently in good standing or was in good standing at the time of
expiration or certification from the other state that its producer database records, maintained by the
NAIC, its affiliates, or its subsidiaries, indicate that the applicant or the applicant's company is or
was licensed in good standing. The certification must be of a license with the same line of authority
for which the individual has applied.
    (b) A person licensed as an adjuster in another state based on an adjuster examination who
establishes legal residency in this state must make application within 90 days to become a resident
adjuster licensee pursuant to this section, with the exception that no prelicensing examination is
required of this person.

     d­) A person applying for a license as a crop hail adjuster shall not be required to comply with
the requirements of subdivision 4.
    (d) A person applying for the crop line of authority who has satisfactorily completed the
National Crop Insurance Services Crop Adjuster Proficiency Program or the loss adjustment
training curriculum and competency testing required by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation
Standard Reinsurance Agreement is exempt from the requirements of subdivision 4.
   Sec. 40. [72B.055] MULTIPLE PERIL CROP INSURANCE ADJUSTMENTS.
    A licensed crop hail adjuster who has satisfactorily completed the loss adjustment training
curriculum and competency testing required by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC)
Standard Reinsurance Agreement may act as an adjuster in this state in regard to Multiple Peril
Crop Insurance policies regulated by the FCIC.
   Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 79A.06, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Private employers who have ceased to be self-insured. (a) Private employers who
have ceased to be private self-insurers shall discharge their continuing obligations to secure the
payment of compensation which is accrued during the period of self-insurance, for purposes of Laws
1988, chapter 674, sections 1 to 21, by compliance with all of the following obligations of current
certificate holders:
   (1) Filing reports with the commissioner to carry out the requirements of this chapter;
    (2) Depositing and maintaining a security deposit for accrued liability for the payment of any
compensation which may become due, pursuant to chapter 176. However, if a private employer
who has ceased to be a private self-insurer purchases an insurance policy from an insurer authorized
to transact workers' compensation insurance in this state which provides coverage of all claims
for compensation arising out of injuries occurring during the entire period the employer was
self-insured, whether or not reported during that period, the policy will:
    (i) discharge the obligation of the employer to maintain a security deposit for the payment of the
claims covered under the policy;
    (ii) discharge any obligation which the self-insurers' security fund has or may have for payment
of all claims for compensation arising out of injuries occurring during the period the employer was
self-insured, whether or not reported during that period; and
    (iii) discharge the obligations of the employer to pay any future assessments to the self-insurers'
security fund; provided, however, that a member that terminates its self-insurance authority on or
after August 1, 2010, shall be liable for an assessment under paragraph (b). The actuarial opinion
shall not take into consideration any transfer of the member's liabilities to an insurance policy if the
member obtains a replacement policy as described in this subdivision within one year of the date of
terminating its self-insurance.
    A private employer who has ceased to be a private self-insurer may instead buy an insurance
policy described above, except that it covers only a portion of the period of time during which
the private employer was self-insured; purchase of such a policy discharges any obligation that the
self-insurers' security fund has or may have for payment of all claims for compensation arising out of
injuries occurring during the period for which the policy provides coverage, whether or not reported
64TH DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 23, 2011                                          3319

during that period.
   A policy described in this clause may not be issued by an insurer unless it has previously been
approved as to the insurer, form, and substance by the commissioner; and
    (3) Paying within 30 days all assessments of which notice is sent by the security fund, for a
period of seven years from the last day its certificate of self-insurance was in effect. Thereafter, the
private employer who has ceased to be a private self-insurer may either: (i) continue to pay within
30 days all assessments of which notice is sent by the security fund until it has no incurred liabilities
for the payment of compensation arising out of injuries during the period of self-insurance; or (ii)
pay the security fund a cash payment equal to four percent of the net present value of all remaining
incurred liabilities for the payment of compensation under sections 176.101 and 176.111 as certified
by a member of the casualty actuarial society. Assessments shall be based on the benefits paid by the
employer during the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the employer's
right to self-insure is terminated or withdrawn.
    (b) With respect to a self-insurer who terminates its self-insurance authority after April 1, 1998,
that member shall obtain and file with the commissioner an actuarial opinion of its outstanding
liabilities as determined by an associate or fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society within 120
days of the date of its termination. If the actuarial opinion is not timely filed, the self-insurers'
security fund may, at its discretion, engage the services of an actuary for this purpose. The expense
of this actuarial opinion must be assessed against and be the obligation of the self-insurer. The
commissioner may issue a certificate of default against the self-insurer for failure to pay this
assessment to the self-insurers' security fund as provided by section 79A.04, subdivision 9. The
opinion may discount liabilities up to four percent per annum to net present value. Within 60 days
after notification of approval of the actuarial opinion by the commissioner, the exiting member
shall pay to the security fund an amount determined as follows: a percentage will be determined
by dividing the security fund's members' deficit as determined by the most recent audited financial
statement of the security fund by the total actuarial liability of all members of the security fund
as calculated by the commissioner within 30 days of the exit date of the member. This quotient
will then be multiplied by that exiting member's total future liability as contained in the exiting
member's actuarial opinion. If the payment is not made within 30 days of the notification, interest
on it at the rate prescribed by section 549.09 must be paid by the former member to the security
fund until the principal amount is paid in full.
    (c) A former member who terminated its self-insurance authority before April 1, 1998, who
has paid assessments to the self-insurers' security fund for seven years, and whose annualized
assessment is $15,000 or less, may buy out of its outstanding liabilities to the self-insurers' security
fund by an amount calculated as follows: 1.35 multiplied by the indemnity case reserves at the time
of the calculation, multiplied by the then current self-insurers' security fund annualized assessment
rate.
    (d) A former member who terminated its self-insurance authority before April 1, 1998, and who
is paying assessments within the first seven years after ceasing to be self-insured under paragraph
(a), clause (3), may elect to buy out its outstanding liabilities to the self-insurers' security fund
by obtaining and filing with the commissioner an actuarial opinion of its outstanding liabilities as
determined by an associate or fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society. The opinion must separate
liability for indemnity benefits from liability for medical benefits, and must discount each up to four
percent per annum to net present value. Within 30 days after notification of approval of the actuarial

opinion by the commissioner, the member shall pay to the security fund an amount equal to 120
percent of that discounted outstanding indemnity liability, multiplied by the greater of the average
annualized assessment rate since inception of the security fund or the annual rate at the time of the
most recent assessment.
    (e) A former member who has paid the security fund according to paragraphs (b) to (d) and
subsequently receives authority from the commissioner to again self-insure shall be assessed under
section 79A.12, subdivision 2, only on indemnity benefits paid on injuries that occurred after the
former member received authority to self-insure again; provided that the member furnishes verified
data regarding those benefits to the security fund.
    (f) In addition to proceedings to establish liabilities and penalties otherwise provided, a failure
to comply may be the subject of a proceeding before the commissioner. An appeal from the
commissioner's determination may be taken pursuant to the contested case procedures of chapter
14 within 30 days of the commissioner's written determination.
    Any current or past member of the self-insurers' security fund is subject to service of process
on any claim arising out of chapter 176 or this chapter in the manner provided by section 5.25, or
as otherwise provided by law. The issuance of a certificate to self-insure to the private self-insured
employer shall be deemed to be the agreement that any process which is served in accordance with
this section shall be of the same legal force and effect as if served personally within this state.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 79A.24, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Purchase of insurance policy from an authorized insurer. A commercial
self-insurance group may purchase an insurance policy from an insurer authorized to transact
workers' compensation insurance in this state which provides coverage of all claims for
compensation arising out of injuries occurring during the entire period or during a portion of the
period of time in which the commercial self-insurance group has been in existence. While the
insurance policy remains in effect, it discharges the obligation of the commercial self-insurance
group to maintain a security deposit for the claims covered under the policy. A policy described in
this subdivision may not be issued by an insurer unless it has previously been approved as to the
insurer, form, and substance by the commissioner.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 79A.24, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. Insolvency of a commercial self-insurance group insurer. In the event of the
insolvency of the insurer that issued a policy under subdivision 5 to a commercial self-insurance
group, eligibility for chapter 60C coverage under the policy is determined by applying the
requirements of section 60C.09, subdivision 2, clause (3), to each commercial self-insurance group
member separately, rather than to the net worth of the commercial self-insurance group entity or
aggregate net worth of all members of the commercial self-insurance group.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

January 15 each year. The council shall present its recommendations to the senate and house of
representatives committees with jurisdiction over the environment and natural resources budget by
February 15 in odd-numbered years, and within the first four weeks of the legislative session in
even-numbered years. The council's budget recommendations to the legislature shall be separate
from the Department of Natural Resource's budget recommendations.
    (b) To encourage and support local conservation efforts, the council shall establish a conservation
partners program. Local, regional, state, or national organizations may apply for matching grants for
restoration, protection, and enhancement of wetlands, prairies, forests, and habitat for fish, game, and
wildlife, prevention of forest fragmentation, encouragement of forest consolidation, and expansion
of restored native prairie.
   (c) The council may work with the Clean Water Council to identify projects that are consistent
with both the purpose of the outdoor heritage fund and the purpose of the clean water fund.
   (d) The council may make recommendations to the Legislative-Citizen Commission on
Minnesota Resources on scientific research that will assist in restoring, protecting, and enhancing
wetlands, prairies, forests, and habitat for fish, game, and wildlife, preventing forest fragmentation,
encouraging forest consolidation, and expanding restored native prairie.
    (e) Recommendations of the council, including approval of recommendations for the outdoor
heritage fund, require an affirmative vote of at least nine members of the council.
   (f) The council may work with the Clean Water Council, the Legislative-Citizen Commission on
Minnesota Resources, the Board of Water and Soil Resources, soil and water conservation districts,
and experts from Minnesota State Colleges and Universities and the University of Minnesota in
developing the council's recommendations.
    (g) The council shall develop and implement a process that ensures that citizens and potential
recipients of funds are included throughout the process, including the development and finalization
of the council's recommendations. The process must include a fair, equitable, and thorough process
for reviewing requests for funding and a clear and easily understood process for ranking projects.
    (h) The council shall use the regions of the state based upon the ecological ­

    (i) The council shall develop and submit to the Legislative Coordinating Commission plans for
the first ten years of funding, and a framework for 25 years of funding, consistent with statutory and
constitutional requirements. The council may use existing plans from other legislative, state, and
federal sources, as applicable.

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 3.303, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Constitutionally dedicated funding accountability. (a) The Legislative
Coordinating Commission shall develop and maintain a user-friendly, public-oriented Web site
that informs, educates, and demonstrates to the public how the constitutionally dedicated funds in
the arts and cultural heritage fund, outdoor heritage fund, clean water fund, parks and trails fund,
and environment and natural resources trust fund are being expended to meet the requirements
established for each fund in the state constitution. Information provided on the Web site must
include, but is not limited to:

   (iii) the amount and source of funding, including the fiscal year of the appropriation;
   (iv) the amount and source of any additional funding or leverage;
   (v) the duration of the project;
    (vi) the number of full-time equivalents funded under the project. For the purposes of this item,

members or members of an equivalent governing body ultimately responsible for awarding the
grants, as well as any grantmaking advisory group. In addition, an entity that awards competitive
grants, including but not limited to a state agency or any statewide, regional, or local organization,
must report whether an employee, decision maker, advisory group member, or other person involved
in the grant process disclosed a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest. If the entity reports
that a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest was disclosed, the entity must provide
the Legislative Coordinating Commission with a contact person for additional information and the
Legislative Coordinating Commission must post this information on the Web site. An entity that
awards competitive grants must obtain and apply the conflict of interest policies developed by the

and applies its own documented conflict of interest policies which are substantially similar to the
commissioner of administration's policies;

   (4) education about the areas and issues the projects address, including, when feasible, maps of
where projects have been undertaken;
    (5) all frameworks developed for future uses of each fund; and
   (6) methods by which members of the public may apply for project funds under any of the
constitutionally dedicated funds.
     (b) As soon as practicable or by January 15 of the applicable fiscal year, whichever comes
first, a state agency or other recipient of a direct appropriation from a fund covered under this
section shall submit the information required under paragraph (a) and, when applicable, compile
and submit the same information for any grant recipient or other subrecipient of funding. All
information for proposed and funded projects, including the proposed measurable outcomes, must
be made available on the Web site as soon as practicable. Information on the measured outcomes
and evaluation must be posted as soon as it becomes available. The costs of these activities shall be
paid out of the arts and cultural heritage fund, outdoor heritage fund, clean water fund, parks and
trails fund, and the environment and natural resources trust fund proportionately. For purposes of
this section, "measurable outcomes" means outcomes, indicators, or other performance measures
that may be quantified or otherwise measured in order to measure the effectiveness of a project or
program in meeting its intended goal or purpose.
    (c) The Legislative Coordinating Commission shall be responsible for receiving all ten-year
plans and 25-year frameworks for each of the constitutionally dedicated funds. To the extent
practicable, staff for the commission shall provide assistance and oversight to these planning
efforts and shall coordinate public access to hearings and public meetings for all planning efforts.

    Subd. 3. Compensation. The crop owner is entitled to the target price or the market price,
whichever is greater, of the damaged or destroyed crop plus adjustments for yield loss determined
according to agricultural stabilization and conservation service programs for individual farms,
adjusted annually, as determined by the commissioner, upon recommendation of the county
extension agent for the owner's county. Verification of fence damage or destruction by elk may be
provided by submitting photographs or other evidence and documentation together with a statement
from an independent witness using forms prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner,
upon recommendation of the agent, shall determine whether the crop damage or destruction or
damage to or destruction of a fence surrounding a crop or pasture is caused by elk and, if so, the
amount of the crop or fence that is damaged or destroyed. In any fiscal year, ­
                                                                              a­­

not be compensated for a damaged or destroyed crop or fence surrounding a crop or pasture that is
less than $100 in value and may be compensated up to $20,000, as determined under this section,
if normal harvest procedures for the area are followed. In any fiscal year, the commissioner may
provide compensation for claims filed under this section up to the amount expressly appropriated
for this purpose.
    Subd. 4. Insurance deduction. Payments authorized by this section must be reduced by amounts
received by the owner as proceeds from an insurance policy covering crop losses or damage to or
destruction of a fence surrounding a crop or pasture, or from any other source for the same purpose
including, but not limited to, a federal program.
    Subd. 5. Decision on claims; opening land to hunting. If the commissioner finds that the crop
or pasture owner has shown that the damage or destruction of the owner's crop or damage to or
destruction of a fence surrounding a crop or pasture was caused more probably than not by elk, the
commissioner shall pay compensation as provided in this section and the rules of the commissioner.

    (b) An aquatic farm propagating any species on the VHS susceptible list and having an
effluent discharge from the aquatic farm into public waters must test for VHS virus using the
guidelines of the Fish Health Blue Book or the Diagnostic Manual for Aquatic Animal Diseases.
The commissioner may, by written order published in the State Register, prescribe alternative
testing time periods and methods from those prescribed in the Fish Health Blue Book or the
OIE Diagnostic Manual if the commissioner determines that biosecurity measures will not be
compromised. These alternatives are not subject to the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14 and
section 14.386 does not apply. The commissioner must provide reasonable notice to affected parties
of any changes in testing requirements.
    (c) Results of fish health inspections must be provided to the commissioner for all fish that remain
in the state. All data used to prepare and issue a fish health certificate must be maintained for three

inspection before being transported from a containment facility, unless the fish are being transported
directly to an outlet for processing or other food purposes or unless the commissioner determines
that an inspection is not needed. A fish health inspection conducted for this purpose need only be
done on the lot or lots of fish that will be transported. The commissioner must conduct a fish health
inspection requested for this purpose within five working days of receiving written notice. Salmonids
and catfish may be immediately transported from a containment facility to another containment
facility once a sample has been obtained for a health inspection or once the five-day notice period
has expired.

   Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 97B.055, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. Hunting from vehicle by disabled hunters. (a) The commissioner may issue a special
permit, without a fee, to discharge a firearm or bow and arrow from a stationary motor vehicle to a
person who obtains the required licenses and who has a permanent physical disability that is more
substantial than discomfort from walking. The permit recipient must be:
   (1) unable to step from a vehicle without aid of a wheelchair, crutches, braces, or other
mechanical support or prosthetic device; or
   (2) unable to walk any distance because of a permanent lung, heart, or other internal disease that
requires the person to use supplemental oxygen to assist breathing.
    (b) The permanent physical disability must be established by medical evidence verified
in writing by a licensed physician ­   o­
                                        r, chiropractor, or certified nurse practitioner or certified
physician assistant acting under the direction of a licensed physician. The commissioner may
request additional information from the physician or chiropractor if needed to verify the applicant's
eligibility for the permit. Notwithstanding section 97A.418, the commissioner may, in consultation
with appropriate advocacy groups, establish reasonable minimum standards for permits to be
issued under this section. In addition to providing the medical evidence of a permanent disability,
the applicant must possess a valid disability parking certificate authorized by section 169.345 or
license plates issued under section 168.021.
    (c) A person issued a special permit under this subdivision and hunting deer may take a deer
of either sex, except in those antlerless permit areas and seasons where no antlerless permits are
offered. This subdivision does not authorize another member of a party to take an antlerless deer
under section 97B.301, subdivision 3.
   (d) A permit issued under this subdivision is valid for five years.
    (e) The commissioner may deny, modify, suspend, or revoke a permit issued under this section
for cause, including a violation of the game and fish laws or rules.
   (f) A person who knowingly makes a false application or assists another in making a false
application for a permit under this section is guilty of a misdemeanor. A physician, certified
nurse practitioner, certified physician assistant, or chiropractor who fraudulently certifies to the
commissioner that a person is permanently disabled as described in this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor.
    (g) Notwithstanding paragraph (d), the commissioner may issue a permit valid for the entire life
of the applicant if the commissioner determines that there is no chance that an applicant will become
ineligible for a permit under this section and the applicant requests a lifetime permit.
   Sec. 45. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 97B.075, is amended to read:
   97B.075 HUNTING RESTRICTED BETWEEN EVENING AND MORNING.
    (a) A person may not take protected wild animals, except raccoon and fox, with a firearm
between the evening and morning times established by commissioner's rule, except as provided in
this section.
   (b) Big game may be taken from one-half hour before sunrise until one-half hour after sunset.

    Sec. 46. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 97B.106, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Qualifications for crossbow permits. (a) The commissioner may issue a special
permit, without a fee, to take big game, small game, or rough fish with a crossbow to a person
that is unable to hunt or take rough fish by archery because of a permanent or temporary physical
disability. A crossbow permit issued under this section also allows the permittee to use a bow with a
mechanical device that draws, releases, or holds the bow at full draw as provided in section 97B.035,
subdivision 1, paragraph (a).
    (b) To qualify for a crossbow permit under this section, a temporary disability must render the
person unable to hunt or fish by archery for a minimum of two years after application for the permit
is made. The permanent or temporary disability must be established by medical evidence, and the
inability to hunt or fish by archery for the required period of time must be verified in writing by
(1) a licensed physician or a certified nurse practitioner or certified physician assistant acting under
the direction of a licensed physician; or (2) a licensed chiropractor. A person who has received a
special permit under this section because of a permanent disability is eligible for subsequent special
permits without providing medical evidence and verification of the disability.
    (c) The person must obtain the appropriate license.
    Sec. 47. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 97B.211, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

chained or cabled to a tree so that it cannot be moved from the site by a bear and the drum may not
include a mechanical device for dispensing feed. The drum must be marked as provided in section
97B.425. For purposes of this section, "drum" means a 30 gallon or larger drum.

    Subd. 4. Taking elk causing damage or nuisance. The commissioner may authorize licensed
hunters to take elk that are causing damage or nuisance from August 15 to March 1 under rules
prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner may issue licenses to hunters impartially
selected from a list of elk hunt applicants who indicated on their application that they would be
interested and available to respond to an elk damage or nuisance situation. Notwithstanding section
97A.433, subdivision 2, clause (2), a person receiving a license to hunt elk under this subdivision
does not lose eligibility for future elk hunts.

   Sec. 54. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 97B.667, is amended to read:
  97B.667 REMOVAL OF BEAVERS, BEAVER DAMS, AND LODGES BY ROAD
AUTHORITIES.
    When a drainage watercourse is impaired by a beaver dam and the water damages or threatens to
damage a public road, the road authority, as defined in section 160.02, subdivision 25, may remove
the impairment and any associated beaver lodge within 300 feet of the road. Notwithstanding any
law to the contrary, the road authority may kill or arrange to have killed by any lawful means a
beaver associated with the lodge. Before killing or arranging to kill a beaver under this section,
the road authority must contact a conservation officer for a special beaver permit. The conservation
officer must issue the permit for any beaver subject to this section. A road authority that kills or
arranges to have killed a beaver under this section must notify a conservation officer or the officer's
designee as specified in the permit within ten days after the animal is killed. A road authority may,
after consultation with the Wildlife Division and the Board of Water and Soil Resources, implement
a local beaver control program designed to reduce the number of incidents of beaver interfering with
or damaging a public road. The local control program may include the offering of a bounty for the
lawful taking of beaver.

   97C.205 TRANSPORTING AND STOCKING FISH.
   (a) Except on the water body where taken, a person may not transport a live fish in a quantity of
water sufficient to keep the fish alive, unless the fish:
   (1) is being transported under an aquaculture license as authorized under sections 17.4985 and
17.4986;
   (2) is being transported for a fishing contest weigh-in under section 97C.081;
   (3) is a minnow being transported under section 97C.505 or 97C.515;
   (4) is being transported by a commercial fishing license holder under section 97C.821; or
    (5) is being transported as otherwise authorized in this section or as prescribed for certifiable
diseases under sections 17.46 to 17.4999.
   (b) The commissioner may adopt rules to allow and regulate:
   (1) the transportation of fish and fish eggs; and
   (2) the stocking of waters with fish or fish eggs.
   (c) The commissioner must allow the possession of fish on special management or experimental
waters to be prepared as a meal on the ice or on the shore of that water body if the fish:
   (1) were lawfully taken;
   (2) have been packaged by a licensed fish packer; and
   (3) do not otherwise exceed the statewide possession limits.
    (d) The commissioner shall prescribe rules designed to encourage local sporting organizations
to propagate game fish by using rearing ponds. The rules must:
   (1) prescribe methods to acquire brood stock for the ponds by seining public waters;

    (2) allow the sporting organizations to own and use seines and other necessary equipment; and
   (3) prescribe methods for stocking the fish in public waters that give priority to the needs of the
community where the fish are reared and the desires of the organization operating the rearing pond.
    (e) A person age 16 or under may, for purposes of display in a home aquarium, transport
largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, rock bass, black crappie, white crappie, bluegill
pumpkinseed, green sunfish, orange spotted sunfish, and black, yellow, and brown bullheads taken
by angling, except as otherwise ordered by the commissioner upon documentation of an emergency
fish disease in Minnesota waters, as defined in section 17.4982, subdivision 9. No more than four
of each species may be transported at any one time, and any individual fish can be no longer than
ten inches in total length. The commissioner may, by written order published in the State Register,
prohibit transportation of live fish under this paragraph to help prevent spread of an emergency
fish disease documented to occur in Minnesota waters. The order is exempt from the rulemaking
provisions of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does not apply.

    Sec. 63. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 97C.341, is amended to read:
    97C.341 CERTAIN AQUATIC LIFE PROHIBITED FOR BAIT.
    (a) A person may not use live minnows imported from outside of the state, game fish, goldfish,
or carp for bait. The commissioner may, by written order published in the State Register, authorize
use of game fish eggs as bait and prescribe restrictions on their use. The order is exempt from the
rulemaking provisions of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does not apply.
    (b) A person may not import or possess live, frozen, or processed bait from known waters where
viral hemorrhagic septicemia has been identified as being present, except as provided in paragraph
(c). For purposes of this paragraph, "bait" includes fish, aquatic worms, amphibians, invertebrates,
and insects used for ­

    (c) Cisco and rainbow smelt taken under rules adopted by the commissioner may be used as:
    (1) fresh or frozen bait only on Lake Superior; or
    (2) bait that has been processed to inactivate viral hemorrhagic septicemia in a manner prescribed
by rules adopted by the commissioner.
    (d) To ensure that frozen or dead fish being brought into the state are not in violation of paragraph
(b), the following paperwork must accompany the shipment. Documents must be open for inspection
by the commissioner at any reasonable time. All documents must be available to purchasers of these
bait items. Each container or package of frozen or dead fish must have the following information:
    (1) water body source;
    (2) lot number;

   (3) company contact including name, phone, and address;
   (4) date of packaging and labeling; and
   (5) valid negative fish health certification from the source water body.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 64. [97C.342] CERTIFICATION THAT FROZEN OR DEAD FISH BAIT ARE
DISEASE FREE.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings
given:
    (1) "Water body" means waters identified by a unique Department of Natural Resources public
water identification number; a body of water that has defined boundaries and that has no Department
of Natural Resources public water identification number; or a section of stream designated by a
Kittle number, lock and dam numbering system, or to the upstream and downstream barrier.
    (2) "Commercial license" means a license issued under section 97A.475, subdivision 26, 27, 29,
or 30.
     Subd. 2. Bait restrictions. Frozen or dead fish on the official list of viral hemorrhagic septicemia
susceptible species published by the United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Services; cisco (all Coregonus, including lake herring and tullibee); and smelt
(all Osmerus, Spirincus, Hypomesus, and Allosmerus) being used as bait in waters of the state must
originate from water bodies certified disease free. Certification for these water bodies is valid for
one year from the date of test results.
   Subd. 3. Testing requests. As a part of commercial licensing procedures, a list of water
bodies requiring a fish health certification for commercial bait harvest must be provided to the
commissioner no later than March 1 of each year, except in 2011 the list must be provided by
August 1.
    Subd. 4. Certification fees. Notwithstanding section 16A.1283, the commissioner may by
written order published in the State Register, establish fees for the services and testing required to
issue health certifications for a water body. The fees must be set in an amount that does not recover
significantly more or less than the costs of providing services to health-certify a water body. The
fees are not subject to the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14 and sections 14.125 and 14.386 do
not apply. The services covered under this subdivision include:
   (1) cost of collecting the species for testing;
   (2) fish health inspection and certification, including initial tissue sample collection, basic fish
health assessment, and fish disease testing; and
   (3) administrative overhead for tracking and documentation of testing.
    Subd. 5. Transportation permit requirements. A commercial licensee harvesting from a
certified disease-free water body must obtain a live fish importation, transportation, and stocking
permit to move fish from that source. A live fish importation, transportation, and stocking permit
may be used for multiple shipments within a 30-day term period if the source and destination
3426                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [64TH DAY

remain the same. The commercial licensee must contact the department within 24 hours of
exercising the permit. Permits may be issued through the department's regional offices or St. Paul
office and must be obtained prior to moving fish as approved for movement from these certified
disease-free water bodies.
    Subd. 6. Reporting requirements. A commercial licensee harvesting bait under this section
must maintain records on forms provided by the commissioner for each lot of frozen or dead fish
for sale as bait. The records must include the lot number for each batch of frozen or dead fish, water
body health certification documentation, transportation permit number, and other information as
specified on the reporting form. The commercial licensee must enter required records onto forms
within 24 hours of packaging and labeling each lot of fish. The commercial licensee must retain
records for three years following the year of creation. All records required to be retained must be
open to inspection by the commissioner at any reasonable time.
    Subd. 7. Labeling requirements. Frozen or dead fish from certified disease-free water bodies
that are being sold as bait must be labeled. The seller of the product is responsible for making sure
the items are labeled according to this section. Each container or package of frozen or dead fish bait
must have the following information:
   (1) Department of Natural Resources certified water body number;
   (2) Department of Natural Resources transportation permit number;
   (3) lot number;
   (4) date of harvest from water body;
   (5) date of packaging and labeling;
   (6) bait store or vendor name where purchased; and
   (7) disease-free certification date.
    Subd. 8. Persons using frozen or dead fish bait. A person on, or taking wild animals in, waters
of the state with frozen or dead fish bait must possess all labeling as prescribed under subdivision
7. The person must retain the labeling until the bait is used and no longer in the person's possession.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 65. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103B.101, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
   Subd. 9. Powers and duties. In addition to the powers and duties prescribed elsewhere, the
board shall:

Gains and losses arising from the sale of securities shall be apportioned as follows:
    (a) If the sale of securities results in a net gain during a fiscal year, the gain shall be apportioned
in equal installments over the next ten fiscal years to offset net losses in those years. If any portion
of an installment is not needed to recover subsequent losses identified in paragraph (b) it shall be
added to the principal of the fund.
     (b) If the sale of securities results in a net loss during a fiscal year, the net loss shall be recovered
first from the gains in paragraph (a) apportioned to that fiscal year. If these gains are insufficient,
any remaining net loss shall be recovered from interest and dividend income in equal installments
over the following ten fiscal years.

levied, and state the maximum number of years that the levy authorization will apply.

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 126C.15, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Building allocation. (a) A district or cooperative must allocate its compensatory
revenue to each school building in the district or cooperative where the children who have
generated the revenue are served unless the school district or cooperative has received permission
under Laws 2005, First Special Session chapter 5, article 1, section 50, to allocate compensatory
revenue according to student performance measures developed by the school board.
     (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a district or cooperative may allocate up to five percent of the
amount of compensatory revenue that the district receives to school sites according to a plan adopted
by the school board. The money reallocated under this paragraph must be spent for the purposes
listed in subdivision 1, but may be spent on students in any grade, including students attending
school readiness or other prekindergarten programs.
   (c) For the purposes of this section and section 126C.05, subdivision 3, "building" means
education site as defined in section 123B.04, subdivision 1.
    (d) Notwithstanding section 123A.26, subdivision 1, compensatory revenue generated by
students served at a cooperative unit shall be paid to the cooperative unit.
    (e) A district or cooperative with school building openings, school building closings, changes in
attendance area boundaries, or other changes in programs or student demographics between the prior
year and the current year may reallocate compensatory revenue among sites to reflect these changes.
A district or cooperative must report to the department any adjustments it makes according to this
paragraph and the department must use the adjusted compensatory revenue allocations in preparing
the report required under section 123B.76, subdivision 3, paragraph (c).
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 126C.41, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Retired employee health benefits. (a) A district may levy an amount up to the

1992, to pay for health insurance or unreimbursed medical expenses for licensed and nonlicensed
employees who have terminated services in the employing district and withdrawn from active
teaching service or other active service, as applicable, before July 1, 1992, and to pay for health
insurance or unreimbursed medical expenses for licensed and nonlicensed employees who have
terminated services in the employing district and withdrawn from active teaching service or other
active service, as applicable before July 1, 1998, only if a sunset clause is in effect for the current
collective bargaining agreement. The total amount of the levy each year may not exceed $600,000.
   (b) In addition to the levy authority granted under paragraph (a), a school district may levy

for other postemployment benefits expenses actually paid during the previous fiscal year. For
purposes of this subdivision, "postemployment benefits" means benefits giving rise to a liability
under Statement No. 45 of the Government Accounting Standards Board. A district seeking levy
authority under this subdivision must:
    (1) create or have created an actuarial liability to pay postemployment benefits to employees or
officers after their termination of service;
   (2) have a sunset clause in effect for the current collective bargaining agreement as required by
paragraph (a); and
   (3) apply for the authority in the form and manner required by the commissioner of education.
If the total levy authority requested under this paragraph exceeds the amount established in
paragraph (c), the commissioner must proportionately reduce each district's maximum levy
authority under this subdivision. The commissioner may subsequently adjust each district's levy
authority under this subdivision so long as the total levy authority does not exceed the maximum
levy authority for that year.
   (c) The maximum levy authority under paragraph (b) must not exceed the following amounts:
   (1) $9,242,000 for taxes payable in 2010;
   (2) $29,863,000 for taxes payable in 2011; and
    (3) for taxes payable in 2012 and later, the maximum levy authority must not exceed the sum of
the previous year's authority and $14,000,000.

consistent with this subdivision. The commissioner must revise and align the state's academic
standards and graduation requirements, consistent with the review cycle established in this
subdivision and the requirements of chapter 14, but must not proceed to finally adopt revised and
realigned academic standards and graduation requirements in rule without first receiving specific

   (2) students scheduled to graduate in the 2014-2015 school year or later must satisfactorily
complete an algebra II credit or its equivalent.
The commissioner also must ensure that the statewide mathematics assessments administered to
students in grades 3 through 8 and 11 are aligned with the state academic standards in mathematics,
consistent with section 120B.30, subdivision 1, paragraph (b). The commissioner must implement
a review of the academic standards and related benchmarks in mathematics beginning in the
2015-2016 school year.
    (c) The commissioner in the 2007-2008 school year must revise and align the state's academic

    Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 120B.30, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Statewide testing. (a) The commissioner, with advice from experts with
appropriate technical qualifications and experience and stakeholders, consistent with subdivision
1a, shall include in the comprehensive assessment system, for each grade level to be tested,
state-constructed tests developed from and aligned with the state's required academic standards
under section 120B.021, include multiple choice questions, and be administered annually to all
students in grades 3 through 8. State-developed high school tests aligned with the state's required
academic standards under section 120B.021 and administered to all high school students in a
subject other than writing must include multiple choice questions. The commissioner shall establish
one or more months during which schools shall administer the tests to students each school year.
For students enrolled in grade 8 before the 2005-2006 school year, Minnesota basic skills tests
in reading, mathematics, and writing shall fulfill students' basic skills testing requirements for
a passing state notation. The passing scores of basic skills tests in reading and mathematics are
the equivalent of 75 percent correct for students entering grade 9 based on the first uniform test
administered in February 1998. Students who have not successfully passed a Minnesota basic skills
test by the end of the 2011-2012 school year must pass the graduation-required assessments for
diploma under paragraph (c).
    (b) The state assessment system must be aligned to the most recent revision of academic
standards as described in section 120B.023 in the following manner:
    (1) mathematics;
    (i) grades 3 through 8 beginning in the 2010-2011 school year; and
    (ii) high school level beginning in the 2013-2014 school year;

      (2) science; grades 5 and 8 and at the high school level beginning in the 2011-2012 school year;
and
   (3) language arts and reading; grades 3 through 8 and high school level beginning in the
2012-2013 school year.
    (c) For students enrolled in grade 8 in the 2005-2006 school year and later, only the following
options shall fulfill students' state graduation test requirements:
      (1) for reading and mathematics:
    (i) obtaining an achievement level equivalent to or greater than proficient as determined through
a standard setting process on the Minnesota comprehensive assessments in grade 10 for reading
and grade 11 for mathematics or achieving a passing score as determined through a standard setting
process on the graduation-required assessment for diploma in grade 10 for reading and grade 11 for
mathematics or subsequent retests;
    (ii) achieving a passing score as determined through a standard setting process on the
state-identified language proficiency test in reading and the mathematics test for English language
learners or the graduation-required assessment for diploma equivalent of those assessments for
students designated as English language learners;
    (iii) achieving an individual passing score on the graduation-required assessment for diploma
as determined by appropriate state guidelines for students with an individual education plan or 504
plan;
    (iv) obtaining achievement level equivalent to or greater than proficient as determined through
a standard setting process on the state-identified alternate assessment or assessments in grade 10 for
reading and grade 11 for mathematics for students with an individual education plan; or
    (v) achieving an individual passing score on the state-identified alternate assessment or
assessments as determined by appropriate state guidelines for students with an individual education
plan; and
      (2) for writing:
      (i) achieving a passing score on the graduation-required assessment for diploma;
    (ii) achieving a passing score as determined through a standard setting process on the
state-identified language proficiency test in writing for students designated as English language
learners;
    (iii) achieving an individual passing score on the graduation-required assessment for diploma
as determined by appropriate state guidelines for students with an individual education plan or 504
plan; or
    (iv) achieving an individual passing score on the state-identified alternate assessment or
assessments as determined by appropriate state guidelines for students with an individual education
plan.
   (d) Students enrolled in grade 8 in any school year from the 2005-2006 school year to the
2009-2010 school year who do not pass the mathematics graduation-required assessment for

    In addition, the school board granting the students their diplomas may formally decide to
include a notation of high achievement on the high school diplomas of those graduating seniors
who, according to established school board criteria, demonstrate exemplary academic achievement
during high school.
    (e) The 3rd through 8th grade and high school test results shall be available to districts for
diagnostic purposes affecting student learning and district instruction and curriculum, and for
establishing educational accountability. The commissioner must disseminate to the public the high
school test results upon receiving those results.
    (f) The 3rd through 8th grade and high school tests must be aligned with state academic
standards. The commissioner shall determine the testing process and the order of administration.
The statewide results shall be aggregated at the site and district level, consistent with subdivision
1a.
   (g) In addition to the testing and reporting requirements under this section, the commissioner
shall include the following components in the statewide public reporting system:
    (1) uniform statewide testing of all students in grades 3 through 8 and at the high school level
that provides appropriate, technically sound accommodations or alternate assessments;
   (2) educational indicators that can be aggregated and compared across school districts and across
time on a statewide basis, including average daily attendance, high school graduation rates, and high
school drop-out rates by age and grade level;
     (3) state results on the American College Test; and
    (4) state results from participation in the National Assessment of Educational Progress so that
the state can benchmark its performance against the nation and other states, and, where possible,
against other countries, and contribute to the national effort to monitor achievement.

Code of Federal Regulations, title 34, section 99.3. The commissioner shall also report data that
compares performance results among school sites, school districts, Minnesota and other states, and
Minnesota and other nations. The commissioner shall disseminate to schools and school districts
a more comprehensive report containing testing information that meets local needs for evaluating
instruction and curriculum. The commissioner shall disseminate to charter school authorizers a
more comprehensive report containing testing information that contains anonymized data where
cell count data are sufficient to protect student identity and that meets the authorizer's needs in
fulfilling its obligations under section 124D.10.
     Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 120B.30, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Access to tests. Consistent with section 13.34, the commissioner must adopt and
publish a policy to provide public and parental access for review of basic skills tests, Minnesota
Comprehensive Assessments, or any other such statewide test and assessment which would not
compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process. Upon receiving a
written request, the commissioner must make available to parents or guardians a copy of their
student's actual responses to the test questions for their review.

implications of changes in districts' demographic profiles over time. Any report the commissioner
disseminates containing summary data on student performance must integrate student performance
and the demographic factors that strongly correlate with that performance.
     Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 120B.36, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. School performance report cards. (a) The commissioner shall report student
academic performance under section 120B.35, subdivision 2; the percentages of students showing
low, medium, and high growth under section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph (b); school
safety and student engagement and connection under section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph
(d); rigorous coursework under section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph (c); two separate
student-to-teacher ratios that clearly indicate the definition of teacher consistent with sections
122A.06 and 122A.15 for purposes of determining these ratios; staff characteristics excluding
salaries; student enrollment demographics; district mobility; and extracurricular activities.
The report also must indicate a school's adequate yearly progress status, and must not set any
designations applicable to high- and low-performing schools due solely to adequate yearly progress
status.
   (b) The commissioner shall develop, annually update, and post on the department Web site
school performance report cards.

   (c) The commissioner must make available performance report cards by the beginning of each
school year.
   (d) A school or district may appeal its adequate yearly progress status in writing to the
commissioner within 30 days of receiving the notice of its status. The commissioner's decision to
uphold or deny an appeal is final.
    (e) School performance report card data are nonpublic data under section 13.02, subdivision 9,

    Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.40, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 8a. Probationary period for principals hired internally. A probationary period of
two school years is required for a licensed teacher employed by the board who is subsequently
employed by the board as a licensed school principal or assistant principal and an additional
probationary period of two years is required for a licensed assistant principal employed by the
board who is subsequently employed by the board as a licensed principal. A licensed teacher
subsequently employed by the board as a licensed school principal or assistant principal retains the
teacher's continuing contract status as a licensed teacher during the probationary period under this
subdivision and has the right to return to the teacher's previous position or an equivalent position,
if available, if the teacher is not promoted.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective June 30, 2011, and applies to all contracts for
internally hired licensed school principals and assistant principals ratified or modified after that date.
    Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.40, subdivision 11, is amended to read:
    Subd. 11. Unrequested leave of absence. (a) The board may place on unrequested leave
of absence, without pay or fringe benefits, as many teachers as may be necessary because of
discontinuance of position, lack of pupils, financial limitations, or merger of classes caused by
consolidation of districts. The unrequested leave is effective at the close of the school year. In
placing teachers on unrequested leave, the board may exempt from the effects of paragraphs (b) to
(g) those teachers who teach in a Montessori or a language immersion program, provide instruction
in an advanced placement course, or hold a kindergarten through grade 12 instrumental vocal
classroom music license and currently serve as a choir, band or orchestra director and who, in
the superintendent's judgment, meet a unique need in delivering curriculum. However, within the
Montessori or language immersion program, a teacher must be placed on unrequested leave of

   (b) The board may exempt from the effects of paragraph (a) those teachers who teach in a
Montessori or a language immersion program or provide instruction in an advanced placement
course and who, in the superintendent's judgment, meet a unique need in delivering curriculum.
However, within the Montessori or language immersion program, a teacher shall be discontinued

of seniority results in the termination of services, on account of discontinuance of position or lack
of pupils, of another teacher who also holds a provisional license in the same field. The provisions
of this clause do not apply to vocational education licenses.

reinstatement.
   Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 123B.143, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Contract; duties. All districts maintaining a classified secondary school must
employ a superintendent who shall be an ex officio nonvoting member of the school board. The
authority for selection and employment of a superintendent must be vested in the board in all cases.
An individual employed by a board as a superintendent shall have an initial employment contract
for a period of time no longer than three years from the date of employment. Any subsequent
employment contract must not exceed a period of three years. A board, at its discretion, may or may
not renew an employment contract. A board must not, by action or inaction, extend the duration
of an existing employment contract. Beginning 365 days prior to the expiration date of an existing
employment contract, a board may negotiate and enter into a subsequent employment contract to
take effect upon the expiration of the existing contract. A subsequent contract must be contingent
upon the employee completing the terms of an existing contract. If a contract between a board and a
superintendent is terminated prior to the date specified in the contract, the board may not enter into
another superintendent contract with that same individual that has a term that extends beyond the
date specified in the terminated contract. A board may terminate a superintendent during the term
of an employment contract for any of the grounds specified in section 122A.40, subdivision 9 or
13. A superintendent shall not rely upon an employment contract with a board to assert any other
continuing contract rights in the position of superintendent under section 122A.40. Notwithstanding
the provisions of sections 122A.40, subdivision 10 or 11, 123A.32, 123A.75, or any other law to
the contrary, no individual shall have a right to employment as a superintendent based on order of
employment in any district. If two or more districts enter into an agreement for the purchase or
sharing of the services of a superintendent, the contracting districts have the absolute right to select
one of the individuals employed to serve as superintendent in one of the contracting districts and
no individual has a right to employment as the superintendent to provide all or part of the services
based on order of employment in a contracting district. The superintendent of a district shall perform
the following:
   (1) visit and supervise the schools in the district, report and make recommendations about their

condition when advisable or on request by the board;
   (2) recommend to the board employment and dismissal of teachers;
    (3) annually evaluate each school principal assigned responsibility for supervising a school
building within the district, consistent with section 123B.147, subdivision 3, paragraph (b);

the building or buildings to which the principal is assigned.
    (b) To enhance a principal's leadership skills and support and improve teaching practices, school
performance, and student achievement, a district must develop and implement a performance-based
system for annually evaluating school principals assigned to supervise a school building within
the district. The evaluation must be designed to improve teaching and learning by supporting
the principal in shaping the school's professional environment and developing teacher quality,
performance, and effectiveness. The annual evaluation must:
   (1) support and improve a principal's instructional leadership, organizational management,
and professional development, and strengthen the principal's capacity in the areas of instruction,
supervision, evaluation, and teacher development;
   (2) include formative and summative evaluations;
    (3) be consistent with a principal's job description, a district's long-term plans and goals, and
the principal's own professional multiyear growth plans and goals, all of which must support
the principal's leadership behaviors and practices, rigorous curriculum, school performance, and
high-quality instruction;
   (4) include on-the-job observations and previous evaluations;
    (5) allow surveys to help identify a principal's effectiveness, leadership skills and processes, and
strengths and weaknesses in exercising leadership in pursuit of school success;
   (6) use longitudinal data on student academic growth as an evaluation component and
incorporate district achievement goals and targets; and
    (7) be linked to professional development that emphasizes improved teaching and learning,
curriculum and instruction, student learning, and a collaborative professional culture.
   The provisions of this paragraph are intended to provide districts with sufficient flexibility to

agreement under section 124D.09, subdivision 10, is eligible to receive aid for the costs of
providing postsecondary courses at the high school. Beginning in fiscal year 2011, districts only are

to close. However, a school board may endorse or authorize the establishing of a charter school to
replace the school the board decided to close. Applicants seeking a charter under this circumstance
must demonstrate to the authorizer that the charter sought is substantially different in purpose and
program from the school the board closed and that the proposed charter satisfies the requirements of
this subdivision. If the school board that closed the school authorizes the charter, it must document
in its affidavit to the commissioner that the charter is substantially different in program and purpose
from the school it closed.
   An authorizer shall not approve an application submitted by a charter school developer
under subdivision 4, paragraph (a), if the application does not comply with this subdivision. The
commissioner shall not approve an affidavit submitted by an authorizer under subdivision 4,
paragraph (b), if the affidavit does not comply with this subdivision.

    Subd. 2. Applicability. This section applies only to charter schools formed and operated under
this section.
    Subd. 3. Authorizer. (a) For purposes of this section, the terms defined in this subdivision have

submits to an authorizer for approval to establish a charter school that documents the school
developer's mission statement, school purposes, program design, financial plan, governance and
management structure, and background and experience, plus any other information the authorizer
requests. The application also shall include a "statement of assurances" of legal compliance
prescribed by the commissioner.
    "Affidavit" means a written statement the authorizer submits to the commissioner for approval
to establish a charter school under subdivision 4 attesting to its review and approval process before
chartering a school.

                            e single-purpose authorizers that are charitable, nonsectarian organizations
formed under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and incorporated in the
state of Minnesota whose sole purpose is to charter schools. Eligible organizations interested in
being approved as an authorizer under this paragraph must submit a proposal to the commissioner
that includes the provisions of paragraph (c) and a five-year financial plan. Such authorizers shall
consider and approve applications using the criteria provided in subdivision 4 and shall not limit
the applications it solicits, considers, or approves to any single curriculum, learning program, or
method.
     (c) An eligible authorizer under this subdivision must apply to the commissioner for approval as
an authorizer before submitting any affidavit to the commissioner to charter a school. The application
for approval as a charter school authorizer must demonstrate the applicant's ability to implement
the procedures and satisfy the criteria for chartering a school under this section. The commissioner
must approve or disapprove an application within ­    60
                                                       ­ 45 business days of the application deadline.
If the commissioner disapproves the application, the commissioner must notify the applicant of the
specific deficiencies in writing and the applicant then has 20 business days to address the deficiencies
to the commissioner's satisfaction. After the 20 business days expire, the commissioner has 15
business days to make a final decision to approve or disapprove the application. Failing to address
the deficiencies to the commissioner's satisfaction makes an applicant ineligible to be an authorizer.
The commissioner, in establishing criteria for approval, must consider the applicant's:
    (1) capacity and infrastructure;
    (2) application criteria and process;
    (3) contracting process;
    (4) ongoing oversight and evaluation processes; and
    (5) renewal criteria and processes.

its intent to withdraw as an authorizer on June 30 in the next calendar year. The commissioner

authorizer submits an affidavit to the commissioner.

must notify the authorizer in writing of any findings that may subject the authorizer to corrective
action and the authorizer then has 15 business days to request an informal hearing before the
commissioner takes corrective action. If the commissioner terminates a contract between an
authorizer and a charter school under this paragraph, the commissioner may assist the charter
school in acquiring a new authorizer.

terminating an authorizer's ability to charter a school for:
   (1) failing to demonstrate the criteria under paragraph (c) under which the commissioner
approved the authorizer;
    (2) violating a term of the chartering contract between the authorizer and the charter school board
of directors; ­o­

or nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and the provisions under the applicable chapter shall
apply to the school except as provided in this section.
    Notwithstanding sections 465.717 and 465.719, a school district, subject to this section and
section 124D.11, may create a corporation for the purpose of establishing a charter school.
    (b) Before the operators may establish and operate a school, the authorizer must file an affidavit
with the commissioner stating its intent to charter a school. An authorizer must file a separate
affidavit for each school it intends to charter. The affidavit must state the terms and conditions
under which the authorizer would charter a school and how the authorizer intends to oversee the
fiscal and student performance of the charter school and to comply with the terms of the written
contract between the authorizer and the charter school board of directors under subdivision 6.
The commissioner must approve or disapprove the authorizer's affidavit within 60 business days
of receipt of the affidavit. If the commissioner disapproves the affidavit, the commissioner shall
notify the authorizer of the deficiencies in the affidavit and the authorizer then has 20 business days
to address the deficiencies. If the authorizer does not address deficiencies to the commissioner's
satisfaction, the commissioner's disapproval is final. Failure to obtain commissioner approval
precludes an authorizer from chartering the school that is the subject of this affidavit.
    (c) The authorizer may prevent an approved charter school from opening for operation if, among
other grounds, the charter school violates this section or does not meet the ready-to-open standards
that are part of the authorizer's oversight and evaluation process or are stipulated in the charter
school contract.

   Any change in board governance must conform with the board structure established under this
paragraph.
   (h) The granting or renewal of a charter by an authorizer must not be conditioned upon the
bargaining unit status of the employees of the school.
    (i) The granting or renewal of a charter school by an authorizer must not be contingent on
the charter school being required to contract, lease, or purchase services from the authorizer.
Any potential contract, lease, or purchase of service from an authorizer must be disclosed to the
commissioner, accepted through an open bidding process, and be a separate contract from the
charter contract. The school must document the open bidding process. An authorizer must not enter
into a contract to provide management and financial services for a school that it authorizes, unless
the school documents that it received at least two competitive bids.
    (j) An authorizer may permit the board of directors of a charter school to expand the operation
of the charter school to additional sites or to add additional grades at the school beyond those
described in the authorizer's original affidavit as approved by the commissioner only after submitting

    Subd. 4a. Conflict of interest. (a) An individual is prohibited from serving as a member of the
charter school board of directors if the individual, an immediate family member, or the individual's
partner is an owner, employee or agent of, or a contractor with a for-profit or nonprofit entity or
individual with whom the charter school contracts, directly or indirectly, for professional services,
goods, or facilities. A violation of this prohibition renders a contract voidable at the option of the
commissioner or the charter school board of directors. A member of a charter school board of
directors who violates this prohibition is individually liable to the charter school for any damage
caused by the violation.
    (b) No member of the board of directors, employee, officer, or agent of a charter school shall
participate in selecting, awarding, or administering a contract if a conflict of interest exists. A conflict

of this prohibition renders the contract void.
     (c) Any employee, agent, or board member of the authorizer who participates in the initial review,
approval, ongoing oversight, evaluation, or the charter renewal or nonrenewal process or decision
is ineligible to serve on the board of directors of a school chartered by that authorizer.
   (d) An individual may serve as a member of the board of directors if no conflict of interest under
paragraph (a) exists.
    (e) The conflict of interest provisions under this subdivision do not apply to compensation paid
to a teacher employed by the charter school who also serves as a member of the board of directors.
    (f) The conflict of interest provisions under this subdivision do not apply to a teacher who
provides services to a charter school through a cooperative formed under chapter 308A when the
teacher also serves on the charter school board of directors.
    Subd. 5. Conversion of existing schools. A board of an independent or special school district
may convert one or more of its existing schools to charter schools under this section if 60 percent of
the full-time teachers at the school sign a petition seeking conversion. The conversion must occur
at the beginning of an academic year.

corporation that does not own the leased facility is ineligible to receive charter school lease aid. The
state is immune from liability resulting from a contract between a charter school and an affiliated
nonprofit building corporation.

    Subd. 19. Disseminate information. (a) The authorizer, the operators, and the department must
disseminate information to the public on how to form and operate a charter school. Charter schools
must disseminate information about how to use the offerings of a charter school. Targeted groups
include low-income families and communities, students of color, and students who are at risk of
academic failure.
   (b) Authorizers, operators, and the department also may disseminate information about the
successful best practices in teaching and learning demonstrated by charter schools.
    Subd. 20. Leave to teach in a charter school. If a teacher employed by a district makes a written
request for an extended leave of absence to teach at a charter school, the district must grant the leave.
The district must grant a leave not to exceed a total of five years. Any request to extend the leave shall
be granted only at the discretion of the school board. The district may require that the request for a
leave or extension of leave be made before February 1 in the school year preceding the school year
in which the teacher intends to leave, or February 1 of the calendar year in which the teacher's leave
is scheduled to terminate. Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision and except for section
122A.46, subdivision 7, the leave is governed by section 122A.46, including, but not limited to,
reinstatement, notice of intention to return, seniority, salary, and insurance.
   During a leave, the teacher may continue to aggregate benefits and credits in the Teachers'
Retirement Association account under chapters 354 and 354A, consistent with subdivision 22.
    Subd. 21. Collective bargaining. Employees of the board of directors of a charter school may,
if otherwise eligible, organize under chapter 179A and comply with its provisions. The board of
directors of a charter school is a public employer, for the purposes of chapter 179A, upon formation
of one or more bargaining units at the school. Bargaining units at the school must be separate from
any other units within an authorizing district, except that bargaining units may remain part of the
appropriate unit within an authorizing district, if the employees of the school, the board of directors
of the school, the exclusive representative of the appropriate unit in the authorizing district, and
the board of the authorizing district agree to include the employees in the appropriate unit of the
authorizing district.
   Subd. 22. Teacher and other employee retirement. (a) Teachers in a charter school must be
public school teachers for the purposes of chapters 354 and 354a.
  (b) Except for teachers under paragraph (a), employees in a charter school must be public
employees for the purposes of chapter 353.
   Subd. 23. Causes for nonrenewal or termination of charter school contract. (a) The duration

of the contract with an authorizer must be for the term contained in the contract according to
subdivision 6. The authorizer may or may not renew a contract at the end of the term for any ground
listed in paragraph (b). An authorizer may unilaterally terminate a contract during the term of the
contract for any ground listed in paragraph (b). At least 60 business days before not renewing or
terminating a contract, the authorizer shall notify the board of directors of the charter school of the
proposed action in writing. The notice shall state the grounds for the proposed action in reasonable
detail and that the charter school's board of directors may request in writing an informal hearing
before the authorizer within 15 business days of receiving notice of nonrenewal or termination
of the contract. Failure by the board of directors to make a written request for ­      a an informal
hearing within the 15-business-day period shall be treated as acquiescence to the proposed action.
Upon receiving a timely written request for a hearing, the authorizer shall give ten business days'
notice to the charter school's board of directors of the hearing date. The authorizer shall conduct
an informal hearing before taking final action. The authorizer shall take final action to renew or
not renew a contract no later than 20 business days before the proposed date for terminating the
contract or the end date of the contract.
     (b) A contract may be terminated or not renewed upon any of the following grounds:
     (1) failure to meet the requirements for pupil performance contained in the contract;
     (2) failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal management;
     (3) violations of law; or
     (4) other good cause shown.
   If a contract is terminated or not renewed under this paragraph, the school must be dissolved
according to the applicable provisions of chapter 3

4, clause (1).
     (b) For purposes of this section and section 124D.11:

and the commissioner before starting operations. The charter school board must submit changes in
its insurance carrier or policy to its authorizer and the commissioner within 20 business days of the
change.
    (d) Notwithstanding section 3.736, the charter school shall assume full liability for its activities
and indemnify and hold harmless the commissioner and the authorizer, and the officers, agents,
and employees of the department and authorizer from any suit, claim, or liability arising from any

    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) and section 127A.45, for a charter school ceasing operation
on or prior to June 30 of a school year, for the payment periods occurring after the school ceases
serving students, the commissioner shall withhold the estimated state aid owed the school. The
charter school board of directors and authorizer must submit to the commissioner a closure plan
under chapter 308A or 317A, and financial information about the school's liabilities and assets.
After receiving the closure plan, financial information, an audit of pupil counts, documentation
of lease expenditures, and monitoring of special education expenditures, the commissioner may
release cash withheld and may continue regular payments up to the current year payment percentages
if further amounts are owed. If, based on audits and monitoring, the school received state aid in
excess of the amount owed, the commissioner shall retain aid withheld sufficient to eliminate the
aid overpayment. For a charter school ceasing operations prior to, or at the end of, a school year,
notwithstanding section 127A.45, subdivision 3, preliminary final payments may be made after
receiving the closure plan, audit of pupil counts, monitoring of special education expenditures,
documentation of lease expenditures, and school submission of Uniform Financial Accounting and
Reporting Standards (UFARS) financial data for the final year of operation. Final payment may be
made upon receipt of audited financial statements under section 123B.77, subdivision 3.
    (c) If a charter school fails to comply with the commissioner's directive to return, for cause,
federal or state funds administered by the department, the commissioner may withhold an amount

Minnesota, a school district, intermediate school district, or service cooperative after receiving an
undisputed invoice for goods and services, the commissioner may withhold an amount of state aid

school district, intermediate school district, or service cooperative. An interested state agency,
school district, intermediate school district, or education cooperative shall notify the commissioner

received the original invoice.
    (e) Notwithstanding section 127A.45, subdivision 3, and paragraph (a), 80 percent of the start-up
cost aid under subdivision 8 shall be paid within 45 days after the first day of student attendance for
that school year.
    (f) In order to receive state aid payments under this subdivision, a charter school in its first
three years of operation must submit a school calendar in the form and manner requested by the
department and a quarterly report to the Department of Education. The report must list each student
by grade, show the student's start and end dates, if any, with the charter school, and for any student
participating in a learning year program, the report must list the hours and times of learning year
activities. The report must be submitted not more than two weeks after the end of the calendar
quarter to the department. The department must develop a Web-based reporting form for charter
schools to use when submitting enrollment reports. A charter school in its fourth and subsequent
year of operation must submit a school calendar and enrollment information to the department in
the form and manner requested by the department.
    (g) Notwithstanding sections 317A.701 to 317A.791, upon closure of a charter school and
satisfaction of creditors, cash and investment balances remaining shall be returned to the state.

on file at the Department of Education at least 15 days prior to the date of first payment of state aid
for the fiscal year.
   (i) State aid entitlements shall be computed for a charter school only for the portion of a school
year for which it has a valid, signed contract under section 124D.10, subdivision 6.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 124D.19, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Community education director. (a) Except as provided under paragraphs (b) and (c),
each board shall employ a licensed community education director. The board shall submit the name
of the person who is serving as director of community education under this section on the district's
annual community education report to the commissioner.
    (b) A board may apply to the Minnesota Board of School Administrators under Minnesota Rules,
part 3512.3500, subpart 9, for authority to use an individual who is not licensed as a community
education director.

program, and food support education and training program.
   (b) A district, group of districts, state agency, or private nonprofit organization providing an
adult basic education program may meet this requirement by developing a tracking system based
on either or both of the following methodologies:
    (1) conducting a reliable follow-up survey; or
    (2) submitting student information, including Social Security numbers for data matching.
    Data related to obtaining employment must be collected in the first quarter following program
completion or can be collected while the student is enrolled, if known. Data related to employment
retention must be collected in the third quarter following program exit. Data related to any other
specified outcome may be collected at any time during a program year.
    (c) When a student in a program is requested to provide the student's Social Security number,
the student must be notified in a written form easily understandable to the student that:
    (1) providing the Social Security number is optional and no adverse action may be taken against
the student if the student chooses not to provide the Social Security number;
    (2) the request is made under section 124D.52, subdivision 7;
    (3) if the student provides the Social Security number, it will be used to assess the effectiveness
of the program by tracking the student's subsequent career; and
     (4) the Social Security number will be shared with the Department of Education; Minnesota
State Colleges and Universities; Office of Higher Education; Department of Human Services; and

any other governmental entities.
    (d) Annually a district, group of districts, state agency, or private nonprofit organization
providing programs under this section must forward the tracking data collected to the Department
of Education. For the purposes of longitudinal studies on the employment status of former students
under this section, the Department of Education must forward the Social Security numbers to
the Department of Employment and Economic Development to electronically match the Social
Security numbers of former students with wage detail reports filed under section 268.044. The
results of data matches must, for purposes of this section and consistent with the requirements
of the United States Code, title 29, section 2871, of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, be
compiled in a longitudinal form by the Department of Employment and Economic Development
and released to the Department of Education in the form of summary data that does not identify the
individual students. The Department of Education may release this summary data. State funding
for adult basic education programs must not be based on the number or percentage of students who
decline to provide their Social Security numbers or on whether the program is evaluated by means
of a follow-up survey instead of data matching.

interested stakeholders, including principals, superintendents, teachers, school board members,
and parents, among other stakeholders, to develop a performance-based system model for annually
evaluating school principals. In developing the system model, the group must at least consider how
principals develop and maintain:
   (1) high standards for student performance;
   (2) rigorous curriculum;
   (3) quality instruction;
   (4) a culture of learning and professional behavior;
   (5) connections to external communities;

   (7) leadership behaviors that create effective schools and improve school performance, including
how to plan for, implement, support, advocate for, communicate about, and monitor continuous and
improved learning.
   The group also may consider whether to establish a multitiered evaluation system that supports
newly licensed principals in becoming highly skilled school leaders and provides opportunities for
advanced learning for more experienced school leaders.
    (b) The commissioner, the Minnesota Association of Secondary School Principals, and the
Minnesota Association of Elementary School Principals must submit a written report and all
the group's working papers to the education committees of the legislature by February 1, 2012,
discussing the group's responses to paragraph (a) and its recommendations for a performance-based
system model for annually evaluating school principals. The group convened under this section

   (iii) prone restraints may only be used by staff who have received specific training;
   (iv) each incident of the use of prone restraints is reported to the department within five working
days on a form provided by the department or on a district's restrictive procedure documentation
form; and
   (v) a district, prior to using prone restraints, must review any known medical or psychological
limitations that contraindicate the use of prone restraints.
The department will report back to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative
committees with primary jurisdiction over education policy by February 1, 2012, on the use of
prone restraints in the schools.

the district of residence is the district designated by the commissioner.
    (b) If a district other than the resident district places a pupil for care and treatment, the district
placing the pupil must notify and give the resident district an opportunity to participate in the
placement decision. When an immediate emergency placement of a pupil is necessary and time
constraints foreclose a resident district from participating in the emergency placement decision, the
district in which the pupil is temporarily placed must notify the resident district of the emergency
placement within 15 days. The resident district has up to five business days after receiving notice
of the emergency placement to request an opportunity to participate in the placement decision,
which the placing district must then provide.
    (c) When a child is temporarily placed for care and treatment in a day program located in another
district and the child continues to live within the district of residence during the care and treatment,
the district of residence is responsible for providing transportation to and from the care and treatment
program and an appropriate educational program for the child. The resident district may establish
reasonable restrictions on transportation, except if a Minnesota court or agency orders the child
placed at a day care and treatment program and the resident district receives a copy of the order,
then the resident district must provide transportation to and from the program unless the court or
agency orders otherwise. Transportation shall only be provided by the resident district during regular
operating hours of the resident district. The resident district may provide the educational program
at a school within the district of residence, at the child's residence, or in the district in which the day
treatment center is located by paying tuition to that district.
    (d) When a child is temporarily placed in a residential program for care and treatment, the
nonresident district in which the child is placed is responsible for providing an appropriate
educational program for the child and necessary transportation while the child is attending the
educational program; and must bill the district of the child's residence for the actual cost of
providing the program, as outlined in section 125A.11, except as provided in paragraph (e).
However, the board, lodging, and treatment costs incurred in behalf of a child with a disability
placed outside of the school district of residence by the commissioner of human services or the
commissioner of corrections or their agents, for reasons other than providing for the child's special
educational needs must not become the responsibility of either the district providing the instruction
or the district of the child's residence. For the purposes of this section, the state correctional
facilities operated on a fee-for-service basis are considered to be residential programs for care and
treatment.
    (e) A privately owned and operated residential facility may enter into a contract to obtain
appropriate educational programs for special education children and services with a joint powers
entity. The entity with which the private facility contracts for special education services shall be
the district responsible for providing students placed in that facility an appropriate educational
program in place of the district in which the facility is located. If a privately owned and operated
residential facility does not enter into a contract under this paragraph, then paragraph (d) applies.
    (f) The district of residence shall pay tuition and other program costs, not including
transportation costs, to the district providing the instruction and services. The district of residence
may claim general education aid for the child as provided by law. Transportation costs must be paid
by the district responsible for providing the transportation and the state must pay transportation

aid to that district.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 125A.51, is amended to read:
  125A.51 PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN WITHOUT DISABILITIES; EDUCATION
AND TRANSPORTATION.
    The responsibility for providing instruction and transportation for a pupil without a disability
who has a short-term or temporary physical or emotional illness or disability, as determined by the
standards of the commissioner, and who is temporarily placed for care and treatment for that illness
or disability, must be determined as provided in this section.
    (a) The school district of residence of the pupil is the district in which the pupil's parent or
guardian resides. If there is a dispute between school districts regarding residency, the district of
residence is the district designated by the commissioner.
    (b) When parental rights have been terminated by court order, the legal residence of a child
placed in a residential or foster facility for care and treatment is the district in which the child resides.
    (c) Before the placement of a pupil for care and treatment, the district of residence must be
notified and provided an opportunity to participate in the placement decision. When an immediate
emergency placement is necessary and time does not permit resident district participation in the
placement decision, the district in which the pupil is temporarily placed, if different from the district
of residence, must notify the district of residence of the emergency placement within 15 days of the
placement. When a nonresident district makes an emergency placement without first consulting with
the resident district, the resident district has up to five business days after receiving notice of the
emergency placement to request an opportunity to participate in the placement decision, which the
placing district must then provide.
    (d) When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed for care and treatment in a day
program and the pupil continues to live within the district of residence during the care and treatment,
the district of residence must provide instruction and necessary transportation to and from the care
and treatment program for the pupil. The resident district may establish reasonable restrictions on
transportation, except if a Minnesota court or agency orders the child placed at a day care and
treatment program and the resident district receives a copy of the order, then the resident district
must provide transportation to and from the program unless the court or agency orders otherwise.
Transportation shall only be provided by the resident district during regular operating hours of the
resident district. The resident district may provide the instruction at a school within the district of
residence, at the pupil's residence, or in the case of a placement outside of the resident district, in the
district in which the day treatment program is located by paying tuition to that district. The district
of placement may contract with a facility to provide instruction by teachers licensed by the state
Board of Teaching.
    (e) When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed in a residential program for care
and treatment, the district in which the pupil is placed must provide instruction for the pupil and
necessary transportation while the pupil is receiving instruction, and in the case of a placement
outside of the district of residence, the nonresident district must bill the district of residence for the
actual cost of providing the instruction for the regular school year and for summer school, excluding
transportation costs.

    (f) Notwithstanding paragraph (e), if the pupil is homeless and placed in a public or private
homeless shelter, then the district that enrolls the pupil under section 127A.47, subdivision 2, shall
provide the transportation, unless the district that enrolls the pupil and the district in which the pupil
is temporarily placed agree that the district in which the pupil is temporarily placed shall provide
transportation. When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed in a residential program
outside the district of residence, the administrator of the court placing the pupil must send timely
written notice of the placement to the district of residence. The district of placement may contract
with a residential facility to provide instruction by teachers licensed by the state Board of Teaching.
For purposes of this section, the state correctional facilities operated on a fee-for-service basis are
considered to be residential programs for care and treatment.
    (g) The district of residence must include the pupil in its residence count of pupil units and pay
tuition as provided in section 123A.488 to the district providing the instruction. Transportation costs
must be paid by the district providing the transportation and the state must pay transportation aid to
that district. For purposes of computing state transportation aid, pupils governed by this subdivision
must be included in the disabled transportation category if the pupils cannot be transported on a
regular school bus route without special accommodations.

   Subd. 3. Health and safety revenue. A district's health and safety revenue for a fiscal year
equals the district's alternative facilities levy under section 123B.59, subdivision 5, paragraph (b),
plus the greater of zero or:
    (1) the sum of (a) the total approved cost of the district's hazardous substance plan for fiscal
years 1985 through 1989, plus (b) the total approved cost of the district's health and safety program
for fiscal year 1990 through the fiscal year to which the levy is attributable, excluding expenditures
funded with bonds issued under section 123B.59 or 123B.62, or chapter 475; certificates of
indebtedness or capital notes under section 123B.61; levies under section 123B.58, 123B.59,

123B.63, or 126C.40, subdivision 1 or 6; and other federal, state, or local revenues, minus
    (2) the sum of (a) the district's total hazardous substance aid and levy for fiscal years 1985
through 1989 under sections 124.245 and 275.125, subdivision 11c, plus (b) the district's health and
safety revenue under this subdivision, for years before the fiscal year to which the levy is attributable.
    Subd. 4. Health and safety levy. To receive health and safety revenue, a district may levy an
amount equal to the district's health and safety revenue as defined in subdivision 3 multiplied by
the lesser of one, or the ratio of the quotient derived by dividing the adjusted net tax capacity of the
district for the year preceding the year the levy is certified by the adjusted marginal cost pupil units
in the district for the school year to which the levy is attributable, to $2,935.
    Subd. 5. Health and safety aid. A district's health and safety aid is the difference between its
health and safety revenue and its health and safety levy. If a district does not levy the entire amount
permitted, health and safety aid must be reduced in proportion to the actual amount levied. Health
and safety aid may not be reduced as a result of reducing a district's health and safety levy according
to section 123B.79.

subdivision 6, health and safety revenue must not be used:
   (1) to finance a lease purchase agreement, installment purchase agreement, or other deferred
payments agreement;
   (2) for the construction of new facilities, remodeling of existing facilities, or the purchase of
portable classrooms;
      (3) for interest or other financing expenses;
    (4) for energy efficiency projects under section 123B.65, for a building or property or part of a
building or property used for postsecondary instruction or administration or for a purpose unrelated
to elementary and secondary education;
    (5) for replacement of building materials or facilities including roof, walls, windows, internal
fixtures and flooring, nonhealth and safety costs associated with demolition of facilities, structural
repair or replacement of facilities due to unsafe conditions, violence prevention and facility security,
ergonomics, ­;
      (6) for public announcement systems and emergency communications devices; or
    (7) for building and heating, ventilating and air conditioning supplies, maintenance, and cleaning
activities. All assessments, investigations, inventories, and support equipment not leading to the
engineering or construction of a project shall be included in the health, safety, and environmental
management costs in subdivision 8, paragraph (a).
    Subd. 6b. Health and safety projects. (a) Health and safety revenue applications defined in
subdivision 1 must be accompanied by a description of each project for which funding is being
requested. Project descriptions must provide enough detail for an auditor to determine if the work
qualifies for revenue. For projects other than fire and life safety projects, playground projects,
and health, safety, and environmental management activities, a project description does not need
to include itemized details such as material types, room locations, square feet, names, or license
numbers. The commissioner may request supporting information and shall approve only projects
that comply with subdivisions 6 and 8, as defined by the Department of Education.
   (b) Districts may request funding for allowable projects based on self-assessments, safety
committee recommendations, insurance inspections, management assistance reports, fire marshal
orders, or other mandates. Notwithstanding subdivision 1, paragraph (b), and subdivision 8,
paragraph (b), for projects under $500,000, individual project size for projects authorized by this
subdivision is not limited and may include related work in multiple facilities. Health and safety
management costs from subdivision 8 may be reported as a single project.

   (c) All costs directly related to a project shall be reported in the appropriate Uniform Financial
Accounting and Reporting Standards (UFARS) finance code.
    (d) For fire and life safety egress and all other projects exceeding $20,000, cited under Minnesota
Fire Code, a fire marshal plan review is required.
   (e) Districts shall update project estimates with actual expenditures for each fiscal year. If a
project's final cost is significantly higher than originally approved, the commissioner may request
additional supporting information.
    Subd. 6c. Appeals process. In the event a district is denied funding approval for a project the
district believes complies with subdivisions 6 and 8, and is not otherwise excluded, a district may
appeal the decision. All such requests must be in writing. The commissioner shall respond in writing.
A written request must contain the following: project number; description and amount; reason for
denial; unresolved questions for consideration; reasons for reconsideration; and a specific statement
of what action the district is requesting.
    Subd. 7. Proration. In the event that the health and safety aid available for any year is prorated,
a district having its aid prorated may levy an additional amount equal to the amount not paid by the
state due to proration.
   Subd. 8. Health, safety, and environmental management cost. (a) "Health, safety, and
environmental management" is defined in section 123B.56.
     (b) A district's cost for health, safety, and environmental management is limited to the lesser of:
     (1) actual cost to implement their plan; or
     (2) an amount determined by the commissioner, based on enrollment, building age, and size.

    (b ) (c) The department may contract with regional service organizations, private contractors,
Minnesota Safety Council, or state agencies to provide management assistance to school districts for
health and safety capital projects. Management assistance is the development of written programs
for the identification, recognition and control of hazards, and prioritization and scheduling of district
health and safety capital projects. The d ­­

exclusively in one transportation category must be charged directly to the appropriate transportation
category. Transportation services provided by contractor-owned school bus companies incorporated
under different names but owned by the same individual or group of individuals must be treated as
the same company for cost allocation purposes.
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (d), districts contracting for transportation services are exempt
from the standard cost allocation method for authorized and nonauthorized transportation categories
if the district: (1) bids its contracts separately for authorized and nonauthorized transportation
categories and for special transportation separate from regular and excess transportation; (2)
receives bids or quotes from more than one vendor for these transportation categories; and (3) the
district's cost-per-mile does not vary more than ten percent among categories, excluding salaries
and fringe benefits of bus aides. If the costs reported by the district for contractor-owned operations
vary by more than ten percent among categories, the department shall require the district to
reallocate its transportation costs, excluding salaries and fringe benefits of bus aides, among all
categories.

                               EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION
    Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 119A.50, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Early childhood literacy programs. (a) A research-based early childhood literacy
program premised on actively involved parents, ongoing professional staff development, and high
quality early literacy program standards is established to increase the literacy skills of children
participating in Head Start to prepare them to be successful readers and to increase families'
participation in providing early literacy experiences to their children. Program providers must:
    (1) work to prepare children to be successful learners;
    (2) work to close the achievement gap for at-risk children;
64TH DAY]                                                MONDAY, MAY 23, 2011                                                                          3511

    (3) use an integrated approach to early literacy that daily offers a literacy-rich classroom
learning environment composed of books, writing materials, writing centers, labels, rhyming, and
other related literacy materials and opportunities;
     (4) support children's home language while helping the children master English and use multiple
literacy strategies to provide a cultural bridge between home and school;
    (5) use literacy mentors, ongoing literacy groups, and other teachers and staff to provide
appropriate, extensive professional development opportunities in early literacy and classroom
strategies for preschool teachers and other preschool staff;
   (6) use ongoing data-based assessments that enable preschool teachers to understand, plan, and
implement literacy strategies, activities, and curriculum that meet children's literacy needs and
continuously improve children's literacy; and
   (7) foster participation by parents, community stakeholders, literacy advisors, and evaluation
specialists.
Program providers are encouraged to collaborate with qualified, community-based early childhood
providers in implementing this program and to seek nonstate funds to supplement the program.
    (b) Program providers under paragraph (a) interested in extending literacy programs to children
in kindergarten through grade 3 may elect to form a partnership with an eligible organization under
section 124D.38, subdivision 2, or 124D.42, subdivision 6, clause (3), schools enrolling children
in kindergarten through grade 3, and other interested and qualified community-based entities to
provide ongoing literacy programs that offer seamless literacy instruction focused on closing
the literacy achievement gap. To close the literacy achievement gap by the end of third grade,
partnership members must agree to use best efforts and practices and to work collaboratively to
implement a seamless literacy model from age three to grade 3, consistent with paragraph (a).
Literacy programs under this paragraph must collect and use literacy data to:
      (1) evaluate children's literacy skills; and
    (2) formulate specific intervention strategies to provide reading instruction to children premised
on the outcomes of formative and summative assessments and research-based indicators of literacy
development.
   The literacy programs under this paragraph also must train teachers and other providers working
with children to use the assessment outcomes under clause (2) to develop and use effective,
long-term literacy coaching models that are specific to the program providers.

      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 121A.17, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
3512                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [64TH DAY

    Subd. 3. Screening program. (a) A screening program must include at least the following
components: developmental assessments, hearing and vision screening or referral, immunization
review and referral, the child's height and weight, identification of risk factors that may influence
learning, an interview with the parent about the child, and referral for assessment, diagnosis, and
treatment when potential needs are identified. The district and the person performing or supervising
the screening must provide a parent or guardian with clear written notice that the parent or guardian
may decline to answer questions or provide information about family circumstances that might
affect development and identification of risk factors that may influence learning. The notice must
state "Early childhood developmental screening helps a school district identify children who
may benefit from district and community resources available to help in their development. Early
childhood developmental screening includes a vision screening that helps detect potential eye
problems but is not a substitute for a comprehensive eye exam." The notice must clearly state that
declining to answer questions or provide information does not prevent the child from being enrolled
in kindergarten or first grade if all other screening components are met. If a parent or guardian
is not able to read and comprehend the written notice, the district and the person performing or
supervising the screening must convey the information in another manner. The notice must also
inform the parent or guardian that a child need not submit to the district screening program if the
child's health records indicate to the school that the child has received comparable developmental
screening performed within the preceding 365 days by a public or private health care organization
or individual health care provider. The notice must be given to a parent or guardian at the time the
district initially provides information to the parent or guardian about screening and must be given
again at the screening location.
    (b) All screening components shall be consistent with the standards of the state commissioner
of health for early developmental screening programs. A developmental screening program must
not provide laboratory tests or a physical examination to any child. The district must request from
the public or private health care organization or the individual health care provider the results of

under this section other than orders for dismissal shall be served on the respondent personally. Orders
for dismissal may be served personally or by certified mail. In lieu of personal service of an order for
protection, a law enforcement officer may serve a person with a short form notification as provided
in subdivision 8a.
    (b) When service is made out of this state and in the United States, it may be proved by the
affidavit of the person making the service. When service is made outside the United States, it may
be proved by the affidavit of the person making the service, taken before and certified by any United
States minister, charge d'affaires, commissioner, consul, or commercial agent, or other consular
or diplomatic officer of the United States appointed to reside in the other country, including all
deputies or other representatives of the officer authorized to perform their duties; or before an office
authorized to administer an oath with the certificate of an officer of a court of record of the country
in which the affidavit is taken as to the identity and authority of the officer taking the affidavit.
    (c) If personal service cannot be made, the court may order service of the petition and any order
issued under this section by alternate means, or by publication, which publication must be made as
in other actions. The application for alternate service must include the last known location of the
respondent; the petitioner's most recent contacts with the respondent; the last known location of the
respondent's employment; the names and locations of the respondent's parents, siblings, children,
and other close relatives; the names and locations of other persons who are likely to know the
respondent's whereabouts; and a description of efforts to locate those persons.
    The court shall consider the length of time the respondent's location has been unknown, the
likelihood that the respondent's location will become known, the nature of the relief sought, and
the nature of efforts made to locate the respondent. The court shall order service by first class mail,
forwarding address requested, to any addresses where there is a reasonable possibility that mail or

information will be forwarded or communicated to the respondent.
    The court may also order publication, within or without the state, but only if it might reasonably
succeed in notifying the respondent of the proceeding. Service shall be deemed complete 14 days
after mailing or 14 days after court-ordered publication.
    (d) A petition and any order issued under this section, including the short form notification, must
include a notice to the respondent that if an order for protection is issued to protect the petitioner
or a child of the parties, upon request of the petitioner in any parenting time proceeding, the court
shall consider the order for protection in making a decision regarding parenting time.

sections referenced in this section apply only with respect to events and circumstances occurring
after July 31, 1999. A section referenced in this section does not invalidate the declarations, bylaws
or condominium plats of condominiums created before August 1, 1999. But all sections referenced
in this section prevail over the declarations, bylaws, CIC plats, rules and regulations under them,
of condominiums created before August 1, 1999, except to the extent that this chapter defers to the
declarations, bylaws, CIC plats, or rules and regulations issued under them.
    (3) This chapter shall not apply to cooperatives and planned communities created prior to June
1, 1994, or to planned communities that were created on or after June 1, 1994, and before August
1, 2006, and that consist of more than two but fewer than 13 units; except by election pursuant to
subsection (d), and except that sections 515B.1-116, subsections (a), (c), (d), and (e), 515B.4-107,
and 515B.4-108, apply to all planned communities and cooperatives regardless of when they are
created, unless they are exempt under subsection (e).
    (c) This chapter shall not invalidate any amendment to the declaration, bylaws or condominium
plat of any condominium created under chapter 515 or 515A if the amendment was recorded before
June 1, 1994. Any amendment recorded on or after June 1, 1994, shall be adopted in conformity
with the procedures and requirements specified by those instruments and by this chapter. If the
amendment grants to any person any rights, powers or privileges permitted by this chapter, all
correlative obligations, liabilities and restrictions contained in this chapter shall also apply to that
person.
    (d) Any condominium created under chapter 515, any planned community or cooperative which
would be exempt from this chapter under subsection (e), or any planned community or cooperative
created prior to June 1, 1994, or any planned community that was created on or after June 1, 1994,
and prior to August 1, 2006, and that consists of more than two but fewer than 13 units, may elect
to be subject to this chapter, as follows:
    (1) The election shall be accomplished by recording a declaration or amended declaration, and
a new or amended CIC plat where required, and by approving bylaws or amended bylaws, which
conform to the requirements of this chapter, and which, in the case of amendments, are adopted in
conformity with the procedures and requirements specified by the existing declaration and bylaws
of the common interest community, and by any applicable statutes.
    (2) In a condominium, the preexisting condominium plat shall be the CIC plat and an amended
CIC plat shall be required only if the amended declaration or bylaws contain provisions inconsistent
with the preexisting condominium plat. The condominium's CIC number shall be the apartment
ownership number or condominium number originally assigned to it by the recording officer. In a
cooperative in which the unit owners' interests are characterized as real estate, a CIC plat shall be
required. In a planned community, the preexisting plat or registered land survey recorded pursuant to
chapter 505, 508, or 508A, or the part of the plat or registered land survey upon which the common
interest community is located, shall be the CIC plat.
   (3) The amendment shall comply with section 515B.2-118(a)(3) and (c); except that the
unanimous consent of the unit owners shall not be required for (i) a clarification of the unit
boundary description if the clarified boundary description is substantially consistent with the
preexisting CIC plat, or (ii) changes from common elements to limited common elements that
occur by operation of section 515B.2-109(c) and (d).
   (4) Except as permitted by paragraph (3), no declarant, affiliate of declarant, association, master

association nor unit owner may acquire, increase, waive, reduce or revoke any previously existing
warranty rights or causes of action that one of said persons has against any other of said persons by
reason of exercising the right of election under this subsection.

interest community, a lessor who possesses no special declarant rights and who is not an affiliate
of a declarant who possesses special declarant rights, or (B) any person who reserves, or succeeds
under section 515B.3-104 to any special declarant rights; or

those powers on behalf of one or more property owners' associations described in section
515B.2-121(b)(iv). A person (i) hired by an association to perform maintenance, repair, accounting,
bookkeeping or management services, or (ii) granted authority under an instrument recorded

collectively will be a separate common interest community.

a cooperative, a lender's interest in a member's ownership interest in the association, a pledgee's
interest in the pledge of an ownership interest, or any other interest intended as security for an
obligation under a written agreement.
    (33a) This definition of special declarant rights applies only to common interest communities
created before August 1, 2010. "Special declarant rights" means rights reserved in the declaration

    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 515B.1-116, is amended to read:
    515B.1-116 RECORDING.
    (a) A declaration, bylaws, a supplemental declaration, any amendment to a declaration,
supplemental declaration, or bylaws, and any other instrument affecting a common interest
community shall be entitled to be recorded. In those counties which have a tract index, the county
recorder shall enter the declaration in the tract index for each unit or other tract affected. The
county recorder shall not enter the declaration in the tract index for lands described as additional
real estate, unless such lands are added to the common interest community pursuant to section
515B.2-111. The registrar of titles shall file the declaration in accordance with section 508.351 or
508A.351. The registrar of titles shall not file the declaration upon certificates of title for lands
described as additional real estate, unless such lands are added to the common interest community
pursuant to section 515B.2-111.
   (b) The recording officer shall upon request promptly assign a number (CIC number) to a
common interest community to be formed or to a common interest community resulting from the
merger of two or more common interest communities.
    (c) Documents recorded pursuant to this chapter shall in the case of registered land be filed, and
references to the recording of documents shall mean filed in the case of registered land.
     (d) Except as provided in section 515B.2-109, 515B.2-112, 515B.2-114, or 515B.2-124, if a
recorded document relating to a common interest community or a master association purports to
require a certain vote or signatures approving any restatement or amendment of the document by a
certain number or percentage of unit owners or secured parties, and if the amendment or restatement
is to be recorded, an affidavit of the president or secretary of the association stating that the required
vote or signatures have been obtained shall be attached to the document to be recorded and shall
constitute prima facie evidence of the representations contained therein.
    (e) Except as permitted under this subsection, a recording officer shall not file or record a
declaration creating a new common interest community, unless the county treasurer has certified
that the property taxes payable in the current year for the real estate included in the proposed
common interest community have been paid. This certification is in addition to the certification
for delinquent taxes required by section 272.12. In the case of preexisting common interest
communities, the recording officer shall accept, file, and record the following instruments, without
requiring a certification as to the current or delinquent taxes on any of the units in the common
interest community: (i) a declaration or amended declaration subjecting the common interest
community to this chapter; (ii) a declaration changing the form of a common interest community
pursuant to section 515B.2-123; or (iii) an amendment to or restatement of the declaration, bylaws,
or CIC plat; provided, that if the declaration, amendment, or restatement changes the boundaries
of an existing tax parcel, then the recording officer shall require a certification as to the payment of
current and delinquent taxes on any tax parcel the boundaries of which are changed. ­                      In

    515B.2-109 COMMON ELEMENTS AND LIMITED COMMON ELEMENTS.
   (a) Except as limited by the declaration or this chapter, common elements other than limited
common elements may be used in common by all unit owners. Limited common elements are
designated for the exclusive use of the unit owners of the unit or units to which the limited common
elements are allocated, subject to subsection (b) and the rights of the association as set forth in the
declaration, the bylaws or this chapter.
   (b) Except for the limited common elements described in subsections (c) and (d), the declaration
shall specify to which unit or units each limited common element is allocated.
   (c) Unless otherwise provided in the declaration, if any chute, flue, duct, wire, pipe, conduit,
bearing wall, bearing column, or other fixture or improvement: (i) serves one or more but fewer
than all units and is located wholly or partially outside the unit boundaries, it is a limited common
element allocated solely to the unit or units served; (ii) serves all units or any portion of the common
elements, it is a part of the common elements; or (iii) serves only the unit and is located wholly
within the unit boundaries, it is a part of the unit.
   (d) Unless otherwise provided in the declaration, improvements such as shutters, awnings,
window boxes, doorsteps, stoops, porches, balconies, decks, patios, perimeter doors and windows,
and their frames, constructed as part of the original construction to serve a single unit or units, and
authorized replacements and modifications thereof, if located wholly or partially outside the unit
boundaries, are limited common elements allocated solely to the unit or units served.
     (e) If the declaration so provides, and subject to any different licensing provisions in a
declaration recorded before August 1, 2010, the declarant may grant to a unit owner an exclusive
license for the use of a common element originally designed and constructed to serve as a garage
stall, storage locker, or other similar common element space, in which case the common element
license shall be deemed to be appurtenant to the unit owner's unit, subject to transfer if so provided
by the declaration. The declarant shall, at the time the license is granted, provide to the ­
                                                                                            a­

If the declaration so provides, the declarant may require the onetime payment to the declarant of a
consideration for the grant of a license.
     (1) A common element license may be held only by a unit owner, and the purported transfer of
a license to a person other than a unit owner shall be void. Except as provided in the declaration or
this subsection, no interest in the common element license may be held or transferred separate from
the unit,­­­nd

    (a) A CIC plat is required for condominiums and planned communities, and cooperatives
in which the unit owners' interests are characterized as real estate. The CIC plat is a part of
the declaration in condominiums, in planned communities utilizing a CIC plat complying with
subsection (c), and in cooperatives in which the unit owners' interests are characterized as real
estate, but need not be physically attached to the declaration.
    (1) In a condominium, or a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests are characterized as
real estate, the CIC plat shall comply with subsection (c).
    (2) In a planned community, a CIC plat that does not comply with subsection (c) shall consist
of all or part of a subdivision plat or registered land survey complying with subsection (d), or
any combination thereof. The CIC plat or registered land survey need not contain the number
of the common interest community and may be recorded at any time before the recording of the
declaration; provided that if the CIC plat complies with subsection (c), the number of the common
interest community shall be included and the CIC plat shall be recorded at the time of recording of
the declaration.
    (3) In a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests are characterized as personal property,
a CIC plat shall not be required. In lieu of a CIC plat, the declaration or any amendment to it
creating, converting, or subdividing units in a personal property cooperative shall include an exhibit
containing a scale drawing of each building, identifying each building, and showing the perimeter
walls of each unit created or changed by the declaration or any amendment to it, including the unit's
unit identifier, and its location within the building if the building contains more than one unit.
    (b) The CIC plat, or supplemental or amended CIC plat, for condominiums, for planned
communities using a plat complying with subsection (c), and for cooperatives in which the
unit owners' interests are characterized as real estate, shall contain certifications by a licensed
professional land surveyor and licensed professional architect, as to the parts of the CIC plat
prepared by each, that (i) the CIC plat accurately depicts all information required by this section,
and (ii) the work was undertaken by, or reviewed and approved by, the certifying land surveyor
or architect. The portions of the CIC plat depicting the dimensions of the portions of the common
interest community described in subsection (c), clauses (8), (9), (10), and (12), may be prepared by
either a land surveyor or an architect. The other portions of the CIC plat shall be prepared only by
a land surveyor. A certification of the CIC plat or supplemental CIC plat, or an amendment to it,
under this subsection by an architect is not required if all parts of the CIC plat, supplemental CIC
plat, or amendment are prepared by a land surveyor. Certification by the land surveyor or architect
does not constitute a guaranty or warranty of the nature, suitability, or quality of construction of
any improvements located or to be located in the common interest community.

   (c) A CIC plat for a condominium, or a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests are
characterized as real estate, shall show:
   (1) the number of the common interest community, and the boundaries, dimensions, and legally
sufficient description of the land included therein;
   (2) the dimensions and location of all existing material structural improvements and roadways;
    (3) the intended location and dimensions of any contemplated common element improvements
to be constructed within the common interest community after the filing of the CIC plat, labeled
either "MUST BE BUILT" or "NEED NOT BE BUILT";
   (4) the location and dimensions of any additional real estate, labeled as such, and a legally
sufficient description of the additional real estate;
   (5) the extent of any encroachments by or upon any portion of the common interest community;
   (6) the location and dimensions of all recorded easements within the land included in the
common interest community burdening any portion of the land;
   (7) the distance and direction between noncontiguous parcels of real estate;
   (8) the location and dimensions of limited common elements, except that with respect to limited
common elements described in section 515B.2-102, subsections (d) and (f), only such material
limited common elements as porches, balconies, decks, patios, and garages shall be shown;
    (9) the location and dimensions of the front, rear, and side boundaries of each unit and that unit's
unit identifier;
    (10) the location and dimensions of the upper and lower boundaries of each unit with reference
to an established or assumed datum and that unit's unit identifier;
    (11) a legally sufficient description of any real estate in which the unit owners will own only an
estate for years, labeled as "leasehold real estate"; and
   (12) any units which may be converted by the declarant to create additional units or common
elements identified separately.
   (d) A CIC plat for a planned community either shall comply with subsection (c), or it shall:
   (1) comply with chapter 505, 508, or 508A, as applicable; and
   (2) comply with the applicable subdivision requirements of any governmental authority within
whose jurisdiction the planned community is located, subject to the limitations set forth in section
515B.1-106.
    (e) If a declarant adds additional real estate, the declarant shall record a supplemental CIC plat or
plats for the real estate being added, conforming to the requirements of this section which apply to the
type of common interest community in question. If less than all additional real estate is being added,
the supplemental CIC plat for a condominium, a planned community whose CIC plat complies with
subsection (c), or a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests are characterized as real estate
shall also show the location and dimensions of the remaining portion.

   (f) If, pursuant to section 515B.2-112, a declarant subdivides or converts any unit into two or
more units, common elements, or limited common elements, or combines two or more units, the
declarant shall record an amendment to the CIC plat showing the location and dimensions of any
new units, common elements, or limited common elements thus created.

subsection (c), and in cooperatives in which the unit owners' interests are characterized as real
estate, but need not be physically attached to the declaration.
   (1) In a condominium, a planned community not utilizing a subdivision plat or registered land
survey under subsection (d), clause (1), or a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests are
characterized as real estate, the CIC plat shall comply with subsection (c).
    (2) In a planned community, a CIC plat that does not comply with subsection (c) shall consist
of all or part of a subdivision plat or registered land survey complying with subsection (d), or any
combination thereof. The CIC subdivision plat or registered land survey need not contain the number
of the common interest community and may be recorded at any time before the recording of the
declaration; provided that if the CIC plat complies with subsection (c), the number of the common
interest community shall be included and the CIC plat shall be recorded at the time of recording of
the declaration.
    (3) In a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests are characterized as personal property,
a CIC plat shall not be required. In lieu of a CIC plat, the declaration, or any amendment or
supplemental declaration creating, converting, or subdividing units shall include an exhibit
containing a dimensioned, scale drawing showing (i) the boundaries of the land constituting the
cooperative property, (ii) the location and dimensions of the front, rear, and side boundaries of each
unit, and (iii) the unit's unit identifier and its location within the cooperative property.
    (b) The CIC plat or supplemental or amended CIC plat for condominiums, for planned
communities using a plat complying with subsection (c), and for cooperatives in which the
unit owners' interests are characterized as real estate shall contain certifications by a licensed
professional land surveyor and licensed professional architect, as to the parts of the CIC plat
prepared by each, that (i) the CIC plat accurately depicts all information required by this section,
and (ii) the work was undertaken by, or reviewed and approved by, the certifying land surveyor
or architect. The portions of the CIC plat depicting the dimensions of the portions of the common
interest community described in subsection (c), clauses (8), (9), and (10), may be prepared by
either a land surveyor or an architect. The other portions of the CIC plat shall be prepared only by
a land surveyor. A certification of the CIC plat or supplemental CIC plat, or an amendment to it,
under this subsection by an architect is not required if all parts of the CIC plat, supplemental CIC
plat, or amendment are prepared by a land surveyor. Certification by the land surveyor or architect

does not constitute a guaranty or warranty of the nature, suitability, or quality of construction of
any improvements located or to be located in the common interest community.
    (c) A CIC plat for a condominium, a planned community not utilizing a subdivision plat or
registered land survey under subsection (d), clause (1), or a cooperative in which the unit owners'
interests are characterized as real estate shall show:
   (1) the number of the common interest community, and the boundaries, dimensions, and a legally
sufficient description of the land included therein;
    (2) the dimensions and location of all existing roadways and material structural improvements
that are part of the common elements;
    (3) the intended location and dimensions of all roadways and material structural improvements
that may be constructed by the declarant within the common elements after the filing of the CIC
plat, labeled either "MUST BE BUILT" or "NEED NOT BE BUILT";
   (4) the location and dimensions of any additional real estate, labeled as such, and a legally
sufficient description of the additional real estate;

common elements described in section 515B.2-109, subsections (c) and (d), only such material
limited common elements as porches, balconies, decks, and patios shall be shown;
    (9) the location and dimensions of the front, rear, and side boundaries of each unit and that unit's
unit identifier;
    (10) the location and dimensions of the upper and lower boundaries of each unit with reference
to an established or assumed datum and that unit's unit identifier; and
    (11) a legally sufficient description of any real estate in which the unit owners will own only an
estate for years, labeled as "leasehold real estate."
   (d) A CIC plat for a planned community either shall comply with subsection (c), or it shall:
   (1) comply with chapter 505, 508, or 508A, as applicable; and
   (2) comply with the applicable subdivision requirements of any governmental authority within
whose jurisdiction the planned community is located, subject to the limitations set forth in section

    (e) If a declarant adds additional real estate, the declarant shall record a supplemental CIC plat
or plats for the real estate being added, conforming to the requirements of this section which apply

   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 515B.2-121, is amended to read:
   515B.2-121 MASTER ASSOCIATIONS.
    (a) A master association formed after June 1, 1994, shall be organized as a Minnesota profit,
nonprofit or cooperative corporation. A master association shall be incorporated prior to the
delegation to it of any powers under this chapter.
    (b) The members of the master association shall be any combination of (i) unit owners, (ii)
associations, (iii) master associations, or (iv) owners of real estate or property owners' associations
not subject to this chapter but only in combination with at least one other category of member.
An association or its members may be members of an entity created before June 1, 1994, which
performs functions similar to those performed by a master association regardless of whether the
entity is subject to this chapter.
    (c) A master association shall be governed by a master board. Except as expressly prohibited
by the master declaration, the master association's articles of incorporation or bylaws, or other
provisions of this chapter, the master board may act in all instances on behalf of the master
association. The directors of a master association shall be elected or, if a nonprofit corporation,
elected or appointed, in a manner consistent with the requirements of the statute under which the
master association is formed and of the master association's articles of incorporation and bylaws,
and subject to the following:
    (1) The master declaration may provide for a period of master developer control of the master
association during which a master developer or a person designated by the master developer may
appoint and remove the officers and directors of the master association. The period of master
developer control begins on the date of the recording of the master declaration and terminates upon
the earliest of the following events:
   (i) the voluntary surrender of the right to appoint directors;
    (ii) the date ten years after the date the master declaration is recorded, unless extended by an
amendment to the master declaration approved in writing by the master developer, and by 67 percent
of the votes of members other than the master developer;
   (iii) the termination date, if any, in the master declaration; or
    (iv) the date when at least 75 percent of the total units and other parcels of real estate referred
to in subsection (e)(1)(vii) have been conveyed to persons other than a master developer, master
association, declarant, or association.
    (2) Upon the termination of the period of master developer control, the master board shall cause
a meeting of the members of the master association to be called and held within 60 days after
said termination, at which time the directors shall be elected by all members, including the master
3538                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [64TH DAY

developer if a member. If the master board fails or refuses to call a meeting of the unit owners
required to be called by this subsection, then the members other than the master developer and
its affiliates, if they are members, may cause the meeting to be called pursuant to the applicable
provisions of the statute under which the master association was created. If the master developer
or its affiliates are members, they shall be deemed to be present at the meeting for purposes of
establishing a quorum regardless of their failure to attend the meeting. The master board shall
thereafter be subject to the following:
    (i) unless otherwise approved by a vote of members other than the master developer or an affiliate
of the master developer, a majority of the directors shall be members, or a natural person designated
by a member that is not a natural person, other than the master developer or an affiliate of the master
developer;
    (ii) subject to the requirements of subsection (c)(2)(i), the articles of incorporation or bylaws
may authorize the master developer or a person designated by the master developer to appoint one
director, who need not be a member. The articles of incorporation or bylaws shall not be amended
to change or terminate the authorization to appoint one director without the written consent of the
master developer or other person possessing the power to appoint; and
    (iii) subject to the requirements of subsection (c)(2)(i), the articles of incorporation or bylaws
may authorize special classes of directors and director voting rights, as follows: (A) classes of
directors, (B) the appointment or election of directors in certain classes by certain classes of
members, or (C) class voting by classes of directors on issues affecting only a certain class or
classes of members, units, or other parcels of real estate, or to otherwise protect the legitimate
interests of such class or classes. No person may utilize such special classes or class voting for the
purpose of evading any limitation imposed by this chapter on master developers or declarants.
    (d) Subject to subsection (c)(1), the officers of a master association shall be elected, appointed,
or designated in a manner consistent with the statute under which the master association is formed
and consistent with the master association articles of incorporation and bylaws.
   (e) The creation and authority of a master association shall be governed by the following
requirements:
   (1) A master declaration shall be recorded in connection with the creation of a master association.
The master declaration shall be executed by the owners of the real estate subjected to the master
declaration and by the master developer if not an owner. The master declaration shall contain, at a
minimum:
   (i) the name of the master association;
   (ii) a legally sufficient description of the real estate which is subject to the master declaration,
identifying any interest in the real estate which will be owned by the master association, and a legally
sufficient description of any other real estate which may be subjected to the master declaration
pursuant to subsection (f);
   (iii) a statement as to whether the real estate subject to, and which may be subjected to, the
master declaration collectively is or collectively will be a separate common interest community;
   (iv) a description of the members of the master association;
64TH DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 23, 2011                                          3539

    (v) a description of the master association's powers. To the extent described in the master
declaration, a master association has the powers with respect to the master association's members
and the property subject to the master declaration that section 515B.3-102 grants to an association
with respect to the association's members and the property subject to the declaration. A master
association also has the powers delegated to it by an association pursuant to subsection (e)(2)
or by a property owners' association not subject to the chapter; provided (A) that the master
declaration identifies the powers and authorizes the delegation either expressly or by a grant
of authority to the master board of the association or property owners' association and (B) that
the master association board has not refused the delegation pursuant to subsection (e)(4). The
provisions of the declarations of the common interest communities, or the provisions of recorded
instruments governing other property subject to the master declaration, that delegate powers to the
master association shall be consistent with the provisions of the master declaration that govern the
delegation of the powers;
    (vi) a description of the formulas governing the allocation of assessments and member voting
rights, including any special classes or class voting referred to in subsection (c);
    (vii) a statement, based upon the master developer's good faith estimate, of the total number
of units and other parcels of real estate intended for ownership by persons other than a master
developer, master association, declarant, or association that are (A) subject to the master declaration
as initially recorded and (B) intended to be created by the addition of real estate or by the subdivision
of units or other parcels of real estate; and
   (viii) the requirements for amendment of the master declaration, other than an amendment under
subsection (f).
   (2) The declaration of a common interest community located on property subject to a master
declaration may:
   (i) delegate any of the powers described in section 515B.3-102 to the master association;
provided, that a delegation of the powers described in section 515B.3-102(a)(2) is effective only if
expressly stated in the declaration; and
   (ii) authorize the m
                      ­­a­
                         s­e
                          t­­r board to delegate any of the powers described in section 515B.3-102,
except for the powers described in section 515B.3-102(a)(2), to the master association.
    (3) With respect to any other property subject to a master association, there need not be an
instrument other than the master declaration recorded against the property to empower the master
association to exercise powers with respect to the property.
    (4) If a declaration or other recorded instrument authorizes the master board or the board of
a property owners' association to delegate powers to a master association, the master board may
refuse any delegation of powers that does not comply with (i) this chapter, (ii) the declaration or
other recorded instrument, or (iii) the organizational documents of the master association.
    (5) The failure of a declaration, a master board, or an owner of property subject to a master
association to properly delegate some or all of the powers to the master association does not affect
the authority of the master association to exercise those and other powers with respect to other
common interest communities or owners of properties that are subject to the master association.
   (6) Any interest in the real estate subject to a master declaration that subsection (e)(1)(ii) or
3540                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [64TH DAY

(f) indicates will be owned by the master association shall be conveyed to the master association
immediately after the recording of the master declaration or amendment to the master declaration,
as applicable.
   (f) If the master declaration so provides, other real estate may be subjected to the master
declaration. The other real estate shall be subjected to the master declaration by an amendment
executed (i) by the master developer and (ii) by the owner of the other real estate. The amendment
shall identify any ownership interest in the other real estate that will be owned by the master
association.
   (g) Sections 515B.3-103(a), (b), and (g), 515B.3-108, 515B.3-109, 515B.3-110, and 515B.3-112
shall apply in the conduct of the affairs of a master association. But the rights of voting, notice, and
other rights enumerated in those sections apply to persons who elect or appoint the directors of a
master board, whether or not those persons are otherwise unit owners within the meaning of this
chapter.
   (h) If so provided in the master declaration, a master association may levy assessments for
common expenses of the master association against its members and the property subject to the
master declaration, and have and foreclose liens securing the assessments. The assessment liens
shall have the same priority against secured parties, shall include the same fees and charges, and
may be foreclosed in the same manner, as assessment liens under section 515B.3-116. The master
association's lien shall have priority as against the lien of an association or property owners'
association subject to the master association, regardless of when the lien arose or was perfected.
    (1) Master association common expenses shall be allocated among the members of the master
association in a fair and equitable manner. If the members include associations or property
owners' associations, then the master assessments may be allocated among and levied against the
associations or property owners' associations, or allocated among and levied against the units or
other parcels of real estate owned by the members of the association or property owners' association.
If so provided in the master declaration, master assessments levied against a member association
or property owners' association are allocated among and levied against the units or other parcels of
real estate owned by the members of the association or property owners' association. If applicable
and appropriate, the formulas and principles described in section 515B.2-108, subsections (b),
(c), (d), and (e), shall be used in making the allocations. The assessment formulas and procedures
described in the declarations of any common interest communities or any instruments governing
other real estate subject to the master association shall not conflict with the formulas and procedures
described in the master declaration.
    (2) Subject to subsection (i), the master declaration may exempt from liability for all or a
portion of master association assessments any person authorized by subsection (c)(1) to appoint
the members of the master board, or any other person, and exempt any unit or other parcel of real
estate owned by the person from a lien for such assessments, until the building containing the unit,
or located within the boundaries of the unit or other parcel of real estate, is substantially completed.
Substantial completion shall be evidenced by a certificate of occupancy in a jurisdiction that issues
that certificate.
    (i) A master association shall not be used, directly or indirectly, to avoid or nullify any warranties
or other obligations for which a declarant of a common interest community subject to the master
association is responsible, or to otherwise avoid the requirements of this chapter.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2011.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 515B.2-124, is amended to read:
   515B.2-124 SEVERANCE OF COMMON INTEREST COMMUNITY.
   (a) Unless the declaration provides otherwise, a part of a common interest community
containing one or more units, with or without common elements, may be severed from the
common interest community, subject to the requirements of this section. Subject to any additional
requirements contained in the declaration, the severance shall be approved in a written severance
agreement complying with this section, executed by:
    (1) unit owners entitled to cast at least 67 percent of the votes in the association, which approval
shall include the approval of unit owners entitled to cast a majority of the votes allocated to units
in the remaining common interest community and the approval of unit owners entitled to cast a
majority of the votes allocated to units in the part of the common interest community being severed;
   (2) declarant until the earlier of five years after the recording of the declaration or the time at
which declarant no longer owns an unsold unit; and
    (3) in the case of a cooperative, all holders of mortgages or contracts for deed on the entire real
estate constituting the cooperative.
    (b) The declaration may specify a smaller percentage for unit owner approval only if all of the
units are restricted to nonresidential use.
    (c) The severance agreement shall specify a severance date by which the severance of the
common interest community shall be accomplished, after which the severance agreement is void.
The severance agreement shall be deemed to grant to the association a power of attorney coupled
with an interest to effect the severance of the common interest community on behalf of the unit
owners and the holders of all other interests in the units, including without limitations the power
to execute the amendment to the declaration, any instruments of conveyance, and all related
instruments.
   (d) The severance agreement shall:
    (1) Approve an amendment to the declaration complying with this chapter, in substantially
the same form to be recorded, and an amendment to the CIC plat if required. The declaration
amendment shall, at a minimum, (i) legally describe the real estate constituting the remaining
common interest community and the real estate being severed, (ii) restate the number of units
in the remaining common interest community, (iii) reallocate the interests of the unit owners in
the remaining common interest community among the remaining units in accordance with the
allocation formula set forth in the declaration, and (iv) recite any easements to which the severed
portion of the common interest community remains subject.
    (2) Approve an amendment to the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the remaining common
interest community, if necessary.
    (3) Authorize the association to execute and record the amended declaration, articles of
incorporation or bylaws on behalf of the unit owners and all other persons holding an interest in
the remaining common interest community, and to take other actions necessary to accomplish the
3542                                       JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                               [64TH DAY

severance of the common interest community.
    (4) Allocate the assets and liabilities of the association between the association and (i) a new
association formed pursuant to subsection (g), or (ii) the owners of the units being severed, subject
to a lien against their interest in the severed real estate or their share in the assets of the association
in favor of any person that held a security interest in their unit.
    (5) If the units that are being severed from the common interest community will not be included
in a new common interest community that is (i) formed simultaneously with the severance of the
common interest community, and (ii) includes all of the units and substantially all of the common
elements being severed, then the agreement shall contain the written consent of holders of first
mortgages on all units that are being severed, and shall describe in detail the proposed disposition
of all real estate to be severed and all assets of the association allocated to the severed units, and the
distribution of the proceeds of the disposition, if any, consistent with subsection (i).
    (e) The severance agreement or a memorandum of it shall be recorded in every county in which
a part of the common interest community is located. The recording of the severance agreement or
memorandum of it shall, from the date of recording, constitute notice to all persons subsequently
acquiring an interest in the common interest community that the common interest community is
being severed, and that those persons acquire their interests subject to the terms and conditions
contained in the severance agreement and the amendment to the declaration.
    (f) The amendment to the declaration of the remaining common interest community shall be
recorded on or before the severance date or the severance agreement and the amendment to the
declaration are void as of the day after the severance date. The recording of the amendment to the
declaration shall complete the severance of the common interest community and release the severed
part of the common interest community from the declaration without further action by any person.

     (a) A special declarant right created or reserved under this chapter may be voluntarily transferred
only by a separate instrument evidencing the transfer recorded in every county in which any part
of the common interest community is located. The separate instrument shall be recorded against
all units in the common interest community, or in the case of a cooperative, against the real estate
owned by the cooperative, or in the case of a condominium on registered land, the instrument must
be filed pursuant to section 508.351, subdivision 3, or 508A.351, subdivision 3. The instrument may
provide for the conveyance of less than all of the special declarant rights, and is not effective unless
executed by the transferor and transferee. A deed in lieu of foreclosure, or other conveyance arising
out of a foreclosure or cancellation, shall not be deemed a voluntary transfer within the meaning of
this section.
   (b) Upon the voluntary transfer of any special declarant right, the liability of a transferor
declarant is as follows:
    (1) A transferor is not relieved of any obligation or liability arising before the transfer and
remains liable for warranty obligations imposed on the transferor by this chapter. Lack of privity
does not deprive any unit owner of standing to maintain an action to enforce any obligation of the
transferor.
    (2) If a successor to any special declarant right is an affiliate of a declarant, the transferor is jointly
and severally liable with the successor for any obligations or liabilities of the successor relating to
the common interest community.
    (3) If a transferor retains any special declarant rights, but transfers other special declarant rights
to a successor who is not an affiliate of the declarant, the transferor is liable for any obligations or
liabilities imposed on a declarant by this chapter or by the declaration relating to the retained special
declarant rights and arising before or after the transfer.
    (4) A transferor has no liability for any act or omission or any breach of a contractual or warranty
obligation arising from the exercise of a special declarant right by a successor declarant who is not
an affiliate of the transferor.
    (c) Upon the voluntary transfer of any special declarant right, the liability of a successor declarant
is as follows:
    (1) A successor to any special declarant right who is an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all
obligations and liabilities imposed on the transferor by this chapter or the declaration.
    (2) A successor to any special declarant right who is not an affiliate of a declarant is subject to
all obligations and liabilities imposed by this chapter or by the declaration, except:
     (i) misrepresentations by any previous declarant;
   (ii) warranty obligations on improvements made by any previous declarant, or made before the
common interest community was created;
    (iii) breach of any fiduciary obligation by any previous declarant or the declarant's appointees
to the board;

   (iv) any liability or obligation imposed on the transferor as a result of the transferor's acts or
omissions after the transfer; and
   (v) any liability arising out of a special declarant right which was not transferred as provided in
subsection (a).
    (d) In case of foreclosure of a mortgage or cancellation of a contract for deed or other security
interest (or conveyance in lieu thereof), sale by a trustee under an agreement creating a security
interest, tax sale, judicial sale, or sale under bankruptcy code or receivership proceedings, of any
units or additional real estate, or interest therein, owned by a declarant, a person acquiring title to the
property or interests succeeds to all special declarant rights related to the property or interests held by
that declarant and acquired by it unless (i) the mortgage instrument or other instrument creating the
security interest, (ii) the instrument conveying title, or (iii) a separate instrument signed by the person
and recorded within 60 days after the person acquires title to the property or interests, provides for
transfer of less than all special declarant rights. The separate instrument need be recorded only
against the title to the units or interests other than those being acquired under this subsection, or in
the case of a cooperative, against the real estate owned by the cooperative. The declarant shall cease
to have or exercise any special declarant rights which are transferred. If the person has limited the
transfer of certain special declarant rights as provided in this subsection, then it and its successor's
liability shall be limited, as follows:
    (1) If the person or its successor limits its rights and liabilities only to maintain models, sales
office and signs, and if that party is not an affiliate of a declarant, it is not subject to any liability or
obligations as a declarant, except the obligation to provide a disclosure statement and any liability
arising from that obligation, and it may not exercise any other special declarant rights.
    (2) If the person or its successor is not an affiliate of a declarant, it may declare its intention
in a recorded instrument as provided in subsection (a) to acquire all special declarant rights and
hold those rights solely for transfer to another person. Thereafter, until the special declarant rights
are transferred to a person acquiring title to any unit owned by the successor, or until a separate
instrument is recorded permitting exercise of all of those rights, that successor may not exercise any
of those rights other than the right to control the board of directors in accordance with the provisions
of section 515B.3-103 for the duration of any period of declarant control. So long as any successor
may not exercise its special declarant rights under this subsection, it is not subject to any liability or
obligation as a declarant other than liability for its acts and omissions under section 515B.3-103.
    (e) Any attempted exercise by a purported successor to a special declarant right which is not
transferred as provided in this section is void, and any purported successor attempting to exercise
that right shall be liable for any damages arising out of its actions.
    (f) Nothing in this section shall subject any successor to a special declarant right to any claims
against or other obligations of a transferor declarant, other than claims and obligations arising under
this chapter, or the declaration or bylaws.
  (g) This section applies only to transfers of special declarant rights that are effective before
August 1, 2010.

    Sec. 11. [515B.3-1041] SPECIAL DECLARANT RIGHTS; TRANSFER OF SPECIAL
3550                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [64TH DAY

DECLARANT RIGHTS, LIABILITY OF TRANSFEROR AND TRANSFEREE, AND
TERMINATION.
    (a) Except as set forth in subsection (b) or (c), a special declarant right, as defined in section
515B.1-103(33b), does not run with title and may only be transferred pursuant to a separate transfer
instrument, titled a "Transfer of Special Declarant Rights," that both the transferor and the transferee
execute.
    (1) A transfer shall be recorded in compliance with applicable law, and is not effective unless the
transferee is the owner of record of a unit or additional real estate at the time the transfer is recorded.
Transfers recorded on or after the effective date of this section shall be recorded against title to all
units in the common interest community.
   (2) A transferor may transfer fewer than all of the special declarant rights the transferor holds
provided that any special declarant rights not transferred are subject to item (i).
    (3) If as a result of a transfer there will be multiple declarants holding special declarant rights, the
transfer shall describe the allocation of each special declarant right between or among the transferor
and each transferee, including, at a minimum, a description of the units or additional real estate to
which the respective special declarant rights apply and the name and address of the owner or owners
of record of the respective units or additional real estate at the time the transfer is recorded.
    (b) If a declarant's ownership interest in a unit, or in additional real estate that may become
subject to the declaration pursuant to the exercise of a special declarant right, is transferred to
another person as a result of the foreclosure, termination, or cancellation of a security interest,
foreclosure of a judgment lien, tax judgment sale, tax forfeited land sale, sale or transfer under
bankruptcy code or receivership proceedings, or other sale or transfer approved by a court, or
is transferred by a deed in lieu of foreclosure, then all special declarant rights that are reserved
to the declarant in the declaration and that relate to the units or additional real estate transferred
are automatically transferred to the person acquiring title from the declarant, and the transfer is
effective as to all special declarant rights, unless or until: (i) the security instrument in the case
of the foreclosure, termination, or cancellation of a security interest, (ii) the instrument effecting
the involuntary transfer, or (iii) a separate instrument executed by the transferee and recorded in
compliance with applicable law within 60 days after the date the transferee acquires title to the
declarant's ownership interest, provides for the transfer of fewer than all of the declarant's special
declarant rights. From and after the effective date of this section, a separate instrument recorded
pursuant to subsection (b), item (iii), shall be recorded against title to all units in the common
interest community. For purposes of this subsection, the transferee shall be deemed to acquire title
upon the expiration of the owner's period of redemption, or reinstatement in the case of contract
for deed. The transferor shall cease to have and shall not exercise any special declarant right
that relates to the transferor's ownership interest in the units or additional real estate transferred,
whether or not the transferee subsequently disclaims the right, but the transferor retains all reserved
special declarant rights that relate to its ownership interest that is not transferred to the transferee.
    (c) If a declarant is an individual rather than a legal entity, and the individual dies, than all special
declarant rights that are reserved to the declarant in the declaration and that relate to the units or
additional real estate owned by the declarant are automatically transferred with the title to said units
or additional real estate.
    (d) A transferor's liability for the performance of obligations that this chapter imposes upon a

declarant is as follows:
    (1) A transferor remains liable under this chapter for all obligations that this chapter imposes
upon a declarant that arise on or before the effective date of the transfer, except that a transferor is not
liable under section 515B.4-112 for any express warranties that a transferee makes to a purchaser.
Except as set forth in subsection (d), clauses (2) and (3), a transferor is not liable under this chapter
for the performance of any obligations that this chapter imposes upon a declarant and arising after
the effective date of the transfer.
    (2) If a transferor and a transferee are affiliates, the transferor and the transferee are jointly and
severally liable under this chapter for the performance of all the obligations that this chapter imposes
upon a declarant, whether such obligations arise before, on, or after the effective date of the transfer.
Upon a subsequent transfer, a prior transferor remains liable to the extent its transferee remains liable
under subsection (d) and is relieved of liability to the same extent that its transferee is relieved of
liability under subsection (e).
    (3) If, following a transfer of special declarant rights, the transferor retains special declarant
rights, the transferor and transferee are jointly and severally liable for the performance of all the
obligations that this chapter imposes upon a declarant and that arise after the effective date of the
transfer, except that the transferor is not liable under section 515B.4-101(b) or 515B.4-102(b),
and section 515B.4-109, 515B.4-110, 515B.4-111, 515B.4-112, 515B.4-113, 515B.4-117, or
515B.4-118, to any purchaser from or through the transferee.
    (e) Except as provided in subsections (g) and (h), a transferee's liability for the performance of
obligations that this chapter imposes upon a declarant is as follows:
    (1) Except as set forth in subsection (e), clause (3), a transferee is liable under this chapter for
all obligations that this chapter imposes upon a declarant and that arise after the effective date of
the transfer. A transferee is not liable under this chapter for the performance of any obligations that
this chapter imposes upon a declarant and that arise before or on the effective date of the transfer,
except that a transferee is liable under section 515B.4-112 for any express warranties the transferee
makes to a purchaser before or on the effective date of the transfer.
    (2) If a transferor and a transferee are affiliates, the transferor and the transferee are jointly and
severally liable under this chapter for the performance of all the obligations that this chapter imposes
upon a declarant, whether such obligations arise before, on, or after the effective date of the transfer.
Upon a subsequent transfer, a prior transferor remains liable to the extent its transferee remains liable
under subsection (d) and is relieved of liability to the same extent that its transferee is relieved of
liability under this subsection.
    (3) If, following a transfer of special declarant rights under subsection (a) or (b), the transferor
retains special declarant rights, the transferor and transferee are jointly and severally liable for the
performance of all the obligations that this chapter imposes upon a declarant and that arise after the
effective date of the transfer, except that the transferee is not liable under section 515B.4-101(b)
or 515B.4-102(b), and section 515B.4-109, 515B.4-110, 515B.4-111, 515B.4-112, 515B.4-113,
515B.4-117, or 515B.4-118, to any purchaser from or through the transferor.
   (f) For purposes of this section, a declarant's obligations under section 515B.3-111(a) arise
when the tort or contract violation occurs, a declarant's obligations to a purchaser under section
515B.4-112 arise when the declarant makes an express warranty to the purchaser and a declarant's

obligations to a purchaser under sections 515B.4-113 and 515B.4-118(a) arise when the declarant
conveys a unit to the purchaser.
     (g) A transferee who acquires special declarant rights pursuant to subsection (b) and who is not an
affiliate of the transferor may record an instrument in compliance with subsection (b) stating that the
transferee elects to acquire only the special declarant rights described in section 515B.1-103(33b)(i),
(ii), and (iv). In that case, the transferee is liable as a declarant only to purchasers from said transferee
and only for the obligations of a declarant under sections 515B.4-101(b) and 515B.4-102(b), and
sections 515B.4-109, 515B.4-110, 515B.4-111, 515B.4-113, 515B.4-117, and 515B.4-118, and for
any express warranties under section 515B.4-112 that the transferee makes to purchasers.
    (h) A transferee who acquires special declarant rights pursuant to subsection (b) and who is not
an affiliate of the transferor may record an instrument in compliance with subsection (b) stating that
the transferee elects to acquire the special declarant rights solely for subsequent retransfer to another
person who acquires title to units or additional real estate from said transferee. In that case, (i) the
transferee may not utilize special declarant rights in the sale of units or otherwise sell units, except
to a person who also acquires one or more special declarant rights the transferee holds with respect
to the units or additional real estate sold; (ii) the transferee may not exercise any special declarant
rights other than the rights described in section 515B.1-103(33b)(v); (iii) the transferee is not liable
to make up any operating deficit under section 515B.3-115(a)(2); and (iv) the transferee is liable
as a declarant only for the obligations of a declarant under sections 515B.3-103, 515B.3-111, and
515B.3-120, as applicable. A transferee who makes the election described in this subsection may
subsequently rescind the election in whole or in part by recording an instrument in compliance with
applicable law, and upon the recording of such an instrument the transferee's rights and obligations
as a declarant shall be as otherwise set forth in this section.
   (i) Nothing in this section shall subject any transferee of a special declarant right to any claims
against or other obligations of a transferor, other than claims and obligations arising under this
chapter, or the declaration or bylaws.
    (j) A special declarant right held by a declarant terminates upon the earlier of: (i) that declarant's
voluntary surrender of the special declarant right by giving written notice to the unit owners pursuant
to section 515B.1-115; or (ii) the conveyance, whether voluntary or involuntary, by that declarant,
of all of the units and additional real estate owned by that declarant, unless immediately after the
conveyance the special declarant right is transferred to the grantee. All special declarant rights
terminate ten years after the date of the first conveyance of a unit to a person other than a declarant
unless extended by the vote or written agreement of unit owners entitled to cast at least 67 percent
of the votes allocated to units not owned by a declarant.
    (k) No person shall exercise special declarant rights unless, at the time of exercise, the person
holds title of record to one or more units or additional real estate. Any exercise of a special declarant
right in violation of this section shall be void, and the person attempting to exercise the right shall
be liable for all damages and costs arising from its actions.
    (l) Subsections (a) through (i) apply only to transfers of special declarant rights that are effective
on or after August 1, 2010. Subsections (j) and (k) apply only to special declarant rights reserved in
a declaration that is first recorded on or after August 1, 2010.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

    (a) The annual budgets of the association shall provide from year to year, on a cumulative
basis, for adequate reserve funds to cover the replacement of those parts of the common interest
community which the association is obligated to replace. These reserve requirements shall not apply
to a common interest community which is restricted to nonresidential use.
    (b) Unless the declaration provides otherwise, any surplus funds that the association has
remaining after payment of or provision for common expenses and reserves shall be (i) credited to
the unit owners to reduce their future common expense assessments or (ii) credited to reserves, or
any combination thereof, as determined by the board of directors.
   (c) This section applies to common interest communities only for their fiscal years commencing
before January 1, 2012.
       EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
       Sec. 15. [515B.3-1141] REPLACEMENT RESERVES.
    (a) The association shall include in its annual budgets replacement reserves projected by the
board to be adequate, together with past and future contributions to replacement reserves, to fund
the replacement of those components of the common interest community which the association is
obligated to replace by reason of ordinary wear and tear or obsolescence, subject to the following:
    (1) The amount annually budgeted for replacement reserves shall be adequate, together with past
and future contributions to replacement reserves, to replace the components as determined based
upon the estimated remaining useful life of each component; provided that portions of replacement
reserves need not be segregated for the replacement of specific components.
64TH DAY]                                                      MONDAY, MAY 23, 2011                                                                                   3557

    (2) Unless otherwise required by the declaration, annual budgets need not include reserves for the
replacement of (i) components that a remaining useful life of more than 30 years, or (ii) components
whose replacement will be funded by assessments authorized under section 515B.3-1151(e)(1), or
approved in compliance with clause (5).
    (3) The association shall keep the replacement reserves in an account or accounts separate from
the association's operating funds, and shall not use or borrow from the replacement reserves to fund
the association's operating expenses, provided that this restriction shall not affect the association's
authority to pledge the replacement reserves as security for a loan to the association.
   (4) The association shall reevaluate the adequacy of its budgeted replacement reserves at least
every third year after the recording of the declaration creating the common interest community.
    (5) Unless otherwise required by the declaration, after the termination of the period of declarant
control, and subject to approval by (i) the board, and (ii) unit owners, other than the declarant or its
affiliates, of units to which 51 percent of the votes in the association are allocated, the association
need not annually assess for replacement reserves to replace those components whose replacement
is planned to be paid for by special assessments, if the declaration authorizes special assessments, or
by assessments levied under section 515B.3-1151(e)(2). The approval provided for in the preceding
sentence shall be effective for no more than the association's current and three following fiscal years,
subject to modification or renewal by the same approval standards.
    (6) Unless otherwise required by the declaration, subsection (a) shall not apply to a common
interest community which is restricted to nonresidential use.
    (b) Unless the declaration provides otherwise, any surplus funds that the association has
remaining after payment of or provision for common expenses and reserves shall be (i) credited to
the unit owners to reduce their future common expense assessments or (ii) credited to reserves, or
any combination thereof, as determined by the board of directors.
   (c) This section applies to common interest communities only for their fiscal years commencing

   (d) Except as modified by subsections (a)(1) and (2), (e), (f), and (g), all common expenses shall
be assessed against all the units in accordance with the allocations established by the declaration
pursuant to section 515B.2-108.
   (e) Unless otherwise required by the declaration:
    (1) any common expense associated with the maintenance, repair, or replacement of a limited
common element shall be assessed against the units to which that limited common element is
assigned, equally, or in any other proportion the declaration provides;
   (2) any common expense or portion thereof benefiting fewer than all of the units may be assessed
exclusively against the units benefited, equally, or in any other proportion the declaration provides;
    (3) the costs of insurance may be assessed in proportion to risk or coverage, and the costs of
utilities may be assessed in proportion to usage;
    (4) reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred by the association in connection with (i) the
collection of assessments and, (ii) the enforcement of this chapter, the articles, bylaws, declaration,
or rules and regulations, against a unit owner, may be assessed against the unit owner's unit; and
   (5) fees, charges, late charges, fines and interest may be assessed as provided in section
515B.3-116(a).
    (f) Assessments levied under section 515B.3-116 to pay a judgment against the association may
be levied only against the units in the common interest community at the time the judgment was
entered, in proportion to their common expense liabilities.
    (g) If any damage to the common elements or another unit is caused by the act or omission of any
unit owner, or occupant of a unit, or their invitees, the association may assess the costs of repairing
the damage exclusively against the unit owner's unit to the extent not covered by insurance.
    (h) Subject to any shorter period specified by the declaration or bylaws, if any installment of an
assessment becomes more than 60 days past due, then the association may, upon ten days' written
notice to the unit owner, declare the entire amount of the assessment immediately due and payable
in full.

   Sec. 17. [515B.3-1151] ASSESSMENTS FOR COMMON EXPENSES.
    (a) The association shall approve an annual budget of common expenses at or prior to the
conveyance of the first unit in the common interest community to a purchaser and annually
thereafter. The annual budget shall include all customary and necessary operating expenses and
64TH DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 23, 2011                                          3561

replacement reserves for the common interest community, consistent with this section and section
515B.3-114. For purposes of replacement reserves under subsection (b), until an annual budget
has been approved, the reserves shall be paid based upon the budget contained in the disclosure
statement required by section 515B.4-102. The obligation of a unit owner to pay common expenses
shall be as follows:
    (1) If a common expense assessment has not been levied by the association, the declarant
shall pay all common expenses of the common interest community, including the payment of
the replacement reserve component of the common expenses for all units in compliance with
subsection (b).
    (2) If a common expense assessment has been levied by the association, all unit owners,
including the declarant, shall pay the assessments levied against their units, except as follows:
    (i) The declaration may provide for an alternate common expense plan whereby the declarant's
common expense liability, and the corresponding assessment lien against the units owned by the
declarant, is limited to: (A) paying when due, in compliance with subsection (b), an amount equal
to the full share of the replacement reserves allocated to units owned by the declarant, as set forth
in the association's annual budget approved as provided in this subsection; and (B) paying when
due all accrued expenses of the common interest community in excess of the aggregate assessments
payable with respect to units owned by persons other than a declarant; provided, that the alternate
common expense plan shall not affect a declarant's obligation to make up any operating deficit
pursuant to item (iv), and shall terminate upon the termination of any period of declarant control
unless terminated earlier pursuant to item (iii).
    (ii) The alternate common expense plan may be authorized only by including in the declaration
and the disclosure statement required by section 515B.4-102 provisions authorizing and disclosing
the alternate common expense plan as described in item (i), and including in the disclosure statement
either (A) a statement that the alternate common expense plan will have no effect on the level of
services or amenities anticipated by the association's budget contained in the disclosure statement,
or (B) a statement describing how the services or amenities may be affected.
     (iii) A declarant shall give notice to the association of its intent to utilize the alternate common
expense plan and a commencement date after the date the notice is given. The alternate common
expense plan shall be valid only for periods after the notice is given. A declarant may terminate
its right to utilize the alternative common expense plan prior to the termination of the period of
declarant control only by giving notice to the association and the unit owners at least 30 days prior
to a selected termination date set forth in the notice.
    (iv) If a declarant utilizes an alternate common expense plan, that declarant shall cause to
be prepared and delivered to the association, at the declarant's expense, within 90 days after the
termination of the period of declarant control, an audited balance sheet and profit and loss statement
certified to the association and prepared by an accountant having the qualifications set forth in
section 515B.3-121(b). The audit shall be binding on the declarant and the association.
   (v) If the audited profit and loss statement shows an accumulated operating deficit, the declarant
shall be obligated to make up the deficit within 15 days after delivery of the audit to the association,
and the association shall have a claim against the declarant for an amount equal to the deficit until
paid. A declarant who does not utilize an alternate common expense plan is not liable to make up
any operating deficit. If more than one declarant utilizes an alternate common expense plan, all
3562                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [64TH DAY

declarants who utilize the plan are jointly and severally liable to the association for any operating
deficit.
    (vi) The existence and amount, if any, of the operating deficit shall be determined using the
accrual method of accounting applied as of the date of termination of the period of declarant
control, regardless of the accounting methodology previously used by the association to maintain
its accounts.
    (vii) Unless approved by a vote of the unit owners other than the declarant and its affiliates, the
operating deficit shall not be made up, prior to the election by the unit owners of a board of directors
pursuant to section 515B.3-103(d), through the use of a special assessment described in subsection
(c) or by assessments described in subsections (e), (f), and (g).
    (viii) The use by a declarant of an alternate common expense plan shall not affect the obligations
of the declarant or the association as provided in the declaration, the bylaws, or this chapter, or
as represented in the disclosure statement required by section 515B.4-102, except as to matters
authorized by this chapter.
     (b) The replacement reserves required by section 515B.3-114 shall be paid to the association
by each unit owner for each unit owned by that unit owner in accordance with the association's
annual budget approved pursuant to subsection (a), regardless of whether an annual assessment has
been levied or whether the declarant has utilized an alternate common expense plan under subsection
(a)(2). Replacement reserves shall be paid with respect to a unit commencing as of the later of (1) the
date of creation of the common interest community or (2) the date that the structure and exterior of
the building containing the unit, or the structure and exterior of any building located within the unit
boundaries, but excluding the interior finishing of the structure itself, are substantially completed.
If the association has not approved an annual budget as of the commencement date for the payment
of replacement reserves, then the reserves shall be paid based upon the budget contained in the
disclosure statement required by section 515B.4-102.
    (c) After an assessment has been levied by the association, assessments shall be levied at least
annually, based upon an annual budget approved by the association. In addition to and not in lieu of
annual assessments, an association may, if so provided in the declaration, levy special assessments
against all units in the common interest community based upon the same formula required by the
declaration for levying annual assessments. Special assessments may be levied only (1) to cover
expenditures of an emergency nature, (2) to replenish underfunded replacement reserves, (3) to
cover unbudgeted capital expenditures or operating expenses, or (4) to replace certain components
of the common interest community described in section 515B.3-114(a), if such alternative method
of funding is approved under section 515B.3-114(a)(5). The association may also levy assessments
against fewer than all units as provided in subsections (e), (f), and (g). An assessment under
section 515B.3-1151(e)(2) for replacement reserves is subject to the requirements of section
515B.3-1141(a)(5).
   (d) Except as modified by subsections (a), clauses (1) and (2), (e), (f), and (g), all common
expenses shall be assessed against all the units in accordance with the allocations established by the
declaration pursuant to section 515B.2-108.
   (e) Unless otherwise required by the declaration:
   (1) any common expense associated with the maintenance, repair, or replacement of a limited
64TH DAY]                                                MONDAY, MAY 23, 2011                                                                         3563

common element shall be assessed against the units to which that limited common element is
assigned, equally, or in any other proportion the declaration provides;
   (2) any common expense or portion thereof benefiting fewer than all of the units may be assessed
exclusively against the units benefited, equally, or in any other proportion the declaration provides;
    (3) the costs of insurance may be assessed in proportion to risk or coverage, and the costs of
utilities may be assessed in proportion to usage;
    (4) reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred by the association in connection with (i) the
collection of assessments, and (ii) the enforcement of this chapter, the articles, bylaws, declaration,
or rules and regulations, against a unit owner, may be assessed against the unit owner's unit; and
   (5) fees, charges, late charges, fines, and interest may be assessed as provided in section
515B.3-116(a).
    (f) Assessments levied under section 515B.3-116 to pay a judgment against the association may
be levied only against the units in the common interest community at the time the judgment was
entered, in proportion to their common expense liabilities.
    (g) If any damage to the common elements or another unit is caused by the act or omission of any
unit owner, or occupant of a unit, or their invitees, the association may assess the costs of repairing
the damage exclusively against the unit owner's unit to the extent not covered by insurance.
    (h) Subject to any shorter period specified by the declaration or bylaws, if any installment of an
assessment becomes more than 60 days past due, then the association may, upon ten days' written
notice to the unit owner, declare the entire amount of the assessment immediately due and payable
in full.
   (i) If common expense liabilities are reallocated for any purpose authorized by this chapter,
common expense assessments and any installment thereof not yet due shall be recalculated in
accordance with the reallocated common expense liabilities.
   (j) An assessment against fewer than all of the units must be levied within three years after the
event or circumstances forming the basis for the assessment, or shall be barred.
