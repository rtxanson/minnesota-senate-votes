the presence of or to treat pregnancy and associated conditions, including contraception, abortion,
and venereal disease, or to treat alcohol and other drug abuse.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a minor may give effective consent and the consent of no
other person is required, if the minor declares that the minor is a victim of physical abuse, sexual
abuse, or incest perpetrated by the minor's parent or legal guardian and a court under subdivision
4 determines that the abuse or incest occurred and that having the services performed is in the best
interests of the minor. If this occurs, the minor's parents or legal guardian must not have access to the

    (c) A minor may participate in proceedings in the court on the minor's own behalf, and the court
may appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor. The court shall advise the minor that the minor has
a right to court appointed counsel and shall, upon request, appoint counsel.
    (d) Proceedings in the court under this section are confidential and must be given precedence
over other pending matters so that the court may reach a decision promptly and without delay so
as to serve the best interests of the minor. A judge who conducts proceedings under this section
shall make specific written factual findings and conclusions supporting the decision and shall order
a record of the evidence to be maintained, including the judge's own findings and conclusions.

days of receiving the state court administrator's determination, the commissioner shall reimburse
the administrator for the expenses.

grounds for a civil action by a parent wrongfully denied the opportunity to give effective consent
on behalf of the minor. A person is not liable under this section if the person establishes by written
evidence that the person relied upon evidence sufficient to convince a careful and prudent person
that the representations of the minor regarding information necessary to comply with this section
are bona fide and true.
    Subd. 7. Severability. If any provision, word, phrase or clause of this section or its application
to any person or circumstance is held invalid, this invalidity does not affect the provisions, words,
phrases, clauses, or application of this section that can be given effect without the invalid provision,
word, phrase, clause, or application, and to this end the provisions, words, phrases, and clauses of
this section are declared to be severable.

    (a) "Tip or gratuity" means a sum presented by a customer in recognition of a service performed.
It does not include:
     (1) payment of a charge made for a service;
    (2) any amount turned over to or credited to the employer to be treated by the employer as part
of the employer's gross receipts; or
    (3) a compulsory charge for service, including a fixed percentage of the total amount of the
bill, imposed on a customer unless the total amount of the compulsory charge is distributed by the
employer to the employee.
    (b) When tips or gratuities are received by the employee, the employer may pay an amount less
than the applicable minimum wage under subdivision 1, only if the employer can establish by its
payroll records that for each payroll period during which the employer pays an employee an amount
less than the minimum wage, that after adding the tips received to the wages paid, no less than the
minimum wage under subdivision 1 was received by the employee. However, in no case can an
employer pay less than 50 percent of the applicable minimum wage under subdivision 1.
    (c) When an employer pays an amount under paragraph (b) that is less than the minimum wage,
the employer must:
     (1) have a tip declaration signed by the employee each pay period; and
   (2) show on the payroll records that required Social Security or other taxes have been withheld
each pay period which demonstrate that when adding tips received to the wages paid by the
employer, an amount no less than the minimum wage under subdivision 1 was received by the
employee.
   If the employer's payroll records do not contain the required information, the employer shall not
pay an amount less than the minimum wage.
    (d) Under a pooling arrangement whereby the employer redistributes tips to employees based
upon a system developed by and to which the employees have mutually agreed among themselves,
only the amounts received and retained by each individual employee are counted as the employee's
tips.
    (e) This subdivision applies only when an employee receives tips or gratuities in excess of $50
per month."

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.056, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Income and assets generally. Unless specifically required by state law or rule or
federal law or regulation, the methodologies used in counting income and assets to determine
eligibility for medical assistance for persons whose eligibility category is based on blindness,
disability, or age of 65 or more years, the methodologies for the supplemental security income
program shall be used, except as provided under subdivision 3, clause (6). Increases in benefits
under title II of the Social Security Act shall not be counted as income for purposes of this
subdivision until July 1 of each year. Effective upon federal approval, for children eligible under
section 256B.055, subdivision 12, or for home and community-based waiver services whose
eligibility for medical assistance is determined without regard to parental income, child support
payments, including any payments made by an obligor in satisfaction of or in addition to a
temporary or permanent order for child support, and Social Security payments are not counted as
income. For families and children, which includes all other eligibility categories, the methodologies
under the state's AFDC plan in effect as of July 16, 1996, as required by the Personal Responsibility
and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), Public Law 104-193, shall be used,
except that effective October 1, 2003, the earned income disregards and deductions are limited to
those in subdivision 1c. For these purposes, a "methodology" does not include an asset or income
standard, or accounting method, or method of determining effective dates.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.056, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Asset limitations for individuals and families. (a) To be eligible for medical
assistance, a person must not individually own more than $3,000 in assets, or if a member of a
household with two family members, husband and wife, or parent and child, the household must
not own more than $6,000 in assets, plus $200 for each additional legal dependent. In addition to
these maximum amounts, an eligible individual or family may accrue interest on these amounts,
but they must be reduced to the maximum at the time of an eligibility redetermination. The

accumulation of the clothing and personal needs allowance according to section 256B.35 must
also be reduced to the maximum at the time of the eligibility redetermination. The value of assets
that are not considered in determining eligibility for medical assistance is the value of those assets
excluded under the supplemental security income program for aged, blind, and disabled persons,
with the following exceptions:
   (1) household goods and personal effects are not considered;
   (2) capital and operating assets of a trade or business that the local agency determines are
necessary to the person's ability to earn an income are not considered;
   (3) motor vehicles are excluded to the same extent excluded by the supplemental security income
program;
    (4) assets designated as burial expenses are excluded to the same extent excluded by the
supplemental security income program. Burial expenses funded by annuity contracts or life
insurance policies must irrevocably designate the individual's estate as contingent beneficiary to
the extent proceeds are not used for payment of selected burial expenses; ­

    ­­) (4) Increases in benefits under title II of the Social Security Act shall not be counted as
income for purposes of this subdivision until July 1 of each year.
  (f) A person's eligibility and premium shall be determined by the local county agency. Premiums
must be paid to the commissioner. All premiums are dedicated to the commissioner.
    (g) Any required premium shall be determined at application and redetermined at the enrollee's
six-month income review or when a change in income or household size is reported. Enrollees
must report any change in income or household size within ten days of when the change occurs. A
decreased premium resulting from a reported change in income or household size shall be effective
the first day of the next available billing month after the change is reported. Except for changes
occurring from annual cost-of-living increases, a change resulting in an increased premium shall
not affect the premium amount until the next six-month review.
   (h) Premium payment is due upon notification from the commissioner of the premium amount
required. Premiums may be paid in installments at the discretion of the commissioner.
    (i) Nonpayment of the premium shall result in denial or termination of medical assistance
unless the person demonstrates good cause for nonpayment. Good cause exists if the requirements
specified in Minnesota Rules, part 9506.0040, subpart 7, items B to D, are met. Except when an
installment agreement is accepted by the commissioner, all persons disenrolled for nonpayment
of a premium must pay any past due premiums as well as current premiums due prior to being
reenrolled. Nonpayment shall include payment with a returned, refused, or dishonored instrument.
The commissioner may require a guaranteed form of payment as the only means to replace a
returned, refused, or dishonored instrument.
    (j) The commissioner shall notify enrollees annually beginning at least 24 months before the
person's 65th birthday of the medical assistance eligibility rules affecting income, assets, and
treatment of a spouse's income and assets that will be applied upon reaching age 65.
    (k) For enrollees whose income does not exceed 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines
and who are also enrolled in Medicare, the commissioner must reimburse the enrollee for Medicare
part B premiums under section 256B.0625, subdivision 15, paragraph (a).

or responsible parties must be able to identify the recipient's needs, direct and evaluate task
accomplishment, and provide for health and safety. Approved hours may be used outside the home
when normal life activities take them outside the home. To use personal care assistance services
at school, the recipient or responsible party must provide written authorization in the care plan
identifying the chosen provider and the daily amount of services to be used at school. Total hours
for services, whether actually performed inside or outside the recipient's home, cannot exceed that
which is otherwise allowed for personal care assistance services in an in-home setting according
to sections 256B.0651 to 256B.0656. Medical assistance does not cover personal care assistance
services for residents of a hospital, nursing facility, intermediate care facility, health care facility
licensed by the commissioner of health, or unless a resident who is otherwise eligible is on leave
from the facility and the facility either pays for the personal care assistance services or forgoes the
facility per diem for the leave days that personal care assistance services are used. All personal
care assistance services must be provided according to sections 256B.0651 to 256B.0656. Personal
care assistance services may not be reimbursed if the personal care assistant is the spouse or paid
guardian of the recipient or the parent of a recipient under age 18, or the responsible party or the
family foster care provider of a recipient who cannot direct the recipient's own care unless, in the
case of a foster care provider, a county or state case manager visits the recipient as needed, but
not less than every six months, to monitor the health and safety of the recipient and to ensure
the goals of the care plan are met. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 256B.0659, the
unpaid guardian or conservator of an adult, who is not the responsible party and not the personal
care provider organization, may be reimbursed to provide personal care assistance services to the
recipient if the guardian or conservator meets all criteria for a personal care assistant according to
section 256B.0659, and shall not be considered to have a service provider interest for purposes of
participation on the screening team under section 256B.092, subdivision 7.
     Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0652, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Authorization; personal care assistance and qualified professional. (a) All personal
care assistance services, supervision by a qualified professional, and additional services beyond the
limits established in subdivision 11, must be authorized by the commissioner or the commissioner's
designee before services begin except for the assessments established in subdivision 11 and section
256B.0911. The authorization for personal care assistance and qualified professional services under
section 256B.0659 must be completed within 30 days after receiving a complete request.
    (b) The amount of personal care assistance services authorized must be based on the
recipient's home care rating. The home care rating shall be determined by the commissioner or
the commissioner's designee based on information submitted to the commissioner identifying the
following for recipients with dependencies in two or more activities of daily living:
     (1) total number of dependencies of activities of daily living as defined in section 256B.0659;
     (2) presence of complex health-related needs as defined in section 256B.0659; and
     (3) presence of Level I behavior as defined in section 256B.0659.

    (c) For persons meeting the criteria in paragraph (b), the methodology to determine total time
for personal care assistance services for each home care rating is based on the median paid units per
day for each home care rating from fiscal year 2007 data for the personal care assistance program.
Each home care rating has a base level of hours assigned. Additional time is added through the
assessment and identification of the following:
    (1) 30 additional minutes per day for a dependency in each critical activity of daily living as
defined in section 256B.0659;
   (2) 30 additional minutes per day for each complex health-related function as defined in section
256B.0659; and
   (3) 30 additional minutes per day for each behavior issue as defined in section 256B.0659,
subdivision 4, paragraph (d).
    (d) Effective July 1, 2011, the home care rating for recipients who have a dependency in one
activity of daily living or level one behavior shall equal no more than two units per day.
    (e) A limit of 96 units of qualified professional supervision may be authorized for each recipient
receiving personal care assistance services. A request to the commissioner to exceed this total in a
calendar year must be requested by the personal care provider agency on a form approved by the
commissioner.
    Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0913, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Eligibility for funding for services for nonmedical assistance recipients. (a) Funding
for services under the alternative care program is available to persons who meet the following
criteria:
    (1) the person has been determined by a community assessment under section 256B.0911 to be a
person who would require the level of care provided in a nursing facility, as determined under section
256B.0911, subdivision 4a, paragraph (d), but for the provision of services under the alternative
care program.  ­ ­­

shall be applied to all other participants who meet this criteria at reassessment. This monthly limit
shall be increased annually as described in section 256B.0915, subdivision 3a, paragraph (a). This
monthly limit does not prohibit the alternative care client from payment for additional services,
but in no case may the cost of additional services purchased exceed the difference between the
client's monthly service limit defined in this clause and the limit described in clause (6) for case mix
classification A; and
     (8) the person is making timely payments of the assessed monthly fee.
A person is ineligible if payment of the fee is over 60 days past due, unless the person agrees to:
     (i) the appointment of a representative payee;
     (ii) automatic payment from a financial account;
     (iii) the establishment of greater family involvement in the financial management of payments;
or
     (iv) another method acceptable to the lead agency to ensure prompt fee payments.
    The lead agency may extend the client's eligibility as necessary while making arrangements to
facilitate payment of past-due amounts and future premium payments. Following disenrollment due
to nonpayment of a monthly fee, eligibility shall not be reinstated for a period of 30 days.
    (b) Alternative care funding under this subdivision is not available for a person who is a medical
assistance recipient or who would be eligible for medical assistance without a spenddown or waiver
obligation. A person whose initial application for medical assistance and the elderly waiver program
is being processed may be served under the alternative care program for a period up to 60 days. If
the individual is found to be eligible for medical assistance, medical assistance must be billed for
services payable under the federally approved elderly waiver plan and delivered from the date the
individual was found eligible for the federally approved elderly waiver plan. Notwithstanding this
provision, alternative care funds may not be used to pay for any service the cost of which: (i) is

     Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0915, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3a. Elderly waiver cost limits. (a) The monthly limit for the cost of waivered services
to an individual elderly waiver client except for individuals described in paragraph (b) shall be the
weighted average monthly nursing facility rate of the case mix resident class to which the elderly
waiver client would be assigned under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, less the
recipient's maintenance needs allowance as described in subdivision 1d, paragraph (a), until the
first day of the state fiscal year in which the resident assessment system as described in section
256B.438 for nursing home rate determination is implemented. Effective on the first day of the state
fiscal year in which the resident assessment system as described in section 256B.438 for nursing
home rate determination is implemented and the first day of each subsequent state fiscal year, the
monthly limit for the cost of waivered services to an individual elderly waiver client shall be the rate
of the case mix resident class to which the waiver client would be assigned under Minnesota Rules,
parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, in effect on the last day of the previous state fiscal year, adjusted

a person who is a nursing facility resident at the time of requesting a determination of eligibility
for elderly waivered services, a monthly conversion budget limit for the cost of elderly waivered
services may be requested. The monthly conversion budget limit for the cost of elderly waiver
services shall be the resident class assigned under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059,

resident assessment system as described in section 256B.438 for nursing home rate determination
is implemented, the monthly conversion budget limit for the cost of elderly waiver services shall
be based on the per diem nursing facility rate as determined by the resident assessment system as

monthly nursing facility rate of the case mix resident class to which the elderly waiver eligible client
would be assigned under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, less the maintenance
needs allowance as described in subdivision 1d, paragraph (a), until the July 1 of the state fiscal
year in which the resident assessment system as described in section 256B.438 for nursing home
rate determination is implemented. Effective on July 1 of the state fiscal year in which the resident
assessment system as described in section 256B.438 for nursing home rate determination is
implemented and July 1 of each subsequent state fiscal year, the individualized monthly authorized
payment for the services described in this clause shall not exceed the limit which was in effect on

256B.0651, subdivision 14.
    (g) A provider may not bill or otherwise charge an elderly waiver participant or their family
for additional units of any allowable component service beyond those available under the service
rate limits described in paragraph (d), nor for additional units of any allowable component service
beyond those approved in the service plan by the lead agency.

established by the commissioner for all component customized living services authorized. The lead
agency shall not authorize 24-hour customized living services unless there is a documented need
for 24-hour supervision.

Counties and tribes will use tools issued by the commissioner to develop and document customized
living plans and authorize rates.
  (d) Component service rates must not exceed payment rates for comparable elderly waiver or
medical assistance services and must reflect economies of scale.
    (e) The individually authorized 24-hour customized living payments, in combination with

mix resident class under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, to which elderly waiver
service clients are assigned. When there are fewer than 50 authorizations in effect in the case mix
resident class, the commissioner shall multiply the calculated service payment rate maximum for
the A classification by the standard weight for that classification under Minnesota Rules, parts
9549.0050 to 9549.0059, to determine the applicable payment rate maximum. Service payment
rate maximums shall be updated annually based on legislatively adopted changes to all service
rates for home and community-based service providers.
    (g) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (f), the commissioner may establish
alternative payment rate systems for 24-hour customized living services in housing with services
establishments which are freestanding buildings with a capacity of 16 or fewer, by applying a single

    (c) For a community spouse with an income equal to or greater than 250 percent of the federal
poverty guidelines for a family of two and less than 545 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for
a family of two, the spousal contribution shall be determined using a sliding fee scale established by
the commissioner that begins at 7.5 percent of the community spouse's income and increases to 15
percent for those with an income of up to 545 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for a family
of two.
    (d) For a community spouse with an income equal to or greater than 545 percent of the federal
poverty guidelines for a family of two and less than 750 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for
a family of two, the spousal contribution shall be determined using a sliding fee scale established by
the commissioner that begins at 15 percent of the community spouse's income and increases to 25
percent for those with an income of up to 750 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for a family
of two.
    (e) For a community spouse with an income equal to or greater than 750 percent of the federal
poverty guidelines for a family of two and less than 975 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for
a family of two, the spousal contribution shall be determined using a sliding fee scale established by
the commissioner that begins at 25 percent of the community spouse's income and increases to 33
percent for those with an income of up to 975 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for a family
of two.
   (f) For a community spouse with an income equal to or greater than 975 percent of the federal
poverty guidelines for a family of two, the spousal contribution shall be 33 percent of the community
spouse's income.
    (g) The spousal contribution shall be explained in writing at the time eligibility for medical
assistance or alternative care is being determined. In addition to explaining the formula used to
determine the fee, the commissioner shall provide written information describing how to request
a variance for undue hardship, how a contribution may be reviewed or redetermined, the right to
appeal a contribution determination, and that the consequences for not complying with a request to
provide information shall be an assessment against the community spouse for the full cost of care
for the long-term care spouse.
  (h) The contribution shall be assessed for each month the long-term care spouse is eligible for
medical assistance or alternative care.

    (i) The spousal contribution shall be reviewed at least once every 12 months and when there is
a loss or gain in income in excess of ten percent. Thirty days prior to a review or redetermination,
written notice must be provided to the community spouse and must contain the amount the spouse is
required to contribute, notice of the right to redetermination and appeal, and the telephone number of
the division at the department that is responsible for redetermination and review. If, after review, the
contribution amount is to be adjusted, the commissioner shall mail a written notice to the community
spouse 30 days in advance of the effective date of the change in the amount of the contribution:
   (1) the spouse shall notify the commissioner within 30 days of a gain or loss in income in
excess of ten percent and provide the department supporting documentation to verify the need for
redetermination of the fee;
    (2) when a spouse requests a review or redetermination of the contribution amount, a request for
information shall be sent to the spouse within ten calendar days after the commissioner receives the
request for review;
    (3) no action shall be taken on a review or redetermination until the required information is
received by the commissioner;
    (4) the review of the spousal contribution shall be done within ten days after the commissioner
receives completed information that verifies a loss or gain in income in excess of ten percent;
   (5) an increase in the contribution amount is effective in the month in the increase in spousal
income occurs; and
   (6) a decrease in the contribution amount is effective in the month the spouse verifies the
reduction in income, retroactive to no longer than six months.
    (j) In no case shall the spousal contribution exceed the amount of medical assistance expended
or the cost of alternative care services for the care of the long-term care spouse. At the time of the
review, the total amount of medical assistance paid or costs of alternative care for the care of the
long-term care spouse and the total amount of the spousal contribution shall be compared. If the total
amount of the spousal contribution exceeds the total amount of medical assistance expended or cost
of alternative care, the department shall reimburse the community spouse the excess amount if the
long-term care spouse is no longer receiving services, or apply the excess amount to the spousal
contribution due until the excess amount is exhausted.
    (k) A spouse who needs to retain the contribution amount for the spouse's personal medical
care may request a variance for undue hardship by submitting a written request and supporting
documentation to the commissioner that states why compliance with this subdivision would cause
undue hardship. The commissioner shall forward to the spouse a request for financial information
within ten days after receiving a written request for a variance. A spouse must provide the
commissioner with the requested financial information and any other information sufficient to
verify the existence of undue hardship necessitating a waiver:
    (1) a spouse who requests a variance from a notice of an increase in the amount of spousal
contribution shall continue to make monthly payments at the lower amount pending determination
of the variance request. A spouse who requests a variance from the initial determination shall not be
required to make a payment pending determination of the variance request. Payments made pending
outcome of the variance request that result in overpayment shall be returned to the spouse if the

community spouse is no longer receiving services or applied to the spousal contribution in the
current year. If the variance is denied, the spouse shall pay the additional amount due from the
effective date of the increase or the total amount due from the effective date of the original notice
of determination of the spousal contribution;
    (2) a spouse who is granted a variance shall sign a written agreement in which the spouse agrees
to report to the commissioner any changes in circumstances that gave rise to the undue hardship
variance;
     (3) when the commissioner receives a request for a variance, written notice of a grant or denial of
the variance shall be mailed to the spouse within 30 calendar days after the commissioner receives
the financial information required in this paragraph. The granting of a variance will necessitate a
written agreement between the spouse and the commissioner with regard to the specific terms of the
variance. The variance will not become effective until the written agreement is signed by the spouse.
If the commissioner denies in whole or in part the request for a variance, the denial notice shall set
forth in writing the reasons for the denial that address the specific hardship and right to appeal;
    (4) if a variance is granted, the term of the variance shall not exceed 12 months unless otherwise
determined by the commissioner; and
    (5) undue hardship does not include action taken by a spouse that divested or diverted income
in order to avoid being assessed a spousal contribution.
    (l) A spouse aggrieved by an action under this subdivision has the right to appeal under
subdivision 4. If the spouse appeals on or before the effective date of an increase in the spousal fee,
the spouse shall continue to make payments to the commissioner in the lower amount while the
appeal is pending. A spouse appealing an initial determination of a spousal contribution shall not be
required to make monthly payments pending an appeal decision. Payments made that result in an
overpayment shall be reimbursed to the spouse if the long-term care spouse is no longer receiving
services, or applied to the spousal contribution remaining in the current year. If the commissioner's
determination is affirmed, the community spouse shall pay within 90 calendar days of the order
the total amount due from the effective date of the original notice of determination of the spousal
contribution. The commissioner's order is binding on the spouse and the department and shall be
implemented subject to section 256.045, subdivision 7. No additional notice is required to enforce
the commissioner's order.
   (m) Actions to obtain payment shall be taken under subdivision 2.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.431, subdivision 2r, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2r. Payment restrictions on leave days. Effective July 1, 1993, the commissioner shall
limit payment for leave days in a nursing facility to 79 percent of that nursing facility's total payment
rate for the involved resident. For services rendered on or after July 1, 2003, for facilities reimbursed
under this section or section 256B.434, the commissioner shall limit payment for leave days in a
nursing facility to 60 percent of that nursing facility's total payment rate for the involved resident.
For services rendered on or after July 1, 2011, for facilities reimbursed under this section, section
256B.434, section 256B.441, or any other section, the commissioner shall not pay for leave days,
notwithstanding Minnesota Rules, part 9505.0415.

if a resident has resided during the previous 30 calendar days in:
     (1) the same nursing facility;
     (2) a nursing facility owned or operated by a related party; or
     (3) a nursing facility or part of a facility that closed or was in the process of closing.
     Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.431, subdivision 42, is amended to read:
    Subd. 42. Incentive to establish single-bed rooms. (a) Beginning July 1, 2005, the operating
payment rate for nursing facilities reimbursed under this section, section 256B.434, or 256B.441
shall be increased by 20 percent multiplied by the ratio of the number of new single-bed rooms
created divided by the number of active beds on July 1, 2005, for each bed closure that results
in the creation of a single-bed room after July 1, 2005. The commissioner may implement rate
adjustments for up to 3,000 new single-bed rooms each year. For eligible bed closures for which
the commissioner receives a notice from a facility during a calendar quarter that a bed has been
delicensed and a new single-bed room has been established, the rate adjustment in this paragraph
shall be effective on the first day of the second month following that calendar quarter.
    (b) A nursing facility is prohibited from discharging residents for purposes of establishing
single-bed rooms. A nursing facility must submit documentation to the commissioner in a form
prescribed by the commissioner, certifying the occupancy status of beds closed to create single-bed
rooms. In the event that the commissioner determines that a facility has discharged a resident for

purposes of establishing a single-bed room, the commissioner shall not provide a rate adjustment
under paragraph (a).
    (c) If after August 1, 2005, and before December 31, 2007, more than 4,000 nursing home beds
are removed from service, a portion of the appropriation for nursing homes shall be transferred to the
alternative care program. The amount of this transfer shall equal the number of beds removed from
service less 4,000, multiplied by the average monthly per-person cost for alternative care, multiplied
by 12, and further multiplied by 0.3.
    (d) Beginning on July 1, 2011, the commissioner shall no longer approve single bed incentive
rate adjustments under this section.
      Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.431, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 44. Property rate increase for a facility in Bloomington effective November 1, 2010.
Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, money available for moratorium projects under
section 144A.073, subdivision 11, shall be used effective November 1, 2010, to fund an approved
moratorium exception project for a nursing facility in Bloomington licensed for 137 beds as of
November 1, 2010, up to a total property rate adjustment of $19.33.
      Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.437, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Planned closure rate adjustment. (a) The commissioner of human services shall
calculate the amount of the planned closure rate adjustment available under subdivision 3, paragraph
(b), for up to 5,140 beds according to clauses (1) to (4):
      (1) the amount available is the net reduction of nursing facility beds multiplied by $2,080;
   (2) the total number of beds in the nursing facility or facilities receiving the planned closure rate
adjustment must be identified;
      (3) capacity days are determined by multiplying the number determined under clause (2) by 365;
and
   (4) the planned closure rate adjustment is the amount available in clause (1), divided by capacity
days determined under clause (3).
    (b) A planned closure rate adjustment under this section is effective on the first day of the month
following completion of closure of the facility designated for closure in the application and becomes
part of the nursing facility's total operating payment rate.
    (c) Applicants may use the planned closure rate adjustment to allow for a property payment for
a new nursing facility or an addition to an existing nursing facility or as an operating payment rate
adjustment. Applications approved under this subdivision are exempt from other requirements for
moratorium exceptions under section 144A.073, subdivisions 2 and 3.
   (d) Upon the request of a closing facility, the commissioner must allow the facility a closure rate
adjustment as provided under section 144A.161, subdivision 10.
    (e) A facility that has received a planned closure rate adjustment may reassign it to another
facility that is under the same ownership at any time within three years of its effective date. The
amount of the adjustment shall be computed according to paragraph (a).

    (f) If the per bed dollar amount specified in paragraph (a), clause (1), is increased, the
commissioner shall recalculate planned closure rate adjustments for facilities that delicense beds
under this section on or after July 1, 2001, to reflect the increase in the per bed dollar amount. The
recalculated planned closure rate adjustment shall be effective from the date the per bed dollar
amount is increased.
   (g) For planned closures approved after June 30, 2009, the commissioner of human services
shall calculate the amount of the planned closure rate adjustment available under subdivision 3,
paragraph (b), according to paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (4).
   (h) Beginning on July 1, 2011, the commissioner shall no longer approve planned closure rate
adjustments under this section.
   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.441, subdivision 50a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 50a. Determination of proximity adjustments. (a) For a nursing facility located in close
proximity to another nursing facility of the same facility group type but in a different peer group
and that has higher limits for care-related or other operating costs, the commissioner shall adjust the
limits in accordance with clauses (1) to (4):
   (1) determine the difference between the limits;
   (2) determine the distance between the two facilities, by the shortest driving route. If the distance
exceeds 20 miles, no adjustment shall be made;
   (3) subtract the value in clause (2) from 20 miles, divide by 20, and convert to a percentage; and
    (4) increase the limits for the nursing facility with the lower limits by the value determined in
clause (1) multiplied by the value determined in clause (3).
   (b) Effective October 1, 2011, nursing facilities located no more than one-quarter mile from
a peer group with higher limits under either subdivision 50 or 51, may receive an operating rate
adjustment. The operating payment rates of a lower-limit peer group facility must be adjusted to be
equal to those of the nearest facility in a higher-limit peer group if that facility's RUG rate with a
weight of 1.00 is higher than the lower-limit peer group facility. Peer groups are those defined in
subdivision 30. The nearest facility must be determined by the most direct driving route.
   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.441, subdivision 59, is amended to read:
    Subd. 59. Single-bed payments for medical assistance recipients. Effective October 1, 2009,

from 115 percent to 111.5 percent. Effective July 1, 2011, the amount paid for a private room under
Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0070, subpart 3, is reduced from 111.5 percent to 100.0 percent.

    (1) the nursing facility may ­ (1

room, and ­ (­
             2­) (ii) charge for special services which are not included in the daily rate if medical
assistance residents are charged separately at the same rate for the same services in addition to the
daily rate paid by the commissioner;
    (2) effective October 1, 2011, nursing facilities may charge private paying residents up to two
percent higher than the sum of the medical assistance allowable payment rate in effect on September
30, 2011, plus an adjustment equal to the incremental increase of any other rate increase provided
in law, for the RUGS group currently assigned to the resident;
    (3) effective October 1, 2012, nursing facilities may charge private paying residents rates up
to four percent higher than the sum of the medical assistance allowable payment rate in effect on
September 30, 2012, plus an adjustment equal to the incremental increase of any other rate increase
provided in law, for the RUGS group currently assigned to the resident;
    (4) effective October 1, 2013, nursing facilities may charge private paying residents rates up
to six percent higher than the sum of the medical assistance allowable payment rate in effect on
September 30, 2013, plus an adjustment equal to the incremental increase of any other rate increase
provided in law, for the RUGS group currently assigned to the resident; and
    (5) effective October 1, 2014, nursing facilities may charge private paying residents rates up
to eight percent higher than the sum of the medical assistance allowable payment rate in effect on
September 30, 2014, plus an adjustment equal to the incremental increase of any other rate increase
provided in law, for the RUGS group currently assigned to the resident. Nothing in this section
precludes a nursing facility from charging a rate allowable under the nursing facility's single room
election option under Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0060, subpart 11, or the enhanced rates under
section 256B.431, subdivision 32.
    Services covered by the payment rate must be the same regardless of payment source. Special
services, if offered, must be available to all residents in all areas of the nursing facility and charged
separately at the same rate. Residents are free to select or decline special services. Special services
must not include services which must be provided by the nursing facility in order to comply with
licensure or certification standards and that if not provided would result in a deficiency or violation
by the nursing facility. Services beyond those required to comply with licensure or certification
standards must not be charged separately as a special service if they were included in the payment
rate for the previous reporting year. A nursing facility that charges a private paying resident a

include services that must be provided by the nursing facility in order to comply with licensure or
certification standards and that, if not provided, would result in a deficiency or violation by the
nursing facility.
    (d) A nursing facility shall refrain from all of the following:
    (1) charging, soliciting, accepting, or receiving from an applicant for admission to the facility, or
from anyone acting in behalf of the applicant, as a condition of admission, expediting the admission,
or as a requirement for the individual's continued stay, any fee, deposit, gift, money, donation, or
other consideration not otherwise required as payment under the state plan. For residents on medical
assistance, payment of the medical assistance rate according to the state plan must be accepted as
payment in full for services included in the daily rate for continued stay, except where otherwise
provided for in statute;
    (2) requiring an individual, or anyone acting in behalf of the individual, to loan any money to
the nursing facility;
    (3) requiring an individual, or anyone acting in behalf of the individual, to promise to leave all
or part of the individual's estate to the facility; or
   (4) requiring a third-party guarantee of payment to the facility as a condition of admission,
expedited admission, or continued stay in the facility.
Nothing in this paragraph would prohibit discharge for nonpayment of services in accordance with
state and federal regulations.

20 days from its receipt of the order to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within
the 20-day period the commissioner may reduce the payment rate to the nursing facility by up to 20
percent. The amount of the payment rate reduction shall be related to the severity of the violation
and shall remain in effect until the violation is corrected. The nursing facility or boarding care

    (5) establish a process that provides public input from interested parties before special
transportation eligibility policies are implemented or significantly changed;
    (6) establish specific eligibility criteria that include the frequency of eligibility assessments and
the length of time a recipient remains eligible for special transportation; and
    (7) develop a reimbursement method to compensate volunteers for no-load miles when
transporting recipients to or from health-related appointments.
   (c) In developing the proposal, the commissioner shall consult with the Nonemergency Medical
Transportation Advisory Council established under paragraph (d).
    (d) The commissioner shall establish the Nonemergency Medical Transportation Advisory
Council to assist the commissioner in developing a single administrative structure for providing
nonemergency medical transportation services. The council shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
   (1) one representative each from the Departments of Human Services and Transportation;
   (2) one representative each from the following organizations: the Minnesota State Council
on Disability, the Minnesota Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, ARC of Minnesota,

all federal, state, and local child care funds must be paid directly to the child care provider, either
licensed or legal nonlicensed, on behalf of the eligible family. Funds distributed under this chapter

child's home if the child's parents have authorized activities outside of the home and if one or more
of the following circumstances are met:
    (1) the parents' qualifying activity occurs during times when out-of-home care is not available.
If child care is needed during any period when out-of-home care is not available, in-home care can
be approved for the entire time care is needed;
   (2) the family lives in an area where out-of-home care is not available; or
    (3) a child has a verified illness or disability that would place the child or other children in an
out-of-home facility at risk or creates a hardship for the child and the family to take the child out of
the home to a child care home or center.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective March 5, 2012.

      ) (b) Every year, the commissioner shall survey rates charged by child care providers in
Minnesota to determine the 75th percentile for like-care arrangements in counties. When the
commissioner determines that, using the commissioner's established protocol, the number of
providers responding to the survey is too small to determine the 75th percentile rate for like-care
arrangements in a county or multicounty region, the commissioner may establish the 75th
percentile maximum rate based on like-care arrangements in a county, region, or category that the
commissioner deems to be similar.

    (d
     ­­) (c) A rate which includes a special needs rate paid under subdivision 3 or under a school
readiness service agreement paid under section 119B.231, may be in excess of the maximum rate
allowed under this subdivision.

      ) (d) The department shall monitor the effect of this paragraph on provider rates. The county
shall pay the provider's full charges for every child in care up to the maximum established. The
commissioner shall determine the maximum rate for each type of care on an hourly, full-day, and
weekly basis, including special needs and disability care. The maximum payment to a provider for
one day of care must not exceed the daily rate. The maximum payment to a provider for one week
of care must not exceed the weekly rate.
32ND DAY]                                                     MONDAY, MARCH 28, 2011                                                                                         805

    (e) Child care providers receiving reimbursement under this chapter must not be paid activity
fees or an additional amount above the maximum rates for care provided during nonstandard hours
for families receiving assistance.
    (f) When the provider charge is greater than the maximum provider rate allowed, the parent is
responsible for payment of the difference in the rates in addition to any family co-payment fee.
    (g) All maximum provider rates changes shall be implemented on the Monday following the
effective date of the maximum provider rate.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. Paragraph (d) is effective April 16, 2012. Paragraph (e) is effective
September 3, 2012.
       Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 119B.13, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Legal nonlicensed family child care provider rates. (a) Legal nonlicensed family
child care providers receiving reimbursement under this chapter must be paid on an hourly basis for
care provided to families receiving assistance.
    (b) The maximum rate paid to legal nonlicensed family child care providers must be 80 percent
of the county maximum hourly rate for licensed family child care providers. In counties where the
maximum hourly rate for licensed family child care providers is higher than the maximum weekly
rate for those providers divided by 50, the maximum hourly rate that may be paid to legal nonlicensed
family child care providers is the rate equal to the maximum weekly rate for licensed family child
care providers divided by 50 and then multiplied by 0.80. The maximum payment to a provider for
one day of care must not exceed the maximum hourly rate times ten. The maximum payment to a
provider for one week of care must not exceed the maximum hourly rate times 50.

    (b) A prepaid health plan may provide in an alternative format a provider directory and
certificate of coverage, or materials otherwise required to be available in writing under Code of
Federal Regulations, title 42, section 438.10, or under the commissioner's contract with the prepaid
health plan, if the following conditions are met:
    (1) the prepaid health plan, local agency, or commissioner, as applicable, informs the enrollee
that:
   (i) an alternative format is available and the enrollee affirmatively requests of the prepaid health
plan that the provider directory, certificate of coverage, or materials otherwise required under Code
of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 438.10, or under the commissioner's contract with the
prepaid health plan be provided in an alternative format; and
    (ii) a record of the enrollee request is retained by the prepaid health plan in the form of written
direction from the enrollee or a documented telephone call followed by a confirmation letter to the
enrollee from the prepaid health plan that explains that the enrollee may change the request at any
time;
   (2) the materials are sent to a secure electronic mailbox and are made available at a
password-protected secure electronic Web site or on a data storage device if the materials contain
enrollee data that is individually identifiable;
  (3) the enrollee is provided a customer service number on the enrollee's membership card that
may be called to request a paper version of the materials provided in an alternative format; and
    (4) the materials provided in an alternative format meets all other requirements of the
commissioner regarding content, size of the typeface, and any required time frames for distribution.
"Required time frames for distribution" must permit sufficient time for prepaid health plans to
distribute materials in alternative formats upon receipt of enrollees' requests for the materials.
    (c) A prepaid health plan may provide in an alternative format its primary care network list to
the commissioner and to local agencies within its service area. The commissioner or local agency,

as applicable, shall inform a potential enrollee of the availability of a prepaid health plan's primary
care network list in an alternative format. If the potential enrollee requests an alternative format of
the prepaid health plan's primary care network list, a record of that request shall be retained by the
commissioner or local agency. The potential enrollee is permitted to withdraw the request at any
time.
    The prepaid health plan shall submit sufficient paper versions of the primary care network list
to the commissioner and to local agencies within its service area to accommodate potential enrollee
requests for paper versions of the primary care network list.
    (d) A prepaid health plan may provide in an alternative format materials otherwise required to
be available in writing under Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 438.10, or under the
commissioner's contract with the prepaid health plan, if the conditions of paragraphs (b), (c), and
(e), are met for persons who are eligible for enrollment in managed care.
    (e) The commissioner shall seek any federal Medicaid waivers within 90 days after the effective
date of this subdivision that are necessary to provide alternative formats of required material to
enrollees of prepaid health plans as authorized under this subdivision.
   (f) The commissioner shall consult with managed care plans, county-based purchasing plans,
counties, and other interested parties to determine how materials required to be made available to
enrollees under Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 438.10, or under the commissioner's
contract with a prepaid health plan may be provided in an alternative format on the basis that the
enrollee has not opted in to receive the alternative format. The commissioner shall consult with
managed care plans, county-based purchasing plans, counties, and other interested parties to develop
recommendations relating to the conditions that must be met for an opt-out process to be granted.

    The county agency must report to the commissioner within 30 days on any waiver granted under
this section. The county shall not deny an application solely because the applicant does not meet at
least one of the criteria in this subdivision, but shall continue to process the application and leave
the application pending until the residency requirement is met or until eligibility or ineligibility is
established.

allotment authorized by the federal Food Stamp Program for a single individual which is in
effect on the first day of July of each year will be added to the standards of assistance established
in subdivisions 1 to 4 for adults under the age of 65 who qualify as shelter needy and are: (i)
relocating from an institution, or an adult mental health residential treatment program under section
256B.0622; (ii) eligible for the self-directed supports option as defined under section 256B.0657,
subdivision 2; or (iii) home and community-based waiver recipients living in their own home or
rented or leased apartment which is not owned, operated, or controlled by a provider of service not
related by blood or marriage, unless allowed under paragraph ­              (g­­

    (2) Notwithstanding subdivision 3, paragraph (c), an individual eligible for the shelter needy
benefit under this paragraph is considered a household of one. An eligible individual who receives
this benefit prior to age 65 may continue to receive the benefit after the age of 65.
    (3) "Shelter needy" means that the assistance unit incurs monthly shelter costs that exceed 40
percent of the assistance unit's gross income before the application of this special needs standard.
"Gross income" for the purposes of this section is the applicant's or recipient's income as defined
in section 256D.35, subdivision 10, or the standard specified in subdivision 3, paragraph (a) or (b),
whichever is greater. A recipient of a federal or state housing subsidy, that limits shelter costs to a
percentage of gross income, shall not be considered shelter needy for purposes of this paragraph.

    Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256D.49, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Overpayment of monthly grants and recovery of ATM errors. (a) When the
county agency determines that an overpayment of the recipient's monthly payment of Minnesota
supplemental aid has occurred, it shall issue a notice of overpayment to the recipient. If the person
is no longer receiving Minnesota supplemental aid, the county agency may request voluntary
repayment or pursue civil recovery. If the person is receiving Minnesota supplemental aid, the
county agency shall recover the overpayment by withholding an amount equal to three percent of
the standard of assistance for the recipient or the total amount of the monthly grant, whichever is
less.
   (b) Establishment of an overpayment is limited to 12 months from the date of discovery due to
agency error. Establishment of an overpayment is limited to six years prior to the month of discovery
due to client error or an intentional program violation determined under section 256.046.
    (c) For recipients receiving benefits via electronic benefit transfer, if the overpayment is a result
of an automated teller machine (ATM) dispensing funds in error to the recipient, the agency may
recover the ATM error by immediately withdrawing funds from the recipient's electronic benefit
transfer account, up to the amount of the error.

15 of each year starting January 15, 2011, the steering committee shall report its recommendations
to the governor and legislative committees with jurisdiction over health and human services. As
part of its report, the steering committee shall, as appropriate, recommend statutory provisions,
rules and requirements, and reports that should be repealed or eliminated.
    (c) As far as possible, the performance measures, reporting system, and funding shall be
consistent across program areas. The development of performance measures shall consider the
manner in which data will be collected and performance will be reported. The steering committee
shall consider state and local administrative costs related to collecting data and reporting outcomes
when developing performance measures. T            ­h­­

committee shall also identify and incorporate federal performance measures in its recommendations
for those program areas where federal funding is contingent on meeting federal performance
standards. The steering committee shall take into consideration that the goal of implementing
changes to program monitoring and reporting the progress toward achieving outcomes is to
significantly minimize the cost of administrative requirements and to allow funds freed by reduced
administrative expenditures to be used to provide additional services, allow flexibility in service
design and management, and focus energies on achieving program and client outcomes.
     (d) In making its recommendations, the steering committee shall consider input from the

      Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 518A.51, is amended to read:
      518A.51 FEES FOR IV-D SERVICES.
    (a) When a recipient of IV-D services is no longer receiving assistance under the state's title IV-A,
IV-E foster care, medical assistance, or MinnesotaCare programs, the public authority responsible
for child support enforcement must notify the recipient, within five working days of the notification
of ineligibility, that IV-D services will be continued unless the public authority is notified to the
contrary by the recipient. The notice must include the implications of continuing to receive IV-D
services, including the available services and fees, cost recovery fees, and distribution policies
relating to fees.
   (b) An application fee of $25 shall be paid by the person who applies for child support and
maintenance collection services, except persons who are receiving public assistance as defined in
820                                   JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                      [32ND DAY

section 256.741 and the diversionary work program under section 256J.95, persons who transfer
from public assistance to nonpublic assistance status, and minor parents and parents enrolled in
a public secondary school, area learning center, or alternative learning program approved by the
commissioner of education.
    (c) In the case of an individual who has never received assistance under a state program funded
under title IV-A of the Social Security Act and for whom the public authority has collected at least
$500 of support, the public authority must impose an annual federal collections fee of $25 for each
case in which services are furnished. This fee must be retained by the public authority from support
collected on behalf of the individual, but not from the first $500 collected.
    (d) When the public authority provides full IV-D services to an obligee who has applied for those
services, upon written notice to the obligee, the public authority must charge a cost recovery fee of
­n
o­­e two percent of the amount collected. This fee must be deducted from the amount of the child
support and maintenance collected and not assigned under section 256.741 before disbursement to
the obligee. This fee does not apply to an obligee who:
    (1) is currently receiving assistance under the state's title IV-A, IV-E foster care, medical
assistance, or MinnesotaCare programs; or
   (2) has received assistance under the state's title IV-A or IV-E foster care programs, until the
person has not received this assistance for 24 consecutive months.
    (e) When the public authority provides full IV-D services to an obligor who has applied for such
services, upon written notice to the obligor, the public authority must charge a cost recovery fee
of o
   ­n­­
      e two percent of the monthly court-ordered child support and maintenance obligation. The fee
may be collected through income withholding, as well as by any other enforcement remedy available
to the public authority responsible for child support enforcement.
    (f) Fees assessed by state and federal tax agencies for collection of overdue support owed to or
on behalf of a person not receiving public assistance must be imposed on the person for whom these
services are provided. The public authority upon written notice to the obligee shall assess a fee of
$25 to the person not receiving public assistance for each successful federal tax interception. The
fee must be withheld prior to the release of the funds received from each interception and deposited
in the general fund.
    (g) Federal collections fees collected under paragraph (c) and cost recovery fees collected under
paragraphs (d) and (e) retained by the commissioner of human services shall be considered child
support program income according to Code of Federal Regulations, title 45, section 304.50, and shall
be deposited in the special revenue fund account established under paragraph (i). The commissioner
of human services must elect to recover costs based on either actual or standardized costs.
   (h) The limitations of this section on the assessment of fees shall not apply to the extent
inconsistent with the requirements of federal law for receiving funds for the programs under title
IV-A and title IV-D of the Social Security Act, United States Code, title 42, sections 601 to 613
and United States Code, title 42, sections 651 to 662.
    (i) The commissioner of human services is authorized to establish a special revenue fund account
to receive the federal collections fees collected under paragraph (c) and cost recovery fees collected
under paragraphs (d) and (e). A  ­­

federal waivers needed to implement this section.
   Sec. 36. REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS; COMBINED ONLINE APPLICATION.
    (a) The commissioner of human services shall issue a request for proposals for a contract to
implement an integrated online eligibility and application portal for food support, cash assistance,
child care, and health care programs. The request for proposals must require that the system
recommended and implemented by the contractor:
    (1) streamline eligibility determination and case processing in the state to support statewide
eligibility processing;
    (2) enable interested persons to determine their eligibility for each program, and to apply for
programs online in a manner that asks the applicant only those questions that relate to the programs
the person is applying for;
   (3) leverage technology that has been operational in production in other similar state
environments; and
    (4) include Web-based application and worker application processing support and opportunity
for expansion.
    (b) If responses to the request for proposals meet the requirements under paragraph (a), the
commissioner shall enter into a contract for the services specified in paragraph (a) by January 31,
2012. The contract must incorporate a performance-based vendor financing option whereby the
vendor contributes the nonfederal share of the cost. If the commissioner determines that an adequate
vendor cannot be chosen based on responses to the request for proposals, the commissioner shall
report back to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees having
jurisdiction over health and human services prior to the January 31, 2012, contract date.

representatives, shall analyze the differences in asset limit requirements across human services
assistance programs, including group residential housing, Minnesota supplemental aid, general
assistance, Minnesota family investment program, diversionary work program, the federal
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, state food assistance programs, and child care
programs. The goal of the analysis is to establish a consistent asset limit across human services
programs and minimize the administrative burdens on counties in implementing asset tests. The
commissioner shall report its findings and conclusions to the health and human services legislative
committees by January 15, 2012, and include draft legislation establishing a uniform asset limit
for human services assistance programs.

legislature describing the results of this analysis and outlining proposals to improve the ability
of human services programs to help people who are interested in marriage to form and sustain
healthy marriages in which to raise children. The commissioner shall ensure that experts on healthy
marriage are consulted on the process of conducting the analysis and writing the report.

                                              ­­) (4), an applicant shall apply for a license to provide
services at a specific location.
    (1) For a license to provide residential-based habilitation services to persons with developmental
disabilities under chapter 245B, an applicant shall submit an application for each county in which
the services will be provided. Upon licensure, the license holder may provide services to persons in
that county plus no more than three persons at any one time in each of up to ten additional counties. A
license holder in one county may not provide services under the home and community-based waiver
for persons with developmental disabilities to more than three people in a second county without
holding a separate license for that second county. Applicants or licensees providing services under
this clause to not more than three persons remain subject to the inspection fees established in section
245A.10, subdivision 2, for each location. The license issued by the commissioner must state the
name of each additional county where services are being provided to persons with developmental
disabilities. A license holder must notify the commissioner before making any changes that would
alter the license information listed under section 245A.04, subdivision 7, paragraph (a), including
any additional counties where persons with developmental disabilities are being served.
    (2) For a license to provide supported employment, crisis respite, or semi-independent living
services to persons with developmental disabilities under chapter 245B, an applicant shall submit a
single application to provide services statewide.
   (3) For a license to provide independent living assistance for youth under section 245A.22, an
applicant shall submit a single application to provide services statewide.
    (4) For a license for a private agency to provide foster care or adoption services under Minnesota
Rules, parts 9545.0755 to 9545.0845, an applicant shall submit a single application to provide
services statewide.

   Subdivision 1. Citation. This section shall be known as and may be cited as the "Freedom of
Choice in Health Care Act."
   Subd. 2. Definitions. (a) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meaning
given them.
    (b) "Health care service" means any service, treatment, or provision of a product for the care
of a physical or mental disease, illness, injury, defect, or condition, or to otherwise maintain or
improve physical or mental health, subject to all laws and rules regulating health service providers
and products within the state of Minnesota.
    (c) "Mode of securing" means to purchase directly or on credit or by trade, or to contract for
third-party payment by insurance or other legal means as authorized by the state of Minnesota, or to
apply for or accept employer-sponsored or government-sponsored health care benefits under such
conditions as may legally be required as a condition of such benefits, or any combination of the
same.
    (d) "Penalty" means any civil or criminal fine, tax, salary or wage withholding, surcharge, fee,
or any other imposed consequence established by law or rule of a government or its subdivision or
agency that is used to punish or discourage the exercise of rights protected under this section.
    Subd. 3. Statement of public policy. (a) The power to require or regulate a person's choice in
the mode of securing health care services, or to impose a penalty related to that choice, is not found
in the Constitution of the United States of America, and is therefore a power reserved to the people
pursuant to the Ninth Amendment, and to the several states pursuant to the Tenth Amendment. The
state of Minnesota hereby exercises its sovereign power to declare the public policy of the state of
Minnesota regarding the right of all persons residing in the state in choosing the mode of securing
health care services.
    (b) It is hereby declared that the public policy of the state of Minnesota, consistent with our
constitutionally recognized and inalienable rights of liberty, is that every person within the state
of Minnesota is and shall be free to choose or decline to choose any mode of securing health care
services without penalty or threat of penalty.
    (c) The policy stated under this section shall not be applied to impair any right of contract related
to the provision of health care services to any person or group.
    Subd. 4. Enforcement. (a) No public official, employee, or agent of the state of Minnesota or
any of its political subdivisions shall act to impose, collect, enforce, or effectuate any penalty in the
state of Minnesota that violates the public policy set forth in this section.
   (b) The attorney general shall take any action as is provided in this section or section 8.31 in the
defense or prosecution of rights protected under this section.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 8.31, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Investigate offenses against provisions of certain designated sections;
assist in enforcement. (a) The attorney general shall investigate violations of the law of this

trade, and specifically, but not exclusively, the Nonprofit Corporation Act (sections 317A.001 to
317A.909), the Act Against Unfair Discrimination and Competition (sections 325D.01 to 325D.07),

the Prevention of Consumer Fraud Act (sections 325F.68 to 325F.70), and chapter 53A regulating
currency exchanges and assist in the enforcement of those laws as in this section provided.
    (b) The attorney general shall seek injunctive and any other appropriate relief as expeditiously as
possible to preserve the rights and property of the residents of Minnesota, and to defend as necessary
the state of Minnesota, its officials, employees, and agents in the event that any law or regulation
violating the public policy set forth in the Freedom of Choice in Health Care Act in this section is
enacted by any government, subdivision, or agency thereof.
    (c) The attorney general shall seek injunctive and any other appropriate relief as expeditiously as
possible in the event that any law or regulation violating the public policy set forth in the Freedom
of Choice in Health Care Act in this section is enacted without adequate federal funding to the state

assistance and shall not include property cost information and costs recognized in outlier payments.

    Subd. 12. Eyeglasses, dentures, and prosthetic devices. Medical assistance covers eyeglasses,
dentures, and prosthetic devices for eligible recipients under 21 years of age if prescribed by a
licensed practitioner.
    Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0625, subdivision 13e, is amended to read:
    Subd. 13e. Payment rates. (a) The basis for determining the amount of payment shall be the
lower of the actual acquisition costs of the drugs plus a fixed dispensing fee; the maximum allowable
cost set by the federal government or by the commissioner plus the fixed dispensing fee; or the
usual and customary price charged to the public. The amount of payment basis must be reduced
to reflect all discount amounts applied to the charge by any provider/insurer agreement or contract
for submitted charges to medical assistance programs. The net submitted charge may not be greater
than the patient liability for the service. The pharmacy dispensing fee shall be $3.65, except that
the dispensing fee for intravenous solutions which must be compounded by the pharmacist shall
be $8 per bag, $14 per bag for cancer chemotherapy products, and $30 per bag for total parenteral
nutritional products dispensed in one liter quantities, or $44 per bag for total parenteral nutritional
products dispensed in quantities greater than one liter. Actual acquisition cost includes quantity
and other special discounts except time and cash discounts. Effective ­                  Ju

Wholesale acquisition cost is defined as the manufacturer's list price for a drug or biological to
wholesalers or direct purchasers in the United States, not including prompt pay or other discounts,
rebates, or reductions in price, for the most recent month for which information is available, as
reported in wholesale price guides or other publications of drug or biological pricing data. The
maximum allowable cost of a multisource drug may be set by the commissioner and it shall be
comparable to, but no higher than, the maximum amount paid by other third-party payors in this
state who have maximum allowable cost programs. Establishment of the amount of payment for
drugs shall not be subject to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (b) An additional dispensing fee of $.30 may be added to the dispensing fee paid to pharmacists
for legend drug prescriptions dispensed to residents of long-term care facilities when a unit dose
blister card system, approved by the department, is used. Under this type of dispensing system, the
pharmacist must dispense a 30-day supply of drug. The National Drug Code (NDC) from the drug
container used to fill the blister card must be identified on the claim to the department. The unit dose
blister card containing the drug must meet the packaging standards set forth in Minnesota Rules,
part 6800.2700, that govern the return of unused drugs to the pharmacy for reuse. The pharmacy
provider will be required to credit the department for the actual acquisition cost of all unused drugs
that are eligible for reuse. Over-the-counter medications must be dispensed in the manufacturer's
unopened package. The commissioner may permit the drug clozapine to be dispensed in a quantity
that is less than a 30-day supply.
    (c) Whenever a maximum allowable cost has been set for a multisource drug, payment shall be on
the basis of the maximum allowable cost established by the commissioner unless prior authorization
for the brand name product has been granted according to the criteria established by the Drug
Formulary Committee as required by subdivision 13f, paragraph (a), and the prescriber has indicated
"dispense as written" on the prescription in a manner consistent with section 151.21, subdivision 2.

States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to title XVIII, section 1847a of the
federal Social Security Act. If the average sales price is unavailable, the amount of payment shall
be the lower of the usual and customary cost submitted by the provider or the wholesale acquisition
cost.
    (e) The commissioner may negotiate lower reimbursement rates for specialty pharmacy
products than the rates specified in paragraph (a). The commissioner may require individuals
enrolled in the health care programs administered by the department to obtain specialty pharmacy
products from providers with whom the commissioner has negotiated lower reimbursement rates.
Specialty pharmacy products are defined as those used by a small number of recipients or recipients
with complex and chronic diseases that require expensive and challenging drug regimens. Examples
of these conditions include, but are not limited to: multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, transplantation,
hepatitis C, growth hormone deficiency, Crohn's Disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and certain forms of
cancer. Specialty pharmaceutical products include injectable and infusion therapies, biotechnology
drugs, antihemophilic factor products, high-cost therapies, and therapies that require complex
care. The commissioner shall consult with the formulary committee to develop a list of specialty
pharmacy products subject to this paragraph. In consulting with the formulary committee in
developing this list, the commissioner shall take into consideration the population served by
specialty pharmacy products, the current delivery system and standard of care in the state, and
access to care issues. The commissioner shall have the discretion to adjust the reimbursement rate
to prevent access to care issues.
    (f) Home infusion therapy services provided by home infusion therapy pharmacies must be paid
at rates according to subdivision 8d.
    Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0625, subdivision 17, is amended to read:
    Subd. 17. Transportation costs. (a) Medical assistance covers medical transportation costs
incurred solely for obtaining emergency medical care or transportation costs incurred by eligible
persons in obtaining emergency or nonemergency medical care when paid directly to an ambulance
company, common carrier, or other recognized providers of transportation services. Medical
transportation must be provided by:
    (1) an ambulance, as defined in section 144E.001, subdivision 2;
    (2) special transportation; or
    (3) common carrier including, but not limited to, bus, taxicab, other commercial carrier, or
private automobile.
    (b) Medical assistance covers special transportation, as defined in Minnesota Rules, part
9505.0315, subpart 1, item F, if the recipient has a physical or mental impairment that would
prohibit the recipient from safely accessing and using a bus, taxi, other commercial transportation,
or private automobile.
The commissioner may use an order by the recipient's attending physician to certify that the
recipient requires special transportation services. Special transportation providers shall perform

driver-assisted services for eligible individuals. Driver-assisted service includes passenger pickup
at and return to the individual's residence or place of business, assistance with admittance of
the individual to the medical facility, and assistance in passenger securement or in securing of
wheelchairs or stretchers in the vehicle. Special transportation providers must obtain written
documentation from the health care service provider who is serving the recipient being transported,
identifying the time that the recipient arrived. Special transportation providers may not bill
for separate base rates for the continuation of a trip beyond the original destination. Special
transportation providers must take recipients to the nearest appropriate health care provider,
using the most direct route. The minimum medical assistance reimbursement rates for special
transportation services are:
   (1) (i) $17 for the base rate and $1.35 per mile for special transportation services to eligible
persons who need a wheelchair-accessible van;
   (ii) $11.50 for the base rate and $1.30 per mile for special transportation services to eligible
persons who do not need a wheelchair-accessible van; and
    (iii) $60 for the base rate and $2.40 per mile, and an attendant rate of $9 per trip, for special
transportation services to eligible persons who need a stretcher-accessible vehicle;
    (2) the base rates for special transportation services in areas defined under RUCA to be super
rural shall be equal to the reimbursement rate established in clause (1) plus 11.3 percent; and
    (3) for special transportation services in areas defined under RUCA to be rural or super rural
areas:
    (i) for a trip equal to 17 miles or less, mileage reimbursement shall be equal to 125 percent of
the respective mileage rate in clause (1); and
    (ii) for a trip between 18 and 50 miles, mileage reimbursement shall be equal to 112.5 percent
of the respective mileage rate in clause (1).
    (c) For purposes of reimbursement rates for special transportation services under paragraph (b),
the zip code of the recipient's place of residence shall determine whether the urban, rural, or super
rural reimbursement rate applies.
    (d) For purposes of this subdivision, "rural urban commuting area" or "RUCA" means a
census-tract based classification system under which a geographical area is determined to be urban,
rural, or super rural.
    (e) Effective for services provided on or after July 1, 2011, nonemergency transportation rates,
including special transportation, taxi, and other commercial carriers, are reduced 4.5 percent.
Payments made to managed care plans and county-based purchasing plans must be reduced for
services provided on or after January 1, 2012, to reflect this reduction.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0625, subdivision 17a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 17a. Payment for ambulance services. (a) Medical assistance covers ambulance services.
Providers shall bill ambulance services according to Medicare criteria. Nonemergency ambulance
services shall not be paid as emergencies. Effective for services rendered on or after July 1, 2001,
medical assistance payments for ambulance services shall be paid at the Medicare reimbursement

rate or at the medical assistance payment rate in effect on July 1, 2000, whichever is greater.
    (b) Effective for services provided on or after July 1, 2011, ambulance services payment rates
are reduced 4.5 percent. Payments made to managed care plans and county-based purchasing plans

incurred by any ambulatory eligible person for obtaining nonemergency medical care.
   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0625, subdivision 25, is amended to read:
     Subd. 25. Prior authorization required. (a) The commissioner shall publish in the Minnesota
health care programs provider manual and on the department's Web site a list of health services that
require prior authorization, as well as the criteria and standards used to select health services on the
list. The list and the criteria and standards used to formulate it are not subject to the requirements of
sections 14.001 to 14.69. The commissioner's decision whether prior authorization is required for a
health service is not subject to administrative appeal.
    (b) The commissioner shall implement a modernized electronic system for providers to request
prior authorization. The modernization electronic system must include at least the following
functionalities:
   (1) authorizations are recipient-centric, not provider-centric;
    (2) adequate flexibility to support authorizations for an episode of care, continuous drug therapy,
or for individual onetime services and allows an ordering and a rendering provider to both submit
information into one request;
   (3) allows providers to review previous authorization requests and determine where a submitted
request is within the authorization process;
    (4) supports automated workflows that allow providers to securely submit medical information
that can be accessed by medical and pharmacy review vendors as well as department staff; and
   (5) supports development of automated clinical algorithms that can verify information and
provide responses in real time.
    (c) The system described in paragraph (b) shall be completed by March 1, 2012. All authorization
requests submitted on and after March 1, 2012, must be submitted electronically by providers, except
requests for drugs dispensed by an outpatient pharmacy, services that are provided outside of the
state and surrounding local trade area, and services included on a service agreement.
   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0625, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 25b. Authorization with third-party liability. (a) Except as otherwise allowed under
this subdivision or required under federal or state regulations, the commissioner must not consider
a request for authorization of a service when the recipient has coverage from a third-party payer
unless the provider requesting authorization has made a good faith effort to receive payment or

authorization from the third-party payer. A good faith effort is established by supplying with the
authorization request to the commissioner the following:
    (1) a determination of payment for the service from the third-party payer, a determination of
authorization for the service from the third-party payer, or a verification of noncoverage of the
service by the third-party payer; and
    (2) the information or records required by the department to document the reason for the
determination or to validate noncoverage from the third-party payer.
    (b) A provider requesting authorization for services covered by Medicare is not required to
bill Medicare before requesting authorization from the commissioner if the provider has reason to
believe that a service covered by Medicare is not eligible for payment. The provider must document
that, because of recent claim experiences with Medicare or because of written communication from
Medicare, coverage is not available for the service.
    (c) Authorization is not required if a third-party payer has made payment that is equal to or
greater than 60 percent of the maximum payment amount for the service allowed under medical
assistance.
      Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0625, subdivision 31a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 31a. Augmentative and alternative communication systems. (a) Medical assistance
covers augmentative and alternative communication systems consisting of electronic or
nonelectronic devices and the related components necessary to enable a person with severe
expressive communication limitations to produce or transmit messages or symbols in a manner
that compensates for that disability.

eligible for payment under the medical assistance program when the provider, prior to delivering the
service, reviews and considers all other available covered alternatives with the recipient and obtains
a signed acknowledgment from the recipient of the potential of the recipient's liability. The signed
acknowledgment must be in a form approved by the commissioner.
    (b) Conditions under which a provider must not request payment from the recipient include, but
are not limited to:
  (1) a service that requires prior authorization, unless authorization has been denied as not
medically necessary and all other therapeutic alternatives have been reviewed;
   (2) a service for which payment has been denied for reasons relating to billing requirements;
   (3) standard shipping or delivery and setup of medical equipment or medical supplies;
   (4) services that are included in the recipient's long term care per diem;
   (5) the recipient is enrolled in the Restricted Recipient Program and the provider is one of a
provider type designated for the recipient's health care services; and
    (6) the noncovered service is a prescriptive drug identified by the commissioner as having the
potential for abuse and overuse, except where payment by the recipient is specifically approved by
the commissioner on the date of service based upon compelling evidence supplied by the prescribing
provider that establishes medical necessity for that particular drug.
    (c) The payment requested from recipients for noncovered services under this subdivision must
not exceed the provider's usual and customary charge for the actual service received by the recipient.
A recipient must not be billed for the difference between what medical assistance paid for the service
or would pay for a less costly alternative service.
   Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0625, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 56. Evidence-based childbirth program. (a) The commissioner shall implement a
program to reduce the number of elective inductions of labor prior to 39 weeks' gestation. In this
subdivision, the term "elective induction of labor" means the use of artificial means to stimulate
labor in a woman without the presence of a medical condition affecting the woman or the child that
makes the onset of labor a medical necessity. The program must promote the implementation of
policies within hospitals providing services to recipients of medical assistance or MinnesotaCare
that prohibit the use of elective inductions prior to 39 weeks' gestation, and adherence to such
policies by the attending providers.
    (b) For all births covered by medical assistance or MinnesotaCare on or after January 1, 2012,
a payment for professional services associated with the delivery of a child in a hospital must not
be made unless the provider has submitted information about the nature of the labor and delivery
including any induction of labor that was performed in conjunction with that specific birth. The
information must be on a form prescribed by the commissioner.
    (c) The requirements in paragraph (b) must not apply to deliveries performed at a hospital that
has policies and processes in place that have been approved by the commissioner which prohibit
elective inductions prior to 39 weeks gestation. A process for review of hospital induction policies

must be established by the commissioner and review of policies must occur at the discretion of the
commissioner. The commissioner's decision to approve or rescind approval must include verification
and review of items including, but not limited to:
   (1) policies that prohibit use of elective inductions for gestation less than 39 weeks;
    (2) policies that encourage providers to document and communicate with patients a final
expected date of delivery by 20 weeks' gestation that includes data from ultrasound measurements
as applicable;
   (3) policies that encourage patient education regarding elective inductions, and requires
documentation of the processes used to educate patients;
   (4) ongoing quality improvement review as determined by the commissioner; and
   (5) any data that has been collected by the commissioner.
    (d) All hospitals must report annually to the commissioner induction information for all births
that were covered by medical assistance or MinnesotaCare in a format and manner to be established
by the commissioner.
   (e) The commissioner at any time may choose not to implement or may discontinue any or all
aspects of the program if the commissioner is able to determine that hospitals representing at least 90
percent of births covered by medical assistance or MinnesotaCare have approved policies in place.

(2) reside in Itasca County or reside in a county in which the commissioner conducts a pilot under
a waiver granted pursuant to section 1115 of the Social Security Act.
   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.69, subdivision 5a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 5a. Managed care contracts. (a) Managed care contracts under this section and section
256L.12 shall be entered into or renewed on a calendar year basis beginning January 1, 1996.
Managed care contracts which were in effect on June 30, 1995, and set to renew on July 1, 1995,
shall be renewed for the period July 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995 at the same terms that
were in effect on June 30, 1995. The commissioner may issue separate contracts with requirements
specific to services to medical assistance recipients age 65 and older.
   (b) A prepaid health plan providing covered health services for eligible persons pursuant to
chapters 256B and 256L is responsible for complying with the terms of its contract with the
commissioner. Requirements applicable to managed care programs under chapters 256B and
256L established after the effective date of a contract with the commissioner take effect when the
contract is next issued or renewed.
    (c) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2003, the commissioner shall withhold
five percent of managed care plan payments under this section and county-based purchasing plan
payments under section 256B.692 for the prepaid medical assistance program pending completion
of performance targets. Each performance target must be quantifiable, objective, measurable,
and reasonably attainable, except in the case of a performance target based on a federal or state
law or rule. Criteria for assessment of each performance target must be outlined in writing prior
to the contract effective date. The managed care plan must demonstrate, to the commissioner's
satisfaction, that the data submitted regarding attainment of the performance target is accurate.
The commissioner shall periodically change the administrative measures used as performance
targets in order to improve plan performance across a broader range of administrative services. The
performance targets must include measurement of plan efforts to contain spending on health care
services and administrative activities. The commissioner may adopt plan-specific performance
targets that take into account factors affecting only one plan, including characteristics of the plan's

demonstration projects under subdivision 23.
    (d) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2009, the

following year. The commissioner may exclude special demonstration projects under subdivision
23.
    (e) Effective for services provided on or after January 1, 2010, the commissioner shall require
that managed care plans use the assessment and authorization processes, forms, timelines, standards,
documentation, and data reporting requirements, protocols, billing processes, and policies consistent
with medical assistance fee-for-service or the Department of Human Services contract requirements
consistent with medical assistance fee-for-service or the Department of Human Services contract
requirements for all personal care assistance services under section 256B.0659.
    (f) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2010, the

county-based purchasing plan payments under section 256B.692 for the prepaid medical assistance
program. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the
following year. The commissioner may exclude special demonstration projects under subdivision
23.
    (g) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2011, the commissioner shall include as
part of the performance targets described in paragraph (c) a reduction in the health plan's emergency
room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees by a measurable rate of five percent from
the plan's utilization rate for state health care program enrollees for the previous calendar year.
    The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of
the following calendar year if the managed care plan demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
commissioner that a reduction in the utilization rate was achieved.
    The withhold described in this paragraph shall continue for each consecutive contract period
until the plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees is reduced
by 25 percent of the plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees
for calendar year 2009. Hospitals shall cooperate with the health plans in meeting this performance
target and shall accept payment withholds that may be returned to the hospitals if the performance
target is achieved. The commissioner shall structure the withhold so that the commissioner returns a
portion of the withheld funds in amounts commensurate with achieved reductions in utilization less
than the targeted amount. The withhold in this paragraph does not apply to county-based purchasing
plans.
    (h) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2012, the commissioner shall
include as part of the performance targets described in paragraph (c) a reduction in the plan's
hospitalization rates or subsequent hospitalizations within 30 days of a previous hospitalization of
a patient regardless of the reason for the hospitalization for state health care program enrollees
by a measurable rate of five percent from the plan's utilization rate for state health care program
enrollees for the previous calendar year.

    The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the
following calendar year if the managed care plan or county-based purchasing plan demonstrates to
the satisfaction of the commissioner that a reduction in the hospitalization rate was achieved.
    The withhold described in this paragraph must continue for each consecutive contract period
until the plan's subsequent hospitalization rate for state health care program enrollees is reduced by
25 percent of the plan's subsequent hospitalization rate for state health care program enrollees for
calendar year 2010. Hospitals shall cooperate with the plans in meeting this performance target and
shall accept payment withholds that must be returned to the hospitals if the performance target is
achieved. The commissioner shall structure the withhold so that the commissioner returns a portion
of the withheld funds in amounts commensurate with achieved reductions in utilization less than
the targeted amount.

shall be allowed to choose among the systems. The commissioner may assign an applicant or
recipient to a coordinated care delivery system if no choice is made by the applicant or recipient
or under paragraph (k). The commissioner shall consider a recipient's zip code, city of residence,
county of residence, or distance from a participating coordinated care delivery system when
determining default assignment. An applicant or recipient may decline enrollment in a coordinated
care delivery system but services are only available through a coordinated care delivery system.
Upon enrollment into a coordinated care delivery system, the recipient must agree to receive all
nonemergency services through the coordinated care delivery system. Enrollment in a coordinated
care delivery system is for six months and may be renewed for additional six-month periods,
except that initial enrollment is for six months or until the end of a recipient's period of general
assistance medical care eligibility, whichever occurs first. A                                          ­­­­r­

    (d) The hospital may contract and coordinate with providers and clinics for the delivery of
services and shall contract with essential community providers as defined under section 62Q.19,
subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clauses (1) and (2), to the extent practicable. If a provider or clinic
contracts with a hospital to provide services through the coordinated care delivery system, the
provider may not refuse to provide services to any recipient enrolled in the system, and payment for
services shall be negotiated with the hospital and paid by the hospital from the system's allocation
under subdivision 7.
      (e) A coordinated care delivery system must:
    (1) provide the covered services required under paragraph (a) to recipients enrolled in the
coordinated care delivery system, and comply with the requirements of subdivision 4, paragraphs
(b) to (g);
      (2) establish a process to monitor enrollment and ensure the quality of care provided;
    (3) in cooperation with counties, coordinate the delivery of health care services with existing
homeless prevention, supportive housing, and rent subsidy programs and funding administered by
the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency under chapter 462A; and
    (4) adopt innovative and cost-effective methods of care delivery and coordination, which may
include the use of allied health professionals, telemedicine, patient educators, care coordinators, and
community health workers.
    (f) The hospital may require a recipient to designate a primary care provider or a primary care
clinic. The hospital may limit the delivery of services to a network of providers who have contracted
with the hospital to deliver services in accordance with this subdivision, and require a recipient
to seek services only within this network. The hospital may also require a referral to a provider
before the service is eligible for payment. A coordinated care delivery system is not required to
provide payment to a provider who is not employed by or under contract with the system for services
provided to a recipient enrolled in the system, except in cases of an emergency. For purposes of this
section, emergency services are defined in accordance with Code of Federal Regulations, title 42,

section 438.114 (a).
   (g) A recipient enrolled in a coordinated care delivery system has the right to appeal to the
commissioner according to section 256.045.
   (h) The state shall not be liable for the payment of any cost or obligation incurred by the
coordinated care delivery system.
    (i) The hospital must provide the commissioner with data necessary for assessing enrollment,
quality of care, cost, and utilization of services. Each hospital must provide, on a quarterly basis on
a form prescribed by the commissioner for each recipient served by the coordinated care delivery
system, the services provided, the cost of services provided, and the actual payment amount for the
services provided and any other information the commissioner deems necessary to claim federal
Medicaid match. The commissioner must provide this data to the legislature on a quarterly basis.

for calendar year 2009. Hospitals shall cooperate with the health plans in meeting this performance
target and shall accept payment withholds that may be returned to the hospitals if the performance
target is achieved. The commissioner shall structure the withhold so that the commissioner returns a
portion of the withheld funds in amounts commensurate with achieved reductions in utilization less

achieved. The commissioner shall structure the withhold so that the commissioner returns a portion
of the withheld funds in amounts commensurate with achieved reductions in utilizations less than
the targeted amount. The withhold described in this paragraph does not apply to county-based
purchasing plans.

    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 62J.692, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Distribution of funds. (a) Following the distribution described under paragraph (b),
the commissioner shall annually distribute the available medical education funds to all qualifying
applicants based on a distribution formula that reflects a summation of two factors:
    (1) a public program volume factor, which is determined by the total volume of public program
revenue received by each training site as a percentage of all public program revenue received by all
training sites in the fund pool; and
    (2) a supplemental public program volume factor, which is determined by providing a
supplemental payment of 20 percent of each training site's grant to training sites whose public
program revenue accounted for at least 0.98 percent of the total public program revenue received
by all eligible training sites. Grants to training sites whose public program revenue accounted for
less than 0.98 percent of the total public program revenue received by all eligible training sites
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the total value of the supplemental payment.
    Public program revenue for the distribution formula includes revenue from medical assistance,
prepaid medical assistance, general assistance medical care, and prepaid general assistance medical
care. Training sites that receive no public program revenue are ineligible for funds available under
this subdivision. For purposes of determining training-site level grants to be distributed under
paragraph (a), total statewide average costs per trainee for medical residents is based on audited
clinical training costs per trainee in primary care clinical medical education programs for medical
residents. Total statewide average costs per trainee for dental residents is based on audited clinical
training costs per trainee in clinical medical education programs for dental students. Total statewide
average costs per trainee for pharmacy residents is based on audited clinical training costs per
trainee in clinical medical education programs for pharmacy students.

                                             DEFINITIONS
   As used in this compact:

    (1) investigative information that a licensing board, after a preliminary inquiry that includes
notification and an opportunity for the nurse to respond if required by state law, has reason to believe

   (2) investigative information that indicates that the nurse represents an immediate threat to public
health and safety regardless of whether the nurse has been notified and had an opportunity to respond.
   (e) "Home state" means the party state which is the nurse's primary state of residence.
    (f) "Home state action" means any administrative, civil, equitable, or criminal action permitted

                                               ARTICLE 2
                           GENERAL PROVISIONS AND JURISDICTION
    (a) A license to practice registered nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will
be recognized by each party state as authorizing a multistate licensure privilege to practice as a
registered nurse in the party state. A license to practice licensed practical/vocational nursing issued
by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a
multistate licensure privilege to practice as a licensed practical/vocational nurse in the party state.
In order to obtain or retain a license, an applicant must meet the home state's qualifications for
licensure and license renewal as well as all other applicable state laws.
    (b) Party states may, according to state due process laws, limit or revoke the multistate licensure
privilege of any nurse to practice in their state and may take any other actions under their applicable
state laws necessary to protect the health and safety of their citizens. If a party state takes such
action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system.
The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home
state of any such actions by remote states.
    (c) Every nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state
in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered. In addition, the practice of nursing is not
limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of
the party state. The practice of nursing will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the nurse licensing
board, the courts, and the laws in the party state.
    (d) This compact does not affect additional requirements imposed by states for advanced practice
registered nursing. However, a multistate licensure privilege to practice registered nursing granted
by a party state shall be recognized by other party states as a license to practice registered nursing if
one is required by state law as a precondition for qualifying for advanced practice registered nurse
authorization.
    (e) Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for nurse licensure
as provided for under the laws of each party state. However, the license granted to these individuals
will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice nursing in any other party state unless
explicitly agreed to by that party state.
32ND DAY]                          MONDAY, MARCH 28, 2011                                          893

                                              ARTICLE 3
                      APPLICATIONS FOR LICENSURE IN A PARTY STATE
    (a) Upon application for a license, the licensing board in a party state shall ascertain, through
the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held or is the holder
of a license issued by any other state, whether there are any restrictions on the multistate licensure
privilege, and whether any other adverse action by a state has been taken against the license.
   (b) A nurse in a party state shall hold licensure in only one party state at a time, issued by the
home state.
    (c) A nurse who intends to change primary state of residence may apply for licensure in the new
home state in advance of the change. However, new licenses will not be issued by a party state until
after a nurse provides evidence of change in primary state of residence satisfactory to the new home
state's licensing board.
   (d) When a nurse changes primary state of residence by:
   (1) moving between two party states, and obtains a license from the new home state, the license
from the former home state is no longer valid;
    (2) moving from a nonparty state to a party state, and obtains a license from the new home state,
the individual state license issued by the nonparty state is not affected and will remain in full force
if so provided by the laws of the nonparty state; or
    (3) moving from a party state to a nonparty state, the license issued by the prior home state
converts to an individual state license, valid only in the former home state, without the multistate
licensure privilege to practice in other party states.
                                              ARTICLE 4
                                         ADVERSE ACTIONS
   In addition to the general provisions described in article 2, the provisions in this article apply.
    (a) The licensing board of a remote state shall promptly report to the administrator of the
coordinated licensure information system any remote state actions including the factual and legal
basis for the action, if known. The licensing board of a remote state shall also promptly report any
significant current investigative information yet to result in a remote state action. The administrator
of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any reports.
    (b) The licensing board of a party state shall have the authority to complete any pending
investigation for a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of the
investigation. The board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action, and shall promptly
report the conclusion of the investigation to the administrator of the coordinated licensure
information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall
promptly notify the new home state of any action.
   (c) A remote state may take adverse action affecting the multistate licensure privilege to practice
within that party state. However, only the home state shall have the power to impose adverse action
against the license issued by the home state.

    (d) For purposes of imposing adverse actions, the licensing board of the home state shall give
the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if the
conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, it shall apply its own state laws to determine
appropriate action.
   (e) The home state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state,
provided each state follows its own procedures for imposing the adverse action.
    (f) Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an
alternative program may be used in lieu of licensure action and that participation shall remain
nonpublic if required by the party state's laws.
   Party states must require nurses who enter any alternative programs to agree not to practice in
any other party state during the term of the alternative program without prior authorization from the
other party state.

                           PARTY STATE NURSE LICENSING BOARDS
   Notwithstanding any other laws, party state nurse licensing boards shall have the authority to:
   (1) if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected nurse the costs of investigation
and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that nurse;
    (2) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations which require the attendance and
testimony of witnesses, and the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a nurse licensing
board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and the production of evidence
from another party state, shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction
according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings
pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and
other fees required by the service statutes of the state where the witnesses and evidence are located;
    (3) issue cease and desist orders to limit or revoke a nurse's authority to practice in the nurse's
state; and
   (4) adopt uniform rules and regulations as provided for in article 7, paragraph (c).

                     COORDINATED LICENSURE INFORMATION SYSTEM
    (a) All party states shall participate in a cooperative effort to create a coordinated database of
all licensed registered nurses and licensed practical/vocational nurses. This system shall include
information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each nurse, as contributed by party states,
to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and enforcement efforts.
   (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party states' licensing boards shall promptly
report adverse actions, actions against multistate licensure privileges, any current significant
investigative information yet to result in adverse action, denials of applications, and the reasons

    (c) Current significant investigative information shall be transmitted through the coordinated
licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.
    (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party states' licensing boards contributing
information to the coordinated licensure information system may designate information that may
not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express
permission of the contributing state.
    (e) Any personally identifiable information obtained by a party state's licensing board from the
coordinated licensure information system may not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to
other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing
the information.
   (f) Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is
subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that information
shall also be expunged from the coordinated licensure information system.
   (g) The compact administrators, acting jointly with each other and in consultation with the
administrator of the coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and proper
procedures for the identification, collection, and exchange of information under this compact.

of this compact for that state.
    (b) The compact administrator of each party state shall furnish to the compact administrator of
each other party state any information and documents including, but not limited to, a uniform data
set of investigations, identifying information, licensure data, and disclosable alternative program
participation information to facilitate the administration of this compact.

and provided that the aircraft is not thereafter returned to a point within Minnesota, except in the
course of interstate commerce or isolated and occasional use, and will be registered in another state

     Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 297A.99, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. General authority; certain cities. (a) A city, or a group of cities acting under a
joint powers agreement, may impose a local sales and use tax of one-half of one percent without
authorization under a special law provided that:
   (1) imposition of the tax is approved by the voters of each city at a general election pursuant to
subdivision 3, paragraph (a); and
   (2) all the conditions for adoption, use, and termination of the tax contained in this subdivision
and subdivisions 3 to 12 are met.
   The authority under this section is in addition to any local sales tax authority permitted under
special law.
    (b) The proceeds of a tax imposed under this subdivision must be dedicated exclusively to pay
for specific capital projects approved by the voters in the authorizing referendum. No proceeds may
be used for normal maintenance or operating costs of a facility or properties owned by a city or group
of cities. The proceeds may be used to pay for collecting and administering the tax, to pay all or
part of the capital costs of the development, acquisition, construction, expansion, and improvement,
and to secure and pay debt service on bonds or other obligations issued to finance capital costs of a
regional project, including the following:
     (1) convention or civic center;
     (2) public libraries;
     (3) parks, trails, and recreational centers;

   (6) flood control and protection;
   (7) water quality projects to address groundwater and drinking water pollution problems;
   (8) court facilities;
   (9) fire, law enforcement, or public safety facilities; or
   (10) municipal buildings.
    (c) At least three months prior to holding a referendum to impose the tax, a city must provide
to the commissioner of revenue a resolution approved by the city that shows that the tax will fund
a project that meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) to (c), the date on which the referendum
will be held, the maximum amount raised by the tax that may be used for the specified project,
excluding issuance and interest costs for any related bonds, and the maximum time that the tax may
be imposed. The commissioner shall certify that the requirements under this subdivision are met and
the city shall provide any additional information on the commissioner's requests in order to make
that determination. The commissioner's decision is final.
    (d) The question put to the voters at the referendum authorizing the vote must include
information on the specific project or projects to be funded by the proceeds of the tax, the maximum
amount of sales tax revenues that will be used to fund each project, not including any issuance
and interest costs for related bonds, and the maximum length of time that the tax will be imposed,

increase in the rate. If the referendum is not held on the date contained in the resolution, the
authority for imposing the tax expires.
    (e) A city may issue general obligation bonds to pay the costs of projects specified in the
referendum authorizing imposition of the tax. The approval of the question under paragraph (d)

applicable to the city, and the levy of taxes required by section 475.61 to pay the principal or any
interest on the bonds must not be subject to any levy limitations or be included in computing or

    (f) The tax, if enacted, expires when the specified revenue has been raised or the maximum time
in which the tax is in effect under the resolution is reached, whichever is sooner. Any tax imposed
under this subdivision must expire no later than ten years after imposition from the date the initial
tax was imposed without regard to an increase in the rate. The governing board of the city may, by
ordinance, terminate the tax at an earlier date. A city must not impose a new local option sales and
use tax until a previously authorized one has been terminated.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for local sales taxes for which the authorizing
referendum is held after June 30, 2011.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 297A.99, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Requirements for adoption, use, termination. (a) Imposition of a local sales tax is

under subdivision 1a after June 30, 2011, is subject to a reduction in the amount of aid the city is
otherwise eligible to receive under section 477A.013, as provided in this subdivision.
    The amount of the sales tax collected for the calendar year is deducted from the aid the home
rule charter or statutory city would otherwise receive under section 477A.013 in the following year,
but only to the extent of the amount of aid paid to that city that is attributable to the sum of: (1) any
aid base increase under section 477A.011, subdivision 36, paragraph (k); and (2) any aid increase
due to its city jobs base under section 477.013, subdivision 8.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for aids payable in 2012 and thereafter.

an aid distribution equal to the sum of (1) the city formula aid under subdivision 8, and (2) its city
aid base.
     (b) For aids payable in 2011 only, the total aid in the previous year for any city shall mean the
amount of aid it was certified to receive for aids payable in 2010 under this section minus the amount
of its aid reduction under section 477A.0134. For aids payable in 2012 and thereafter, the total aid in
the previous year for any city means the amount of aid it was certified to receive under this section
in the previous payable year.
    (c) For aids payable in 2010 and thereafter, the total aid for any city shall not exceed the sum of
(1) ten percent of the city's net levy for the year prior to the aid distribution plus (2) its total aid in
the previous year. For aids payable in 2009 and thereafter, the total aid for any city with a population
of 2,500 or more may not be less than its total aid under this section in the previous year minus the
lesser of $10 multiplied by its population, or ten percent of its net levy in the year prior to the aid
distribution.
    (d) For aids payable in 2010 and thereafter, the total aid for a city with a population less than
2,500 must not be less than the amount it was certified to receive in the previous year minus the
lesser of $10 multiplied by its population, or five percent of its 2003 certified aid amount. For aids

    (e) A city's aid loss under this section may not exceed $300,000 in any year in which the total city
aid appropriation under section 477A.03, subdivision 2a, is equal or greater than the appropriation
under that subdivision in the previous year, unless the city has an adjustment in its city net tax
capacity under the process described in section 469.174, subdivision 28.
    (f) If a city's net tax capacity used in calculating aid under this section has decreased in any year
by more than 25 percent from its net tax capacity in the previous year due to property becoming
tax-exempt Indian land, the city's maximum allowed aid increase under paragraph (c) shall be
increased by an amount equal to (1) the city's tax rate in the year of the aid calculation, multiplied
by (2) the amount of its net tax capacity decrease resulting from the property becoming tax exempt.
    (g) In calendar year 2012 and thereafter, the aid that would otherwise be distributed to a city
under paragraphs (a) to (f) will be reduced or eliminated if the city is subject to an aid offset under
section 297A.99, subdivision 14.

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2012 and thereafter.
    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.13, subdivision 23, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23. Class 2. (a) An agricultural homestead consists of class 2a agricultural land that is
homesteaded, along with any class 2b rural vacant land that is contiguous to the class 2a land under
the same ownership. The market value of the house and garage and immediately surrounding one
acre of land has the same class rates as class 1a or 1b property under subdivision 22. The value of the
remaining land including improvements up to the first tier valuation limit of agricultural homestead
property has a net class rate of 0.5 percent of market value. The remaining property over the first
tier has a class rate of one percent of market value. For purposes of this subdivision, the "first tier
valuation limit of agricultural homestead property" and "first tier" means the limit certified under
section 273.11, subdivision 23.
    (b) Class 2a agricultural land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
agricultural land and buildings. Class 2a property has a net class rate of one percent of market
value, unless it is part of an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a). Class 2a property must
also include any property that would otherwise be classified as 2b, but is interspersed with class
2a property, including but not limited to sloughs, wooded wind shelters, acreage abutting ditches,
ravines, rock piles, land subject to a setback requirement, and other similar land that is impractical
for the assessor to value separately from the rest of the property or that is unlikely to be able to
be sold separately from the rest of the property.
    An assessor may classify the part of a parcel described in this subdivision that is used for
agricultural purposes as class 2a and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use.
    (c) Class 2b rural vacant land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
unplatted real estate, rural in character and not used for agricultural purposes, including land
used for growing trees for timber, lumber, and wood and wood products, that is not improved
with a structure. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
Any parcel of 20 acres or more improved with a structure that is not a minor, ancillary nonresidential
structure must be split-classified, and ten acres must be assigned to the split parcel containing the
structure. Class 2b property has a net class rate of one percent of market value unless it is part of
an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a), or qualifies as class 2c under paragraph (d).
     (d) Class 2c managed forest land consists of no less than 20 and no more than 1,920 acres
statewide per taxpayer that is being managed under a forest management plan ­h                          t­­

apply to the assessor in order for the property to initially qualify for the reduced rate and provide
the information required by the assessor to verify that the property qualifies for the reduced rate.
If the assessor receives the application and information before May 1 in an assessment year, the
property qualifies beginning with that assessment year. If the assessor receives the application
and information after April 30 in an assessment year, the property may not qualify until the next
assessment year. The commissioner of natural resources must concur that the land is qualified. The
commissioner of natural resources shall annually provide county assessors verification information
on a timely basis. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
972                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [32ND DAY

For purposes of this paragraph, a "forest management plan" means a written document providing
a framework for site-specific healthy, productive, and sustainable forest resources. A forest
management plan must include at least the following: (i) forest management goals for the land;
(ii) a reliable field inventory of the individual forest cover types, their age, and density; (iii) a
description of the soil type and quality; (iv) an aerial photo and/or map of the vegetation and other
natural features of the land clearly indicating the boundaries of the land and of the forest land; (v)
the proposed future conditions of the land; (vi) prescriptions to meet proposed future conditions
of the land; (vii) a recommended timetable for implementing the prescribed activities; and (viii)
a legal description of the land encompassing the parcels included in the plan. All management
activities prescribed in a plan must be in accordance with the recommended timber harvesting and
forest management guidelines. The commissioner of natural resources shall provide a framework
for plan content and updating and revising plans.
    (e) Agricultural land as used in this section means contiguous acreage of ten acres or more, used
during the preceding year for agricultural purposes. "Agricultural purposes" as used in this section
means the raising, cultivation, drying, or storage of agricultural products for sale, or the storage
of machinery or equipment used in support of agricultural production by the same farm entity.
For a property to be classified as agricultural based only on the drying or storage of agricultural
products, the products being dried or stored must have been produced by the same farm entity as the
entity operating the drying or storage facility. "Agricultural purposes" also includes enrollment in
the Reinvest in Minnesota program under sections 103F.501 to 103F.535 or the federal Conservation
Reserve Program as contained in Public Law 99-198 or a similar state or federal conservation
program if the property was classified as agricultural (i) under this subdivision for the assessment
year 2002 or (ii) in the year prior to its enrollment. Agricultural classification shall not be based
upon the market value of any residential structures on the parcel or contiguous parcels under the
same ownership.
    (f) Real estate of less than ten acres, which is exclusively or intensively used for raising or
cultivating agricultural products, shall be considered as agricultural land. To qualify under this
paragraph, property that includes a residential structure must be used intensively for one of the
following purposes:
    (i) for drying or storage of grain or storage of machinery or equipment used to support
agricultural activities on other parcels of property operated by the same farming entity;
    (ii) as a nursery, provided that only those acres used to produce nursery stock are considered
agricultural land;
   (iii) for livestock or poultry confinement, provided that land that is used only for pasturing and
grazing does not qualify; or
    (iv) for market farming; for purposes of this paragraph, "market farming" means the cultivation
of one or more fruits or vegetables or production of animal or other agricultural products for sale to
local markets by the farmer or an organization with which the farmer is affiliated.
   (g) Land shall be classified as agricultural even if all or a portion of the agricultural use of that
property is the leasing to, or use by another person for agricultural purposes.
   Classification under this subdivision is not determinative for qualifying under section 273.111.
32ND DAY]                          MONDAY, MARCH 28, 2011                                             973

    (h) The property classification under this section supersedes, for property tax purposes only, any
locally administered agricultural policies or land use restrictions that define minimum or maximum
farm acreage.
   (i) The term "agricultural products" as used in this subdivision includes production for sale of:
   (1) livestock, dairy animals, dairy products, poultry and poultry products, fur-bearing animals,
horticultural and nursery stock, fruit of all kinds, vegetables, forage, grains, bees, and apiary
products by the owner;
   (2) fish bred for sale and consumption if the fish breeding occurs on land zoned for agricultural
use;
    (3) the commercial boarding of horses, which may include related horse training and riding
instruction, if the boarding is done on property that is also used for raising pasture to graze horses
or raising or cultivating other agricultural products as defined in clause (1);
    (4) property which is owned and operated by nonprofit organizations used for equestrian
activities, excluding racing;
    (5) game birds and waterfowl bred and raised for use on a shooting preserve licensed under
section 97A.115;
   (6) insects primarily bred to be used as food for animals;
   (7) trees, grown for sale as a crop, including short rotation woody crops, and not sold for timber,
lumber, wood, or wood products; and
   (8) maple syrup taken from trees grown by a person licensed by the Minnesota Department of
Agriculture under chapter 28A as a food processor.
    (j) If a parcel used for agricultural purposes is also used for commercial or industrial purposes,
including but not limited to:
   (1) wholesale and retail sales;
   (2) processing of raw agricultural products or other goods;
   (3) warehousing or storage of processed goods; and
   (4) office facilities for the support of the activities enumerated in clauses (1), (2), and (3),
the assessor shall classify the part of the parcel used for agricultural purposes as class 1b, 2a, or 2b,
whichever is appropriate, and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use. The grading, sorting,
and packaging of raw agricultural products for first sale is considered an agricultural purpose. A
greenhouse or other building where horticultural or nursery products are grown that is also used for
the conduct of retail sales must be classified as agricultural if it is primarily used for the growing
of horticultural or nursery products from seed, cuttings, or roots and occasionally as a showroom
for the retail sale of those products. Use of a greenhouse or building only for the display of already
grown horticultural or nursery products does not qualify as an agricultural purpose.
   (k) The assessor shall determine and list separately on the records the market value of the
homestead dwelling and the one acre of land on which that dwelling is located. If any farm
974                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [32ND DAY

buildings or structures are located on this homesteaded acre of land, their market value shall not be
included in this separate determination.
    (l) Class 2d airport landing area consists of a landing area or public access area of a privately
owned public use airport. It has a class rate of one percent of market value. To qualify for
classification under this paragraph, a privately owned public use airport must be licensed as a
public airport under section 360.018. For purposes of this paragraph, "landing area" means that part
of a privately owned public use airport properly cleared, regularly maintained, and made available
to the public for use by aircraft and includes runways, taxiways, aprons, and sites upon which are
situated landing or navigational aids. A landing area also includes land underlying both the primary
surface and the approach surfaces that comply with all of the following:
    (i) the land is properly cleared and regularly maintained for the primary purposes of the landing,
taking off, and taxiing of aircraft; but that portion of the land that contains facilities for servicing,
repair, or maintenance of aircraft is not included as a landing area;
   (ii) the land is part of the airport property; and
   (iii) the land is not used for commercial or residential purposes.
The land contained in a landing area under this paragraph must be described and certified by the
commissioner of transportation. The certification is effective until it is modified, or until the airport
or landing area no longer meets the requirements of this paragraph. For purposes of this paragraph,
"public access area" means property used as an aircraft parking ramp, apron, or storage hangar, or
an arrival and departure building in connection with the airport.
    (m) Class 2e consists of land with a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively being
mined and is not otherwise classified as class 2a or 2b, provided that the land is not located in a county
that has elected to opt-out of the aggregate preservation program as provided in section 273.1115,
subdivision 6. It has a class rate of one percent of market value. To qualify for classification under
this paragraph, the property must be at least ten contiguous acres in size and the owner of the property
must record with the county recorder of the county in which the property is located an affidavit
containing:
   (1) a legal description of the property;
   (2) a disclosure that the property contains a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively
being mined but is present on the entire parcel enrolled;
   (3) documentation that the conditional use under the county or local zoning ordinance of this
property is for mining; and
    (4) documentation that a permit has been issued by the local unit of government or the mining
activity is allowed under local ordinance. The disclosure must include a statement from a registered
professional geologist, engineer, or soil scientist delineating the deposit and certifying that it is a
commercial aggregate deposit.
   For purposes of this section and section 273.1115, "commercial aggregate deposit" means a
deposit that will yield crushed stone or sand and gravel that is suitable for use as a construction
aggregate; and "actively mined" means the removal of top soil and overburden in preparation for
excavation or excavation of a commercial deposit.

    (n) When any portion of the property under this subdivision or subdivision 22 begins to be
actively mined, the owner must file a supplemental affidavit within 60 days from the day any

The acres actively being mined must be (1) valued and classified under subdivision 24 in the next
subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource preservation property
tax program under section 273.1115, if the land was enrolled in that program. Copies of the
original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed with the county assessor, the local
zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Land and Minerals.
A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent portion of the property is actively
mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres, even if the actual mining activity
constitutes less than five acres.
   (o) The definitions prescribed by the commissioner under paragraphs (c) and (d) are not rules
and are exempt from the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14, and the provisions in section 14.386
concerning exempt rules do not apply.

      Sec. 14. [275.761] MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT REQUIREMENTS REDUCED.
    (a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary and except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c), the
amounts required to be expended under the maintenance of effort requirements for counties under
sections 134.34, 245.4835, 256F.10, and 256F.13, are reduced to 90 percent of the amounts required
for 2011.
   (b) This section does not permit a county to reduce compliance with maintenance of effort
requirements to the extent that the reduction would:
      (1) require the state to expend additional money or incur additional costs; or
      (2) cause a reduction in the receipt by the state or the county of federal funds.
    (c) The commissioner of management and budget may determine the maintenance of effort
requirements that are not permitted, in whole or in part, to be reduced under paragraph (b). The
commissioner shall publish these determinations on the department's Web site and no county may
reduce compliance with a maintenance of effort requirement that the commissioner determines is
not subject to reduction.
    (d) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the amounts required to be expended under the
maintenance of effort requirements for all statutory and home rule charter cities under section 134.34
are reduced to 90 percent of the amounts required for 2011.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for maintenance of effort requirements in 2012
and 2013.
      Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 276.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Contents of tax statements. (a) The treasurer shall provide for the printing of the tax
statements. The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the property tax statement
and its contents. The tax statement must not state or imply that property tax credits are paid by the
state of Minnesota. The statement must contain a tabulated statement of the dollar amount due to
each taxing authority and the amount of the state tax from the parcel of real property for which a
particular tax statement is prepared. The dollar amounts attributable to the county, the state tax, the
voter approved school tax, the other local school tax, the township or municipality, and the total
of the metropolitan special taxing districts as defined in section 275.065, subdivision 3, paragraph
(i), must be separately stated. The amounts due all other special taxing districts, if any, may be
aggregated except that any levies made by the regional rail authorities in the county of Anoka,
Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, or Washington under chapter 398A shall be listed on a
separate line directly under the appropriate county's levy. If the county levy under this paragraph
includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581,

the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately stated from the remaining county levy
amount. In the case of Ramsey County, if the county levy under this paragraph includes an amount
for public library service under section 134.07, the amount attributable for that purpose may be
separated from the remaining county levy amount. The amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying
under the senior citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount
of property tax before subtraction of the deferred property tax amount. The amount of the tax on

The dollar amounts, including the dollar amount of any special assessments, may be rounded to the
nearest even whole dollar. For purposes of this section whole odd-numbered dollars may be adjusted

subdivision 16, if any, must also be listed on the tax statement.
   (b) The property tax statements for manufactured homes and sectional structures taxed as
personal property shall contain the same information that is required on the tax statements for real
property.
   (c) Real and personal property tax statements must contain the following information in the order
given in this paragraph. The information must contain the current year tax information in the right
column with the corresponding information for the previous year in a column on the left:
   (1) the property's estimated market value under section 273.11, subdivision 1;

    (d) If the county uses envelopes for mailing property tax statements and if the county agrees, a
taxing district may include a notice with the property tax statement notifying taxpayers when the
taxing district will begin its budget deliberations for the current year, and encouraging taxpayers
to attend the hearings. If the county allows notices to be included in the envelope containing the
property tax statement, and if more than one taxing district relative to a given property decides to
include a notice with the tax statement, the county treasurer or auditor must coordinate the process
and may combine the information on a single announcement.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2012 and thereafter.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.50, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. General right to refund. (a) Subject to the requirements of this section and
section 289A.40, a taxpayer who has paid a tax in excess of the taxes lawfully due and who files a
written claim for refund will be refunded or credited the overpayment of the tax determined by the
980                                      JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                            [32ND DAY

commissioner to be erroneously paid.
    (b) The claim must specify the name of the taxpayer, the date when and the period for which the
tax was paid, the kind of tax paid, the amount of the tax that the taxpayer claims was erroneously
paid, the grounds on which a refund is claimed, and other information relative to the payment and in
the form required by the commissioner. An income tax, estate tax, or corporate franchise tax return,
or amended return claiming an overpayment constitutes a claim for refund.
    (c) When, in the course of an examination, and within the time for requesting a refund, the
commissioner determines that there has been an overpayment of tax, the commissioner shall
refund or credit the overpayment to the taxpayer and no demand is necessary. If the overpayment
exceeds $1, the amount of the overpayment must be refunded to the taxpayer. If the amount of the
overpayment is less than $1, the commissioner is not required to refund. In these situations, the
commissioner does not have to make written findings or serve notice by mail to the taxpayer.
    (d) If the amount allowable as a credit for withholding, estimated taxes, or dependent care
exceeds the tax against which the credit is allowable, the amount of the excess is considered
an overpayment. T   ­h

              t­ The requirements of section 270C.33 do not apply to the refunding of such an
overpayment shown on the original return filed by a taxpayer.
   (e) If the entertainment tax withheld at the source exceeds by $1 or more the taxes, penalties,
and interest reported in the return of the entertainment entity or imposed by section 290.9201, the
excess must be refunded to the entertainment entity. If the excess is less than $1, the commissioner
need not refund that amount.
    (f) If the surety deposit required for a construction contract exceeds the liability of the
out-of-state contractor, the commissioner shall refund the difference to the contractor.
   (g) An action of the commissioner in refunding the amount of the overpayment does not
constitute a determination of the correctness of the return of the taxpayer.
   (h) There is appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of revenue the amount
necessary to pay refunds allowed under this section.

Minnesota homestead in the calendar year, and which rent constitutes the basis, in the succeeding
calendar year of a claim for relief under this chapter by the claimant.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for claims based on rent paid in 2010 and
following years.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290A.03, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
     Subd. 13. Property taxes payable. "Property taxes payable" means the property tax exclusive
of special assessments, penalties, and interest payable on a claimant's homestead after deductions
made under sections 273.135, 273.1384, 273.1391, 273.42, subdivision 2, and any other state paid
property tax credits in any calendar year, and after any refund claimed and allowable under section
290A.04, subdivision 2h, that is first payable in the year that the property tax is payable. In the case of
a claimant who makes ground lease payments, "property taxes payable" includes the amount of the
payments directly attributable to the property taxes assessed against the parcel on which the house
is located. No apportionment or reduction of the "property taxes payable" shall be required for the
use of a portion of the claimant's homestead for a business purpose if the claimant does not deduct
any business depreciation expenses for the use of a portion of the homestead in the determination of
federal adjusted gross income. For homesteads which are manufactured homes as defined in section
273.125, subdivision 8, and for homesteads which are park trailers taxed as manufactured homes
under section 168.012, subdivision 9, "property taxes payable" shall also include ­        1­9 15 percent
of the gross rent paid in the preceding year for the site on which the homestead is located. When a
homestead is owned by two or more persons as joint tenants or tenants in common, such tenants shall
determine between them which tenant may claim the property taxes payable on the homestead. If
they are unable to agree, the matter shall be referred to the commissioner of revenue whose decision
shall be final. Property taxes are considered payable in the year prescribed by law for payment of
the taxes.
    In the case of a claim relating to "property taxes payable," the claimant must have owned and
occupied the homestead on January 2 of the year in which the tax is payable and (i) the property must
have been classified as homestead property pursuant to section 273.124, on or before December 15
of the assessment year to which the "property taxes payable" relate; or (ii) the claimant must provide
documentation from the local assessor that application for homestead classification has been made
on or before December 15 of the year in which the "property taxes payable" were payable and that
the assessor has approved the application.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for claims based on rent paid in 2010 and
following years.
   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290A.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Homeowners. A claimant whose property taxes payable are in excess of the percentage
of the household income stated below shall pay an amount equal to the percent of income shown
for the appropriate household income level along with the percent to be paid by the claimant of the
remaining amount of property taxes payable. The state refund equals the amount of property taxes
payable that remain, up to the state refund amount shown below.

lesser of $10 multiplied by its population, or ten percent of its net levy in the year prior to the aid
distribution.
    (d) For aids payable in 2010 and thereafter, the total aid for a city with a population less than
2,500 must not be less than the amount it was certified to receive in the previous year minus the
lesser of $10 multiplied by its population, or five percent of its 2003 certified aid amount. For aids
payable in 2009 only, the total aid for a city with a population less than 2,500 must not be less than
what it received under this section in the previous year unless its total aid in calendar year 2008 was
aid under section 477A.011, subdivision 36, paragraph (s), in which case its minimum aid is zero.
    (e) A city's aid loss under this section may not exceed $300,000 in any year in which the total city
aid appropriation under section 477A.03, subdivision 2a, is equal or greater than the appropriation
under that subdivision in the previous year, unless the city has an adjustment in its city net tax
capacity under the process described in section 469.174, subdivision 28.
    (f) If a city's net tax capacity used in calculating aid under this section has decreased in any year
by more than 25 percent from its net tax capacity in the previous year due to property becoming
tax-exempt Indian land, the city's maximum allowed aid increase under paragraph (c) shall be
increased by an amount equal to (1) the city's tax rate in the year of the aid calculation, multiplied
by (2) the amount of its net tax capacity decrease resulting from the property becoming tax exempt.

    Subd. 11. Aid payments in 2011 and 2012. Notwithstanding aids calculated or certified for
2011 under subdivision 9, for 2011 and 2012, each city shall receive an aid distribution under this
section equal to the lesser of (1) the total amount of aid it received under this section in 2010 after
the reductions under sections 477A.0133 and 477A.0134, and reduced by the amount of payments
made under section 477A.011, subdivision 36, paragraphs (y) and (z), or (2) the amount it was
certified to receive in 2011 under subdivision 9. In 2011 only, a city that qualifies for the aid base
adjustment under section 477A.011, subdivision 36, paragraph (aa), shall receive the amount that
it was certified to receive in 2011. In 2012, a city that qualifies for the aid base adjustment under
section 477A.011, subdivision 36, paragraph (aa), shall receive the amount that it was certified to
receive in 2011, minus the aid base adjustment provided under section 477A.011, subdivision 36,
paragraph (aa).

is withdrawn or no longer qualifies. The application must be filed with the assessor of the taxing
district in which the real property is located on the form prescribed by the commissioner of revenue.
Each application must include the most recent available aerial photograph or satellite image of the
property provided by the Farm Service Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture
that clearly delineates the land that is to be enrolled. The application form must contain a statement
setting forth the consequences to the property owner of termination of qualification of property under
the rural preserve program, together with a recommendation that land that is likely to be changed to
a nonqualifying use during the period of enrollment should not be included in the application. The
assessor may require proof by affidavit or otherwise that the property qualifies under subdivision 2.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.13, subdivision 25, is amended to read:
    Subd. 25. Class 4. (a) Class 4a is residential real estate containing four or more units and used or
held for use by the owner or by the tenants or lessees of the owner as a residence for rental periods
of 30 days or more, excluding property qualifying for class 4d. Class 4a also includes hospitals
licensed under sections 144.50 to 144.56, other than hospitals exempt under section 272.02, and
contiguous property used for hospital purposes, without regard to whether the property has been
platted or subdivided. The market value of class 4a property has a class rate of 1.25 percent.
   (b) Class 4b includes:
   (1) residential real estate containing less than four units that does not qualify as class 4bb, other
than seasonal residential recreational property;
   (2) manufactured homes not classified under any other provision;
   (3) a dwelling, garage, and surrounding one acre of property on a nonhomestead farm classified
under subdivision 23, paragraph (b) containing two or three units; and
   (4) unimproved property that is classified residential as determined under subdivision 33.
   The market value of class 4b property has a class rate of 1.25 percent.
   (c) Class 4bb includes:
    (1) nonhomestead residential real estate containing one unit, other than seasonal residential
recreational property; and
   (2) a single family dwelling, garage, and surrounding one acre of property on a nonhomestead
farm classified under subdivision 23, paragraph (b).
   Class 4bb property has the same class rates as class 1a property under subdivision 22.
    Property that has been classified as seasonal residential recreational property at any time during
which it has been owned by the current owner or spouse of the current owner does not qualify for
class 4bb.
   (d) Class 4c property includes:
    (1) except as provided in subdivision 22, paragraph (c), real and personal property devoted to
temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes, including real and personal
property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes and
not devoted to commercial purposes for more than 250 days in the year preceding the year of
assessment. For purposes of this clause, property is devoted to a commercial purpose on a specific
day if any portion of the property is used for residential occupancy, and a fee is charged for

residential occupancy. Class 4c property under this clause must contain three or more rental units.
A "rental unit" is defined as a cabin, condominium, townhouse, sleeping room, or individual
camping site equipped with water and electrical hookups for recreational vehicles. Class 4c
property under this clause must provide recreational activities such as renting ice fishing houses,
boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski equipment; provide marina services,
launch services, or guide services; or sell bait and fishing tackle. A camping pad offered for
rent by a property that otherwise qualifies for class 4c under this clause is also class 4c under
this clause regardless of the term of the rental agreement, as long as the use of the camping pad
does not exceed 250 days. In order for a property to be classified as class 4c, seasonal residential
recreational for commercial purposes under this clause, at least 40 percent of the annual gross
lodging receipts related to the property must be from business conducted during 90 consecutive
days and either (i) at least 60 percent of all paid bookings by lodging guests during the year must
be for periods of at least two consecutive nights; or (ii) at least 20 percent of the annual gross
receipts must be from charges for rental of fish houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill
or cross-country ski equipment, or charges for marina services, launch services, and guide services,
or the sale of bait and fishing tackle. For purposes of this determination, a paid booking of five or
more nights shall be counted as two bookings. Class 4c property classified under this clause also
includes commercial use real property used exclusively for recreational purposes in conjunction
with other class 4c property classified under this clause and devoted to temporary and seasonal
residential occupancy for recreational purposes, up to a total of two acres, provided the property
is not devoted to commercial recreational use for more than 250 days in the year preceding the
year of assessment and is located within two miles of the class 4c property with which it is used.
Owners of real and personal property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for
recreation purposes and all or a portion of which was devoted to commercial purposes for not more
than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment desiring classification as class 4c, must
submit a declaration to the assessor designating the cabins or units occupied for 250 days or less in
the year preceding the year of assessment by January 15 of the assessment year. Those cabins or
units and a proportionate share of the land on which they are located must be designated class 4c
under this clause as otherwise provided. The remainder of the cabins or units and a proportionate
share of the land on which they are located will be designated as class 3a. The owner of property
desiring designation as class 4c property under this clause must provide guest registers or other
records demonstrating that the units for which class 4c designation is sought were not occupied for
more than 250 days in the year preceding the assessment if so requested. The portion of a property
operated as a (1) restaurant, (2) bar, (3) gift shop, (4) conference center or meeting room, and (5)
other nonresidential facility operated on a commercial basis not directly related to temporary and
seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes does not qualify for class 4c;
   (2) qualified property used as a golf course if:
   (i) it is open to the public on a daily fee basis. It may charge membership fees or dues, but a
membership fee may not be required in order to use the property for golfing, and its green fees for
golfing must be comparable to green fees typically charged by municipal courses; and
   (ii) it meets the requirements of section 273.112, subdivision 3, paragraph (d).
   A structure used as a clubhouse, restaurant, or place of refreshment in conjunction with the golf
course is classified as class 3a property;
   (3) real property up to a maximum of three acres of land owned and used by a nonprofit

classification. Buildings used in conjunction with a marina for marina services, including but not
limited to buildings used to provide food and beverage services, fuel, boat repairs, or the sale of bait
or fishing tackle, are classified as class 3a property.

Housing Finance Agency under section 273.128, subdivision 3. If only a portion of the units in the
building qualify as low-income rental housing units as certified under section 273.128, subdivision
3, only the proportion of qualifying units to the total number of units in the building qualify for class
4d. The remaining portion of the building shall be classified by the assessor based upon its use. Class
4d also includes the same proportion of land as the qualifying low-income rental housing units are to
the total units in the building. For all properties qualifying as class 4d, the market value determined
by the assessor must be based on the normal approach to value using normal unrestricted rents.
   Class 4d property has a class rate of 0.75 percent.

under subdivision 22 or 23 is excluded in determining the property's taxable market value if it serves
as the homestead of a military veteran, as defined in section 197.447, who has a service-connected

such time as the spouse sells, transfers, remarries, or otherwise disposes of the property, whichever
comes first. To qualify for the exemption under this paragraph, the surviving spouse must apply
annually to the assessor by July 1 of the assessment year.
   (d) In the case of an agricultural homestead, only the portion of the property consisting of the
house and garage and immediately surrounding one acre of land qualifies for the valuation exclusion
under this subdivision.
   (e) A property qualifying for a valuation exclusion under this subdivision is not eligible for the
credit under section 273.1384, subdivision 1, or classification under subdivision 22, paragraph (b).
    (f) To qualify for a valuation exclusion under this subdivision a property owner must apply to
the assessor by July 1 of each assessment year, except that an annual reapplication is not required
once a property has been accepted for a valuation exclusion under paragraph (b), clause (2), and the
property continues to qualify until there is a change in ownership.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2010, payable in 2011, and
thereafter, and applies to homesteads that initially qualified for the exclusion for taxes payable in
2009 and thereafter.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 274.01, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Ordinary board; meetings, deadlines, grievances. (a) The town board of a
town, or the council or other governing body of a city, is the board of appeal and equalization except
(1) in cities whose charters provide for a board of equalization or (2) in any city or town that has
transferred its local board of review power and duties to the county board as provided in subdivision
3. The county assessor shall fix a day and time when the board or the board of equalization shall meet
in the assessment districts of the county. Notwithstanding any law or city charter to the contrary, a
city board of equalization shall be referred to as a board of appeal and equalization. On or before
February 15 of each year the assessor shall give written notice of the time to the city or town clerk.
Notwithstanding the provisions of any charter to the contrary, the meetings must be held between
April 1 and May 31 each year, provided that the board may review appeals of denials of green acres
treatment as provided in paragraph (h) at any time. The clerk shall give published and posted notice
of the meeting at least ten days before the date of the meeting.
32ND DAY]                          MONDAY, MARCH 28, 2011                                            999

    The board shall meet at the office of the clerk to review the assessment and classification of
property in the town or city. No changes in valuation or classification which are intended to correct
errors in judgment by the county assessor may be made by the county assessor after the board
has adjourned in those cities or towns that hold a local board of review; however, corrections of
errors that are merely clerical in nature or changes that extend homestead treatment to property are
permitted after adjournment until the tax extension date for that assessment year. The changes must
be fully documented and maintained in the assessor's office and must be available for review by
any person. A copy of the changes made during this period in those cities or towns that hold a local
board of review must be sent to the county board no later than December 31 of the assessment year.
    (b) The board shall determine whether the taxable property in the town or city has been properly
placed on the list and properly valued by the assessor. If real or personal property has been omitted,
the board shall place it on the list with its market value, and correct the assessment so that each
tract or lot of real property, and each article, parcel, or class of personal property, is entered on the
assessment list at its market value. No assessment of the property of any person may be raised unless
the person has been duly notified of the intent of the board to do so. On application of any person
feeling aggrieved, the board shall review the assessment or classification, or both, and correct it as
appears just. The board may not make an individual market value adjustment or classification change
that would benefit the property if the owner or other person having control over the property has
refused the assessor access to inspect the property and the interior of any buildings or structures as
provided in section 273.20. A board member shall not participate in any actions of the board which
result in market value adjustments or classification changes to property owned by the board member,
the spouse, parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, uncle, aunt,
nephew, or niece of a board member, or property in which a board member has a financial interest.
The relationship may be by blood or marriage.
     (c) A local board may reduce assessments upon petition of the taxpayer but the total reductions
must not reduce the aggregate assessment made by the county assessor by more than one percent.
If the total reductions would lower the aggregate assessments made by the county assessor by more
than one percent, none of the adjustments may be made. The assessor shall correct any clerical errors
or double assessments discovered by the board without regard to the one percent limitation.
   (d) A local board does not have authority to grant an exemption or to order property removed
from the tax rolls.
    (e) A majority of the members may act at the meeting, and adjourn from day to day until they
finish hearing the cases presented. The assessor shall attend, with the assessment books and papers,
and take part in the proceedings, but must not vote. The county assessor, or an assistant delegated
by the county assessor shall attend the meetings. The board shall list separately, on a form appended
to the assessment book, all omitted property added to the list by the board and all items of property
increased or decreased, with the market value of each item of property, added or changed by the
board, placed opposite the item. The county assessor shall enter all changes made by the board in
the assessment book.
    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 3, if a person fails to appear in person, by counsel, or by
written communication before the board after being duly notified of the board's intent to raise the
assessment of the property, or if a person feeling aggrieved by an assessment or classification fails to
apply for a review of the assessment or classification, the person may not appear before the county
board of appeal and equalization for a review of the assessment or classification. This paragraph

does not apply if an assessment was made after the local board meeting, as provided in section
273.01, or if the person can establish not having received notice of market value at least five days
before the local board meeting.
    (g) The local board must complete its work and adjourn within 20 days from the time of
convening stated in the notice of the clerk, unless a longer period is approved by the commissioner
of revenue. No action taken after that date is valid. All complaints about an assessment or
classification made after the meeting of the board must be heard and determined by the county
board of equalization. A nonresident may, at any time, before the meeting of the board file written
objections to an assessment or classification with the county assessor. The objections must be

provided in this paragraph, the board must pass a resolution stating that it will do so, and must then
review all such appeals until it passes a subsequent resolution stating that it will not review such
appeals.

   The tax under this section is not treated as a local tax rate under section 469.177 and is not the
levy of a governmental unit under chapters 276A and 473F.
    The commissioner shall increase or decrease the preliminary or final rate for a year as necessary
to account for errors and tax base changes that affected a preliminary or final rate for either of the two
preceding years. Adjustments are allowed to the extent that the necessary information is available
to the commissioner at the time the rates for a year must be certified, and for the following reasons:
     (1) an erroneous report of taxable value by a local official;
     (2) an erroneous calculation by the commissioner; and
    (3) an increase or decrease in taxable value for commercial-industrial or seasonal residential
recreational property reported on the abstracts of tax lists submitted under section 275.29 that was
not reported on the abstracts of assessment submitted under section 270C.89 for the same year.
The commissioner may, but need not, make adjustments if the total difference in the tax levied for
the year would be less than $100,000.

     ­­) (c) The tax on taconite and iron sulphides shall be imposed on the average of the production
for the current year and the previous two years. The rate of the tax imposed will be the current year's
tax rate. This clause shall not apply in the case of the closing of a taconite facility if the property
taxes on the facility would be higher if this clause and section 298.25 were not applicable. The tax
on other iron-bearing material shall be imposed on the current year production.

      ) (e) Consistent with the intent of this subdivision to impose a tax based upon the weight
of merchantable iron ore concentrate, the commissioner of revenue may indirectly determine the
weight of merchantable iron ore concentrate included in fluxed pellets by subtracting the weight of
the limestone, dolomite, or olivine derivatives or other basic flux additives included in the pellets
from the weight of the pellets. For purposes of this paragraph, "fluxed pellets" are pellets produced
in a process in which limestone, dolomite, olivine, or other basic flux additives are combined with
merchantable iron ore concentrate. No subtraction from the weight of the pellets shall be allowed
for binders, mineral and chemical additives other than basic flux additives, or moisture.
    ­
    (g
     ­­) (f)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, for the first two years of a
plant's commercial production of direct reduced ore from ore mined in this state, no tax is imposed
under this section. As used in this paragraph, "commercial production" is production of more
than 50,000 tons of direct reduced ore in the current year or in any prior year, "noncommercial
production" is production of 50,000 tons or less of direct reduced ore in any year, and "direct
reduced ore" is ore that results in a product that has an iron content of at least 75 percent. For the
third year of a plant's commercial production of direct reduced ore, the rate to be applied to direct
reduced ore is 25 percent of the rate otherwise determined under this subdivision. For the fourth
commercial production year, the rate is 50 percent of the rate otherwise determined under this
subdivision; for the fifth commercial production year, the rate is 75 percent of the rate otherwise
determined under this subdivision; and for all subsequent commercial production years, the full
rate is imposed.
    (2) Subject to clause (1), production of direct reduced ore in this state is subject to the tax imposed
by this section, but if that production is not produced by a producer of taconite, iron sulfides, or other
iron-bearing material, the production of taconite, iron sulfides, or other iron-bearing material, that
is consumed in the production of direct reduced iron in this state is not subject to the tax imposed
by this section on taconite, iron sulfides, or other iron-bearing material.
    (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, no tax is imposed on direct reduced
ore under this section during the facility's noncommercial production of direct reduced ore. The

taconite or iron sulphides consumed in the noncommercial production of direct reduced ore is subject
to the tax imposed by this section on taconite and iron sulphides. Three-year average production of
direct reduced ore does not include production of direct reduced ore in any noncommercial year.
Three-year average production for a direct reduced ore facility that has noncommercial production is
the average of the commercial production of direct reduced ore for the current year and the previous
two commercial years.
   (4) This paragraph applies only to plants for which all environmental permits have been obtained
and construction has begun before July 1, 2008.

distributed as provided in section 298.282.
    (b) An amount must be allocated to towns or cities that is annually certified by the county auditor
of a county containing a taconite tax relief area as defined in section 273.134, paragraph (b), within
which there is (1) an organized township if, as of January 2, 1982, more than 75 percent of the
assessed valuation of the township consists of iron ore or (2) a city if, as of January 2, 1980, more
than 75 percent of the assessed valuation of the city consists of iron ore.
    (c) The amount allocated under paragraph (b) will be the portion of a township's or city's certified
levy equal to the proportion of (1) the difference between 50 percent of January 2, 1982, assessed
value in the case of a township and 50 percent of the January 2, 1980, assessed value in the case of
a city and its current assessed value to (2) the sum of its current assessed value plus the difference
determined in (1), provided that the amount distributed shall not exceed $55 per capita in the case
of a township or $75 per capita in the case of a city. For purposes of this limitation, population
will be determined according to the 1980 decennial census conducted by the United States Bureau
of the Census. If the current assessed value of the township exceeds 50 percent of the township's
January 2, 1982, assessed value, or if the current assessed value of the city exceeds 50 percent of the
city's January 2, 1980, assessed value, this paragraph shall not apply. For purposes of this paragraph,
"assessed value," when used in reference to years other than 1980 or 1982, means the appropriate
net tax capacities multiplied by 10.2.

     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 270A.07, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Notification requirement. (a) Any claimant agency, seeking collection of a
debt through setoff against a refund due, shall submit to the commissioner information indicating
the amount of each debt and information identifying the debtor, as required by section 270A.04,
subdivision 3.
    (b) For each setoff of a debt against a refund due, the commissioner shall charge a fee of $15.
The proceeds of fees shall be allocated by depositing $4 of each $15 fee collected into a Department
of Revenue recapture revolving fund and depositing the remaining balance into the general fund.
The sums deposited into the revolving fund are appropriated to the commissioner for the purpose
of administering the Revenue Recapture Act.
