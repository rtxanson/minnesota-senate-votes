continued by law.
   Sec. 15. [3D.14] CONTINUATION BY LAW.
    During the regular session immediately before the sunset of a state agency or an advisory
committee that is subject to this chapter, the legislature may enact legislation to continue the
agency or advisory committee for a period not to exceed 12 years. This chapter does not prohibit
the legislature from:
    (1) terminating a state agency or advisory committee subject to this chapter at a date earlier than
that provided in this chapter; or
    (2) considering any other legislation relative to a state agency or advisory committee subject to
this chapter.
   Sec. 16. [3D.15] PROCEDURE AFTER TERMINATION.
   Subdivision 1. Termination. Unless otherwise provided by law:
   (1) if after sunset review a state agency is abolished, the agency may continue in existence until
June 30 of the following year to conclude its business;
   (2) abolishment does not reduce or otherwise limit the powers and authority of the state agency
during the concluding year;
    (3) a state agency is terminated and shall cease all activities at the expiration of the one-year
period; and
    (4) all rules that have been adopted by the state agency expire at the expiration of the one-year
period.
   Subd. 2. Funds of abolished agency or advisory committee. (a) Any unobligated and
unexpended appropriations of an abolished agency or advisory committee lapse on June 30 of the
year after abolishment.
59TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                       2233

     (b) Except as provided by subdivision 4 or as otherwise provided by law, all money in a dedicated
fund of an abolished state agency or advisory committee on June 30 of the year after abolishment
is transferred to the general fund. The part of the law dedicating the money to a specific fund of an
abolished agency becomes void on June 30 of the year after abolishment.
   Subd. 3. Property and records of abolished agency or advisory committee. Unless the
governor designates an appropriate state agency as prescribed by subdivision 4, property and
records in the custody of an abolished state agency or advisory committee on June 30 of the
year after abolishment must be transferred to the commissioner of administration. If the governor
designates an appropriate state agency, the property and records must be transferred to the
designated state agency.
    Subd. 4. Continuing obligations. (a) The legislature recognizes the state's continuing
obligation to pay bonded indebtedness and all other obligations, including lease, contract, and
other written obligations, incurred by a state agency or advisory committee abolished under this
chapter, and this chapter does not impair or impede the payment of bonded indebtedness and all
other obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations, in accordance with their
terms. If an abolished state agency or advisory committee has outstanding bonded indebtedness or
other outstanding obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations, the bonds
and all other obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations, remain valid and
enforceable in accordance with their terms and subject to all applicable terms and conditions of the
laws and proceedings authorizing the bonds and all other obligations, including lease, contract, and
other written obligations.
    (b) The governor shall designate an appropriate state agency that shall continue to carry out all
covenants contained in the bonds and in all other obligations, including lease, contract, and other
written obligations, and the proceedings authorizing them, including the issuance of bonds, and
the performance of all other obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations,
to complete the construction of projects or the performance of other obligations, including lease,
contract, and other written obligations.
    (c) The designated state agency shall provide payment from the sources of payment of the bonds
in accordance with the terms of the bonds and shall provide payment from the sources of payment
of all other obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations, in accordance with
their terms, whether from taxes, revenues, or otherwise, until the bonds and interest on the bonds
are paid in full and all other obligations, including lease, contract, and other written obligations,
are performed and paid in full. If the proceedings so provide, all funds established by laws or
proceedings authorizing the bonds or authorizing other obligations, including lease, contract, and
other written obligations, must remain with the comptroller or the previously designated trustees.
If the proceedings do not provide that the funds remain with the comptroller or the previously
designated trustees, the funds must be transferred to the designated state agency.
   Sec. 17. [3D.16] ASSISTANCE OF AND ACCESS TO STATE AGENCIES.
    The commission may request the assistance of state agencies and officers. When assistance is
requested, a state agency or officer shall assist the commission. In carrying out its functions under
this chapter, the commission or its designated staff member may inspect the records, documents,
and files of any state agency.
   Sec. 18. [3D.17] RELOCATION OF EMPLOYEES.
2234                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [59TH DAY

    If an employee is displaced because a state agency or its advisory committee is abolished or
reorganized, the state agency shall make a reasonable effort to relocate the displaced employee.
   Sec. 19. [3D.18] SAVING PROVISION.
   Except as otherwise expressly provided, abolition of a state agency does not affect rights
and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, civil or criminal liabilities that arose, or
proceedings that were begun before the effective date of the abolition.
   Sec. 20. [3D.19] REVIEW OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION CREATING AN AGENCY.
    Each bill filed in a house of the legislature that would create a new state agency or a new advisory
committee to a state agency shall be reviewed by the commission. The commission shall review the
bill to determine if:
    (1) the proposed functions of the agency or committee could be administered by one or more
existing state agencies or advisory committees;
    (2) the form of regulation, if any, proposed by the bill is the least restrictive form of regulation
that will adequately protect the public;
    (3) the bill provides for adequate public input regarding any regulatory function proposed by the
bill; and
   (4) the bill provides for adequate protection against conflicts of interest within the agency or
committee.
   Sec. 21. [3D.20] GIFTS AND GRANTS.
    The commission may accept gifts, grants, and donations from any organization described in
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code for the purpose of funding any activity under this
chapter. All gifts, grants, and donations must be accepted in an open meeting by a majority of the
voting members of the commission and reported in the public record of the commission with the

   6.48 EXAMINATION OF COUNTIES; COST, FEES.
     (a) All the powers and duties conferred and imposed upon the state auditor shall be exercised
and performed by the state auditor in respect to the offices, institutions, public property, and
improvements of several counties of the state. At least once in each year, if funds and personnel
permit, the state auditor may visit, without previous notice, each county and make a thorough
examination of all accounts and records relating to the receipt and disbursement of the public
funds and the custody of the public funds and other property. If the audit is performed by a private
certified public accountant, the state auditor may require additional information from the private
certified public accountant as the state auditor deems in the public interest. The state auditor may
accept the audit or make additional examinations as the state auditor deems to be in the public
interest. The state auditor shall prescribe and install systems of accounts and financial reports that
shall be uniform, so far as practicable, for the same class of offices. A copy of the report of such
examination shall be filed and be subject to public inspection in the office of the state auditor
and another copy in the office of the auditor of the county thus examined. The state auditor may
accept the records and audit, or any part thereof, of the Department of Human Services in lieu of
examination of the county social welfare funds, if such audit has been made within any period
covered by the state auditor's audit of the other records of the county. If any such examination shall
disclose malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in any office of such county, such report shall
be filed with the county attorney of the county, and the county attorney shall institute such civil and
criminal proceedings as the law and the protection of the public interests shall require.

    (b) The county receiving any examination shall pay to the state general fund, notwithstanding
the provisions of section 16A.125, the total cost and expenses of such examinations, including the
salaries paid to the examiners while actually engaged in making such examination. The state auditor
on deeming it advisable may bill counties, having a population of 200,000 or over, monthly for
services rendered and the officials responsible for approving and paying claims shall cause said
bill to be promptly paid. The general fund shall be credited with all collections made for any such
examinations.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a county may provide for an audit to be performed by a
certified public accountant firm meeting the requirements of section 326A.05. A county must notify
the state auditor before August 1 of the even-numbered year immediately preceding the year in
which the county intends to have an audit performed by a certified public accounting firm. A county
currently using a certified public accounting firm must notify the state auditor before August 1 of
the even-numbered year immediately preceding the year in which the county intends for the state
auditor to audit the county. The audit performed under this paragraph must meet the standards and
be in the form required by the state auditor. The state auditor may require additional information
from the certified public accountant firm as the state auditor deems in the public interest, but the state
auditor must accept the audit unless the state auditor determines that it does not meet recognized
industry auditing standards or is not in the form required by the state auditor.

                        c­i
                       e­  ­n­ subdivision shall not be construed, however, as preventing any such

    Sec. 26. [15.062] EMPLOYEE COMPETITION FOR STATE BUSINESS.
59TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                      2237

   If an agency decides to seek an outside vendor to perform work currently done by state
employees, the agency must permit groups of state employees to compete for the business by
submitting responses to the agency's solicitation documents. Notwithstanding section 16A.127 or
any other law to the contrary, no statewide or agency indirect costs may be assessed to a group
of agency employees with respect to work performed under a contract awarded to a group of
employees under this section. This section supersedes any provision of law preventing a state
agency from entering into a contract with a state employee.
   Sec. 27. [15.76] SAVI PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Program established. The state agency value initiative (SAVI) program is
established to encourage state agencies to identify cost-effective and efficiency measures in agency
programs and operations that result in cost savings for the state. All state agencies, including
Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, may participate in this program.
    Subd. 2. Retained savings. (a) In order to encourage innovation and creative cost savings by
state employees, upon approval of the commissioner of management and budget, 50 percent of
any appropriations for agency operations that remain unspent at the end of a biennium because of
unanticipated innovation, efficiencies, or creative cost-savings may be carried forward and retained
by the agency to fund specific agency proposals or projects. Agencies choosing to spend retained
savings funds must ensure that project expenditures do not create future obligations beyond the
amounts available from the retained savings. The retained savings must be used only to fund projects
that directly support the agency's mission. This section does not restrict authority granted by other
law to carry forward money for a different period or for different purposes.
   (b) This section supersedes any contrary provision of section 16A.28.
    Subd. 3. Special peer review panel; review process. (a) Each participating agency must
organize a peer review panel that will determine which proposal or project receives funding from
the SAVI program. The peer review panel must be comprised of department employees who are
credited with cost-savings initiatives and department managers. The ratio between managers and
department employees must be balanced.
   (b) An agency may spend money for a project recommended for funding by the peer review
panel after:
    (1) the agency has posted notice of spending for the proposed project on the agency Web site
for at least 30 days; and
   (2) the commissioner of management and budget has approved spending money from the SAVI
account for the project.
    (c) Before approving a project, the commissioner of management and budget must submit
the request to the Legislative Advisory Commission for its review and recommendation. Upon
receiving a request from the commissioner, the Legislative Advisory Commission shall post
notice of the request on a legislative Web site for at least 30 days. Failure of the commission to
make a recommendation within this 30-day period is considered a negative recommendation. A
recommendation of the commission must be made at a meeting of the commission unless a written
recommendation is signed by all the members entitled to vote on the item.
   Subd. 4. SAVI-dedicated account. Each agency that participates in the SAVI program shall

have a SAVI-dedicated account in the special revenue fund, or other appropriate fund as determined
by the commissioner of management and budget, into which the agency's savings are deposited. The
agency will manage and review projects that are funded from this account. Money in the account is
appropriated to the participating agency for purposes authorized by this section.
   Subd. 5. Expiration. This section expires June 30, 2018.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective June 30, 2013, and first applies to funds to be
carried forward from the biennium ending June 30, 2013, to the biennium beginning July 1, 2013.
   Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 16A.10, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 1a. Purpose of performance data. Performance data shall be presented in the budget
proposal to:
   (1) provide information so that the legislature can determine the extent to which state programs
and activities are successful;
   (2) encourage agencies to develop clear and measurable goals and objectives for their programs
and activities; and
    (3) strengthen accountability to Minnesotans by providing a record of state government's
performance in providing effective and efficient services.
   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 16A.10, subdivision 1b, is amended to read:
   Subd. 1b. Performance data format. (a) As part of the budget proposal, agencies shall:
   (1) describe the goals and objectives of each agency program and activity; and
   (2) present performance data that measures the performance of programs and activities in

shall appropriately highlight agency performance issues that would assist legislative review and
decision making.
   (d) For purposes of this subdivision, subdivision 1a, and section 16A.106, the terms "program"
and "activity" are used in the same manner as the terms are used in state budgeting. However, the
commissioner may authorize an agency to define these terms in a different manner if that allows for
a more effective presentation of performance data.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 16A.10, subdivision 1c, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1c. Performance measures for change items. For each change item in the budget
proposal requesting new or increased funding, the budget document must present proposed
performance measures that can be used to determine if the new or increased funding is
accomplishing its goals. To the extent possible, each budget change item must identify relevant

     Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 16A.103, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Forecast parameters. The forecast must assume the continuation of current laws
and reasonable estimates of projected growth in the national and state economies and affected
populations. Revenue must be estimated for all sources provided for in current law. Expenditures
must be estimated for all obligations imposed by law and those projected to occur as a result of
variables outside the control of the legislature. Expenditures for the current biennium must be
based on actual appropriations or, for forecasted programs, the amount needed to fund the formula
in law. The base for expenditures projections for the next biennium is the amount appropriated
in the second year of the current biennium, except as provided by other law, or, for forecasted
programs, the amount needed to fund the formula in law. Expenditure estimates must not include
an allowance for inflation.
     Sec. 32. [16A.106] ZERO-BASED BUDGETING PRINCIPLES.
     (a) The detailed budget presented to the legislature must include:
    (1) a description of each budget activity for which the agency or entity receives an appropriation
in the current biennium or for which the agency or entity requests an appropriation in the next
biennium;
    (2) for each budget activity, three alternative funding levels or alternative ways of performing
the budget activity, at least one of which is less than the previous biennium's actual expenditures
for that budget activity, a summary of the priorities that would be accomplished within each level
compared to a zero budget, and the additional increments of value that would be added by the higher
funding levels compared to what would be accomplished if there were no funding for the activity;
and
    (3) for each budget activity, performance data as specified in section 16A.10, subdivision 1b, the
predicted effect of the three alternative funding levels on future performance, and also one or more
measures of cost efficiency and effectiveness of program delivery, which must include comparisons
to other states or entities with similar programs.
    (b) The commissioner's budget preparation guidelines and instructions must contain
requirements, deadlines, and technical assistance to facilitate implementation of this section. After
consultation with the legislative commission on planning and fiscal policy, the commissioner's
instructions may establish parameters for the three alternative funding levels required in paragraph
(a), clause (3).
    (c) The governor's recommendations must prioritize the budget activities within an agency or
program area. To the extent activities in more than one agency or program area are meeting the
same goals, the recommendations must prioritize budget activities across agencies or programs with
the same goals, and this prioritization must include agencies or programs not subject to zero-based
budgeting principles that biennium.
     (d) Expenditures for debt service under section 16A.641, subdivision 10, are not subject to

zero-based budgeting principles.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. (a) The zero-based budgeting principles in this section first apply to the
following budget proposals for the biennium beginning July 1, 2013:
    (1) legislative branch;
    (2) judicial branch;
    (3) Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system; and
   (4) approximately half of expenditure programs in the executive branch, designated by the
governor, in consultation with the chairs and lead minority members of the senate Finance
Committee and the house of representatives Ways and Means Committee.
   (b) The zero-based budgeting principles in this section apply to all budget proposals for the
biennium beginning July 1, 2015, and after.
    Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 16A.11, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. Part two: detailed budget. (a) Part two of the budget, the detailed budget estimates
both of expenditures and revenues, must contain any statements on the financial plan which the
governor believes desirable or which may be required by the legislature. The detailed estimates
shall include the governor's budget arranged in tabular form.
   (b) For programs designated for the zero-based budgeting principles under section 16A.106, the
budget must be prepared according to the requirements of that section.
     (c) For programs not designated for zero-based budgeting principles under section 16A.106,
tables listing expenditures for the next biennium must show the appropriation base for each year as
defined in section 16A.103, subdivision 1c. T         ­h

59TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                        2241

   Subd. 3. Lapse. Any portion of any appropriation not carried forward and remaining unexpended
and unencumbered at the close of a fiscal year lapses to the fund from which it was originally
appropriated. Except as provided in section 15.76, any appropriation amounts not carried forward
and remaining unexpended and unencumbered at the close of a biennium lapse to the fund from
which the appropriation was made.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective June 30, 2013.
   Sec. 35. [16A.90] EMPLOYEE GAINSHARING SYSTEM.
    The commissioner shall establish a program to provide onetime bonus compensation to state
employees for efforts made to reduce the costs of operating state government or for ways of
providing better or more efficient state services. The commissioner may make a onetime award to
an employee or group of employees whose suggestion or involvement in a project is determined by
the commissioner to have resulted in documented cost-savings to the state. The maximum award is
ten percent of the documented savings in the first fiscal year in which the savings are realized. The
award must be paid from the appropriation to which the savings accrued.
   Sec. 36. [16A.93] MINNESOTA PAY FOR PERFORMANCE ACT.
   Sections 16A.93 to 16A.96 may be cited as the "Minnesota Pay for Performance Act of 2011."
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 37. [16A.94] PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Pilot program established. The commissioner shall implement a pilot program
to demonstrate the feasibility and desirability of using state appropriation bonds to pay for certain
services based on performance and outcomes for the people served.
   Subd. 2. Oversight committee. (a) The commissioner shall appoint an oversight committee to:
   (1) identify criteria to select one or more services to be included in the pilot program;
    (2) identify the conditions of performance and desired outcomes for the people served by each
service selected;
   (3) identify criteria to evaluate whether a service has met the performance conditions; and
   (4) provide any other advice or assistance requested by the commissioner.
    (b) The oversight committee must include the commissioners of the Departments of Human
Services, Employment and Economic Development, and Administration, or their designees; a
representative of a nonprofit organization that has participated in a pay-for-performance program;
and any other person or organization that the commissioner determines would be of assistance in
developing and implementing the pilot program.
    Subd. 3. Contracts. The commissioner and the commissioner of the agency with a service to be
provided through the pilot program shall enter into a contract with the selected provider. The contract
must specify the service to be provided, the time frame in which it is to be provided, the outcome
required for payment, and any other terms deemed necessary or convenient for implementation of
the pilot program. The commissioner shall pay a provider that has met the terms and conditions
2242                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [59TH DAY

of a contract with money appropriated to the commissioner from the special appropriation bond
proceeds account established in section 16A.96. At a minimum, before the commissioner pays a
provider, the commissioner must determine that the state's return on investment is positive.
    Subd. 4. Return on investment calculation. The commissioner, in consultation with the
oversight committee, must establish the method and data required for calculating the state's return
on investment. The data at a minimum must include:
    (1) state income taxes and any other revenues collected in the year after the service was provided
that would not have been collected without the service; and
   (2) costs avoided by the state by providing the service.
   A positive return on investment for the state will cover the state's costs in financing and
administering the pilot program through documented increased state tax revenue or cost avoidance.
    Subd. 5. Report to governor and legislature. The commissioner must report to the governor
and legislative committees with jurisdiction over capital investment, finance, and ways and means,
and the services included in the pilot program, by January 15 of each year following a year in
which the pilot program is operating. The report must describe and discuss the criteria for selection
and evaluation of services to be provided through the program, the net benefits to the state of the
program, the state's return on investment, the cost of the services provided by other means in the
most recent past, the time frame for payment for the services, and the timing and costs for sale and
issuance of the bonds authorized in section 16A.96.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

APPROPRIATION BONDS.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. (a) The definitions in this subdivision apply to this section.
   (b) "Appropriation bond" means a bond, note, or other similar instrument of the state payable
during a biennium from one or more of the following sources:
   (1) money appropriated by law in any biennium for debt service due with respect to obligations
described in subdivision 2, paragraph (b);
   (2) proceeds of the sale of obligations described in subdivision 2, paragraph (b);
    (3) payments received for that purpose under agreements and ancillary arrangements described
in subdivision 2, paragraph (d); and
   (4) investment earnings on amounts in clauses (1) to (3).
    (c) "Debt service" means the amount payable in any biennium of principal, premium, if any, and
interest on appropriation bonds.
    Subd. 2. Authority. (a) Subject to the limitations of this subdivision, the commissioner of
management and budget may sell and issue appropriation bonds of the state under this section
for the purposes of the Minnesota pay for performance program established in sections 16A.93 to
16A.96. Proceeds of the bonds must be credited to a special appropriation bond proceeds account in
59TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                      2243

the state treasury. Net income from investment of the proceeds, as estimated by the commissioner,
must be credited to the special appropriation bond proceeds account.
    (b) Appropriation bonds may be sold and issued in amounts that, in the opinion of the
commissioner, are necessary to provide sufficient funds for achieving the purposes authorized
as provided under paragraph (a), and pay debt service, pay costs of issuance, make deposits to
reserve funds, pay the costs of credit enhancement, or make payments under other agreements
entered into under paragraph (d); provided, however, that bonds issued and unpaid shall not exceed
$20,000,000 in principal amount, excluding refunding bonds sold and issued under subdivision
4. During the biennium ending June 30, 2013, the commissioner may sell and issue bonds only
in an amount that the commissioner determines will result in principal and interest payments less
than the amount of savings to be generated through pay-for-performance contracts under section
16A.94. For programs achieving savings under a pay-for-performance contract, the commissioner
must reduce general fund appropriations by at least the amount of principal and interest payments
on bonds issued under this section.
   (c) Appropriation bonds may be issued in one or more series on the terms and conditions the
commissioner determines to be in the best interests of the state, but the term on any series of bonds
may not exceed 20 years.
    (d) At the time of, or in anticipation of, issuing the appropriation bonds, and at any time
thereafter, so long as the appropriation bonds are outstanding, the commissioner may enter
into agreements and ancillary arrangements relating to the appropriation bonds, including but
not limited to trust indentures, liquidity facilities, remarketing or dealer agreements, letter of
credit agreements, insurance policies, guaranty agreements, reimbursement agreements, indexing
agreements, or interest exchange agreements. Any payments made or received according to the
agreement or ancillary arrangement shall be made from or deposited as provided in the agreement
or ancillary arrangement. The determination of the commissioner included in an interest exchange
agreement that the agreement relates to an appropriation bond shall be conclusive.
    Subd. 3. Form; procedure. (a) Appropriation bonds may be issued in the form of bonds, notes,
or other similar instruments, and in the manner provided in section 16A.672. In the event that any
provision of section 16A.672 conflicts with this section, this section shall control.
    (b) Every appropriation bond shall include a conspicuous statement of the limitation established
in subdivision 6.
   (c) Appropriation bonds may be sold at either public or private sale upon such terms as the
commissioner shall determine are not inconsistent with this section and may be sold at any price or
percentage of par value. Any bid received may be rejected.
   (d) Appropriation bonds may bear interest at a fixed or variable rate.
    Subd. 4. Refunding bonds. The commissioner from time to time may issue appropriation bonds
for the purpose of refunding any appropriation bonds then outstanding, including the payment of any
redemption premiums on the bonds, any interest accrued or to accrue to the redemption date, and
costs related to the issuance and sale of the refunding bonds. The proceeds of any refunding bonds
may, in the discretion of the commissioner, be applied to the purchase or payment at maturity of the
appropriation bonds to be refunded, to the redemption of the outstanding bonds on any redemption
date, or to pay interest on the refunding bonds and may, pending application, be placed in escrow to
2244                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [59TH DAY

be applied to the purchase, payment, retirement, or redemption. Any escrowed proceeds, pending
such use, may be invested and reinvested in obligations that are authorized investments under section
11A.24. The income earned or realized on the investment may also be applied to the payment of
the bonds to be refunded or interest or premiums on the refunded bonds, or to pay interest on
the refunding bonds. After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied, any balance of the
proceeds and any investment income may be returned to the general fund or, if applicable, the
appropriation bond proceeds account for use in any lawful manner. All refunding bonds issued
under this subdivision must be prepared, executed, delivered, and secured by appropriations in the
same manner as the bonds to be refunded.
   Subd. 5. Appropriation bonds as legal investments. Any of the following entities may legally
invest any sinking funds, money, or other funds belonging to them or under their control in any
appropriation bonds issued under this section:
   (1) the state, the investment board, public officers, municipal corporations, political subdivisions,
and public bodies;
   (2) banks and bankers, savings and loan associations, credit unions, trust companies, savings
banks and institutions, investment companies, insurance companies, insurance associations, and
other persons carrying on a banking or insurance business; and
   (3) personal representatives, guardians, trustees, and other fiduciaries.
    Subd. 6. No full faith and credit; state not required to make appropriations. The
appropriation bonds are not public debt of the state, and the full faith, credit, and taxing powers of
the state are not pledged to the payment of the appropriation bonds or to any payment that the state
agrees to make under this section. Appropriation bonds shall not be obligations paid directly, in
whole or in part, from a tax of statewide application on any class of property, income, transaction,
or privilege. Appropriation bonds shall be payable in each fiscal year only from amounts that the
legislature may appropriate for debt service for any fiscal year, provided that nothing in this section
shall be construed to require the state to appropriate funds sufficient to make debt service payments
with respect to the bonds in any fiscal year.
    Subd. 7. Appropriation of proceeds. The proceeds of appropriation bonds and interest
credited to the special appropriation bond proceeds account are appropriated to the commissioner
for payment of contract obligations under the pay for performance program, as permitted by state
and federal law, and nonsalary expenses incurred in conjunction with the sale of the appropriation
bonds.
    Subd. 8. Appropriation for debt service. The amount needed to pay principal and interest on
appropriation bonds issued under this section is appropriated each year to the commissioner from
the general fund subject to the repeal, unallotment under section 16A.152, or cancellation otherwise
pursuant to subdivision 6.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

241.23 or to an agency's use of persons required by a court to provide:
    (1) community service; or
    (2) conservation or maintenance services on lands under the jurisdiction and control of the state.
    Sec. 44. [16D.18] RECIPROCAL AGREEMENT.
    (a) The commissioner is authorized to enter into agreements with the federal Department of
the Treasury that provide for offsetting state payments against federal nontax obligations. Except as
provided in paragraph (d), the commissioner may charge a fee of $20 per transaction for such offsets
and may collect this offset fee from the debtor by deducting it from the state payment. The agreement
may provide for offsetting federal payments, as authorized by federal law, against state tax and
nontax obligations, and collecting the offset cost from the debtor. The agreement shall provide that
the federal Department of the Treasury may deduct a fee from each administrative offset and state
payment offset. Setoffs to collect state and other entity obligations under chapters 16D, 270A, 270C,
and any other provision of Minnesota Statutes occur before a state payment offset. For purposes of
this paragraph "administrative offset" is any offset of federal payments to collect state debts and
"state payment offset" is any offset of state payments to collect federal nontax debts.
    (b) A debt is eligible for offset under this program if notice of intent to offset the debt is sent at
least 60 days prior to filing an offset claim or a shorter period of time, if required by federal law or an
agreement with the federal Department of the Treasury. When there is an agreement for scheduled
payments on an account, the debtor must be sent this notice each time an additional debt is claimed.
    (c) The debtor shall have the time period required for notice under paragraph (b) to contest
the offset. An agreement under this section must not allow for offset of payments if the debt that
would be subject to the offset is being contested or if the time for appealing the determination of
the debt has not yet expired. The treasury offset program agreement entered into by the state must
not require federal agencies to provide different due process than the requirements under Code of
Federal Regulations, title 31, section 285.6.
    (d) Notwithstanding the fee authorized under paragraph (a), if the commissioner enters into
a contingency fee agreement with a nonstate vendor to provide assistance under this section, the
commissioner may charge a debtor a fee for the processing of state payment offsets for the recovery
of federal nontax debts or the processing of federal payment offsets for the recovery of state tax and
nontax debt. The fee is a separate debt and may be withheld from any refund, reimbursement, or
other money held for the debtor. The fee may not exceed 15 percent of the original debt. Section
16A.1283 does not apply to fees charged under this paragraph.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment. As soon as
possible after that date, the commissioner must discuss an agreement authorized under this section
with appropriate federal officials, and if an agreement is entered into, the commissioner must begin
to implement it to collect debts owed to the state as soon as possible.

WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
   Subdivision 1. Agreement with Internal Revenue Service. Pursuant to section 270B.12, the
commissioner may enter into an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to identify taxpayers
who have refunds due from the department and liabilities owing to the Internal Revenue Service. In
accordance with the procedures established in the agreement, the Internal Revenue Service may levy
against the refunds to be paid by the department. For each refund levied upon, the commissioner
shall first deduct from the refund a fee of $20, and then remit the refund or the amount of the levy,
whichever is less, to the Internal Revenue Service. The proceeds of fees shall be deposited into the
Department of Revenue recapture revolving fund under section 270A.07, subdivision 1.
    Subd. 2. Reciprocal offset agreements. (a) The commissioner is authorized to enter into
agreements with the federal Department of the Treasury that provide for offsetting state payments
against federal nontax obligations. Except as provided in paragraph (d), the commissioner may
charge a fee of $20 per transaction for such offsets and may collect this offset fee from the debtor by
deducting it from the state payment. The agreement may provide for offsetting federal payments,
as authorized by federal law, against state tax and nontax obligations, and collecting the offset cost
from the debtor. The agreement shall provide that the federal Department of the Treasury may
deduct a fee from each administrative offset and state payment offset. Setoffs to collect state and
other entity obligations under chapters 16D, 270A, 270C, and any other provision of Minnesota
Statutes, occur before a state payment offset. For purposes of this paragraph "administrative offset"
is any offset of federal payments to collect state debts and "state payment offset" is any offset of
state payments to collect federal nontax debts.
59TH DAY]                              WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                                 2253

    (b) A debt is eligible for offset under this program if notice of intent to offset the debt is sent at
least 60 days prior to filing an offset claim or a shorter period of time, if required by federal law or an
agreement with the federal Department of the Treasury. When there is an agreement for scheduled
payments on an account, the debtor must be sent this notice each time an additional debt is claimed.
    (c) The debtor shall have the time period required for notice under paragraph (b) to contest
the offset. An agreement under this section must not allow for offset of payments if the debt that
would be subject to the offset is being contested or if the time for appealing the determination of
the debt has not yet expired. The treasury offset program agreement entered into by the state must
not require federal agencies to provide different due process than the requirements under Code of
Federal Regulations, title 31, section 285.6.
    (d) Notwithstanding the fee authorized under paragraph (a), if the commissioner enters into
a contingency fee agreement with a nonstate vendor to provide assistance under this section, the
commissioner may charge a debtor a fee for the processing of state payment offsets for the recovery
of federal nontax debts or the processing of federal payment offsets for the recovery of state tax and
nontax debt. The fee is a separate debt and may be withheld from any refund, reimbursement, or
other money held for the debtor. The fee may not exceed 15 percent of the original debt. Section
16A.1283 does not apply to fees charged under this paragraph.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment. As soon as
possible after that date, the commissioner must discuss an agreement authorized under this section
with appropriate federal officials, and if an agreement is entered into, the commissioner must begin
to implement it to collect debts owed to the state as soon as possible.
    Sec. 58. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 270C.545, is amended to read:

CLAIMS FOR OFFSET.

refund or the federal payment amounts remitted to the commissioner, then the unpaid debts of the
taxpayers whose refunds or federal payments are being offset to satisfy the debts are reduced only
by the actual amount of the refund payments or federal payments received by the commissioner.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a claim for the offset of a federal tax
refund must be submitted to the Department of the Treasury of the United States within ten years
after the date of the assessment of the tax owed by the taxpayer whose refund is to be offset to
satisfy the debt. For court debts referred to the commissioner under section 16D.04, subdivision 2,
paragraph (a), the federal refund offset fees are deducted as provided in this section, but the ten-year
time limit prescribed in this section for tax debts does not apply.

   Sec. 61. STATE BUILDING EFFICIENCY.
    Subdivision 1. Request for proposals. By July 1, 2011, the commissioner of administration
shall issue a request for proposals for a contract to provide recommendations for efficiencies in
state building management to the commissioner. The request for proposals shall require the vendor
to provide a system that will overlay existing building controls and instrumentation that influence
energy consumption, including space, equipment and system performance, facility operations, and
facility maintenance. The request for proposals shall require the vendor to provide a system that
provides concurrent building monitoring, energy consumption optimization, space utilization, and
equipment performance information.
    Subd. 2. Standards-based platform system with data analytics. The request for proposals
must require the vendor to provide: (1) a standards-based platform system with the capability to
integrate and coordinate a variety of control systems, including their data, and the ability to manage
all state buildings and their control systems; and (2) a system that uses data analytics to integrate
corrective action notification and work order management.
    Subd. 3. Proof of concept phase. The request for proposals shall require the selected vendor, at
no cost to the state, to begin work on the contract by implementing its proposed system on one to
three instrumented state buildings to demonstrate the savings provided by the system. The system
provided by the vendor must be capable of application to all instrumented state-owned buildings.
During this proof of concept phase, the vendor and the state must agree on how savings during the
full implementation phase will be defined, measured, and verified, to ensure that the contract will
provide the highest possible return on investment to the state.
    Subd. 4. Full implementation and payment. The request for proposal must require the state to
implement the system provided by the vendor in all instrumented buildings owned by the state if the
state and the vendor have agreed on how savings will be defined, measured, and verified, and the
work done under the requirements of subdivision 3 provides material savings to the state. After the
full implementation of the system provided by the vendor, the vendor shall be paid by the state from
the savings attributable to the work done by the vendor, according to the terms and performance
measures negotiated in the contract.
    Subd. 5. Selection of vendor. The commissioner of administration shall select a vendor from
the responses to the request for proposal by September 1, 2011.

   Subd. 6. Progress report. The commissioner shall provide a report describing the progress made
under this section to the governor and the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative
committees with jurisdiction over the commissioner of administration by January 15, 2012. The
report shall provide a dynamic scoring analysis of the work described in the report.
   Sec. 62. FLEET MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS.

  Sec. 2. [16E.0151] RESPONSIBILITY FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT.
   (a) The chief information officer is responsible for providing or entering into managed services
contracts for the provision of the following information technology systems and services to state
agencies:
      (1) state data centers;
      (2) mainframes including system software;
      (3) servers including system software;
      (4) desktops including system software;
      (5) laptop computers including system software;
      (6) a data network including system software;
      (7) database, electronic mail, office systems, reporting, and other standard software tools;
      (8) business application software and related technical support services;
      (9) help desk for the components listed in clauses (1) to (8);
      (10) maintenance, problem resolution, and break-fix for the components listed in clauses (1) to
59TH DAY]                             WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                       2263

(8);
       (11) regular upgrades and replacement for the components listed in clauses (1) to (8); and
       (12) network-connected output devices.
    (b) All state agency employees whose work primarily involves functions specified in paragraph
(a) are employees of the Office of Enterprise Technology. This includes employees who directly
perform the functions in paragraph (a), as well as employees whose work primarily involves
managing, supervising, or providing administrative services or support services to employees who
directly perform these functions. The chief information officer may assign employees of the office
to perform work exclusively for another state agency.
    (c) The chief information officer may allow a state agency to obtain services specified in
paragraph (a) through a contract with an outside vendor when the chief information officer and the
agency head agree that a contract would provide best value, as defined in section 16C.02, under
the service-level agreement. The chief information officer must require that agency contracts with
outside vendors ensure that systems and services are compatible with standards established by the
Office of Enterprise Technology.
    (d) In exercising authority under this section, the chief information officer must cooperate with
the commissioner of administration on contracts for acquisition of information technology systems
and services. The authority granted to the chief information officer does not limit the procurement,
contract management, and contract review authority of the commissioner of administration under
chapter 16C, including authority of the commissioner to enter into and manage cooperative
purchasing agreements with other states.
    (e) The Minnesota State Retirement System, the Public Employees Retirement Association,
the Teachers Retirement Association, the State Board of Investment, the Campaign Finance and
Public Disclosure Board, the State Lottery, and the Statewide Radio Board are not state agencies for
purposes of this section.
       Sec. 3. [16E.036] ADVISORY COMMITTEE.
    (a) The Technology Advisory Committee is created to advise the chief information officer. The
committee consists of six members appointed by the governor who are individuals actively involved
in business planning for state executive branch agencies, one county member designated by the
Association of Minnesota Counties, one member appointed by the governor as a representative of
a union that represents state information technology employees, and one member appointed by the
governor to represent private businesses.
   (b) Membership terms, removal of members, and filling of vacancies are as provided in section
15.059. Members do not receive compensation or reimbursement for expenses.
   (c) The committee shall select a chair from its members. The chief information officer shall
provide administrative support to the committee.
       (d) The committee shall advise the chief information officer on:
       (1) development and implementation of the state information technology strategic plan;
       (2) critical information technology initiatives for the state;

   (3) standards for state information architecture;
   (4) identification of business and technical needs of state agencies;
   (5) strategic information technology portfolio management, project prioritization, and
investment decisions;
   (6) the office's performance measures and fees for service agreements with executive branch
agencies;
   (7) management of the state enterprise technology revolving fund; and
   (8) the efficient and effective operation of the office.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 16E.14, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. Technology improvement account. The technology improvement account is
established as an account in the enterprise technology fund. Money in the account is appropriated
to the chief information officer for the purpose of funding a project that will result in improvements
in state information and telecommunications technology. The chief information officer may spend
money from the account on behalf of a state agency or group of agencies or may transfer money
in the account to a state agency or group of agencies only according to an agreement under which:
(1) the chief information officer has determined that savings generated by the project to be funded
from the account will exceed the cost of the project; and (2) the agency or agencies sponsoring the
project have developed a plan for recouping the project costs to the fund.
   Sec. 5. [16E.145] INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY APPROPRIATION.
    An appropriation for a state agency information and telecommunications technology project
must be made to the chief information officer. The chief information officer must manage and
disburse the appropriation on behalf of the sponsoring state agency. Any appropriation for an
information and telecommunications technology project made to a state agency other than the
Office of Enterprise Technology is transferred to the chief information officer.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2011, and applies to appropriations made
before or after that date. The remainder of any appropriation subject to this section made before July
1, 2011, is transferred to the chief information officer on July 1, 2011. Ten percent of the unspent
and unencumbered appropriations made before June 30, 2011, that would not otherwise cancel on
June 30, 2011, that are transferred to the chief information officer, may be used for expenses relating
to the transfer of functions under sections 1 to 8.
   Sec. 6. TRANSFERS; TRANSITION.
    (a) Powers, duties, responsibilities, assets, personnel, and unexpended appropriations relating
to functions assigned to the chief information officer in Minnesota Statutes, section 16E.0151,
are transferred to the Office of Enterprise Technology from all other state agencies, as defined
in Minnesota Statutes, section 16E.03, subdivision 1, paragraph (e), effective July 1, 2011. All
reporting relationships associated with the transferred powers, duties, responsibilities, assets,
personnel, and unexpended appropriations are also transferred to the Office of Enterprise
Technology on July 1, 2011. By January 15, 2012, the chief information officer shall submit to the
legislature any statutory changes needed to complete implementation of the transfer in this section.
59TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                         2265

    (b) Prior to the transfer mandated by paragraph (a), the chief information officer must enter into a
service-level agreement with each state agency governing the provision of information technology
systems and services in Minnesota Statutes, section 16E.0151. The agreements must specify the
services to be provided and the charges for these services. As specified in Minnesota Statutes, section
16E.0151, an agency may choose to obtain these services from an outside vendor, rather than from
the Office of Enterprise Technology. Authority to enter into agreements under this paragraph is
effective the day following final enactment, with the resulting agreements effective July 1, 2011.
    (c) Powers, duties, responsibilities, assets, personnel, and unexpended appropriations relating
to geospatial information systems are transferred from the commissioner of administration to the
Office of Enterprise Technology.
    (d) Minnesota Statutes, section 15.039, applies to transfers in this section. Executive branch
officials may use authority under Minnesota Statutes, section 16B.37, as necessary to implement
this section.
    (e) The transfer of authority to the Office of Enterprise Technology in this article does not require

Minnesota to determine the 75th percentile for like-care arrangements in counties. When the
commissioner determines that, using the commissioner's established protocol, the number of
providers responding to the survey is too small to determine the 75th percentile rate for like-care
arrangements in a county or multicounty region, the commissioner may establish the 75th
percentile maximum rate based on like-care arrangements in a county, region, or category that the
commissioner deems to be similar.

shall pay the provider's full charges for every child in care up to the maximum established. The
commissioner shall determine the maximum rate for each type of care on an hourly, full-day, and
weekly basis, including special needs and disability care. The maximum payment to a provider for
one day of care must not exceed the daily rate. The maximum payment to a provider for one week
of care must not exceed the weekly rate.
    (e) Child care providers receiving reimbursement under this chapter must not be paid activity
fees or an additional amount above the maximum rates for care provided during nonstandard hours
for families receiving assistance.
    (f) When the provider charge is greater than the maximum provider rate allowed, the parent is
responsible for payment of the difference in the rates in addition to any family co-payment fee.
    (g) All maximum provider rates changes shall be implemented on the Monday following the
effective date of the maximum provider rate.

allotment authorized by the federal Food Stamp Program for a single individual which is in
effect on the first day of July of each year will be added to the standards of assistance established
in subdivisions 1 to 4 for adults under the age of 65 who qualify as shelter needy and are: (i)
relocating from an institution, or an adult mental health residential treatment program under section
256B.0622; (ii) eligible for the self-directed supports option as defined under section 256B.0657,
subdivision 2; or (iii) home and community-based waiver recipients living in their own home or
rented or leased apartment which is not owned, operated, or controlled by a provider of service not
related by blood or marriage, unless allowed under paragraph ­              (g­­
                                                                               ) (b).
    (2) Notwithstanding subdivision 3, paragraph (c), an individual eligible for the shelter needy
benefit under this paragraph is considered a household of one. An eligible individual who receives
this benefit prior to age 65 may continue to receive the benefit after the age of 65.
    (3) "Shelter needy" means that the assistance unit incurs monthly shelter costs that exceed 40
percent of the assistance unit's gross income before the application of this special needs standard.
"Gross income" for the purposes of this section is the applicant's or recipient's income as defined
in section 256D.35, subdivision 10, or the standard specified in subdivision 3, paragraph (a) or (b),
whichever is greater. A recipient of a federal or state housing subsidy, that limits shelter costs to a
percentage of gross income, shall not be considered shelter needy for purposes of this paragraph.

    (b) Each individual with income and resources less than the standard of assistance established
by the commissioner and who is a resident of the state shall be eligible for and entitled to group
residential housing if the assistance unit is:
    (1) a person who is suffering from a professionally certified permanent or temporary illness,
injury, or incapacity which is expected to continue for more than 90 days and which prevents the
person from obtaining or retaining employment;
    (2) a person who has been placed in, and is residing in, a licensed or certified facility for purposes
of physical or mental health or rehabilitation, or in an approved chemical dependency domiciliary
facility, if the placement is based on illness or incapacity and is according to a plan developed or
approved by the county agency through its director or designated representative;
     (3) a person not described in clause (1) or (2) who is diagnosed by a licensed physician,
psychological practitioner, or other qualified professional, as developmentally disabled or mentally
ill, and that condition prevents the person from obtaining or retaining employment;
    (4) a person who has been assessed by a vocational specialist and, in consultation with the county
agency, has been determined to be unemployable for purposes of this clause; a person is considered
employable if there exist positions of employment in the local labor market, regardless of the current
availability of openings for those positions, that the person is capable of performing. The person's
eligibility under this category must be reassessed at least annually. The county agency must provide
notice to the person not later than 30 days before annual eligibility under this item ends, informing
the person of the date annual eligibility will end and the need for vocational assessment if the person
wishes to continue eligibility under this clause. For purposes of establishing eligibility under this
clause, it is the applicant's or recipient's duty to obtain any needed vocational assessment;
      (5) a person who is determined by the county agency, according to permanent rules adopted
2282                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [59TH DAY

by the commissioner, to have a condition that qualifies under Minnesota's special education rules
as a specific learning disability, provided that a rehabilitation plan for the person is developed or
approved by the county agency, and the person is following the plan; or
    (6) a person whose alcohol and drug addiction is a material factor that contributes to the person's
disability.
    (c) As a condition of eligibility under paragraph (b), the recipient must complete an interim
assistance agreement and must apply for other maintenance benefits as specified in section 256N.35,
and must comply with efforts to determine the recipient's eligibility for those other maintenance
benefits.
    (d) As a condition of eligibility under this section, the recipient must complete at least 20
hours per month of volunteer or paid work. The county of residence shall determine what may
be included as volunteer work. Recipients must provide monthly proof of volunteer work on the
forms established by the county. A person who is unable to obtain or retain 20 hours per month of
volunteer or paid work due to a professionally certified illness, injury, disability, or incapacity must
not be made ineligible for group residential housing under this section.
    (e) The burden of providing documentation for a county agency to use to verify eligibility under
this section is upon the applicant or recipient. The county agency shall use documents already in
its possession to verify eligibility, and shall help the applicant or recipient obtain other existing
verification necessary to determine eligibility which the applicant or recipient does not have and is
unable to obtain.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective October 1, 2012.
   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256I.04, subdivision 2b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2b. Group residential housing agreements. (a) Agreements between county agencies
and providers of group residential housing must be in writing and must specify the name and
address under which the establishment subject to the agreement does business and under which the
establishment, or service provider, if different from the group residential housing establishment, is
licensed by the Department of Health or the Department of Human Services; the specific license
or registration from the Department of Health or the Department of Human Services held by the
provider and the number of beds subject to that license; the address of the location or locations at
which group residential housing is provided under this agreement; the per diem and monthly rates
that are to be paid from group residential housing funds for each eligible resident at each location;
the number of beds at each location which are subject to the group residential housing agreement;
whether the license holder is a not-for-profit corporation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code; and a statement that the agreement is subject to the provisions of sections 256I.01
to 256I.06 and subject to any changes to those sections. Group residential housing agreements may
be terminated with or without cause by either the county or the provider with two calendar months
prior notice.
    (b) Counties must not enter into agreements with providers of group residential housing that are
licensed as board and lodging with special services and that do not include a residency requirement
of at least 20 hours per month of volunteer or paid work. A person who is unable to obtain or
retain 20 hours per month of volunteer or paid work due to a professionally certified illness, injury,
disability, or incapacity must not be made ineligible for group residential housing under this section.

This paragraph does not apply to group residential housing providers who serve people aged 21 or
younger if the residents are required to attend school or improve independent living skills.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective May 1, 2012.
   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256I.05, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Supplementary service rates. (a) Subject to the provisions of section 256I.04,
subdivision 3, the county agency may negotiate a payment not to exceed $426.37 for other services
necessary to provide room and board provided by the group residence if the residence is licensed
by or registered by the Department of Health, or licensed by the Department of Human Services
to provide services in addition to room and board, and if the provider of services is not also
concurrently receiving funding for services for a recipient under a home and community-based
waiver under title XIX of the Social Security Act; or funding from the medical assistance program
under section 256B.0659, for personal care services for residents in the setting; or residing in a
setting which receives funding under Minnesota Rules, parts 9535.2000 to 9535.3000. If funding
is available for other necessary services through a home and community-based waiver, or personal
care services under section 256B.0659, then the GRH rate is limited to the rate set in subdivision 1.
Unless otherwise provided in law, in no case may the supplementary service rate exceed $426.37.
The registration and licensure requirement does not apply to establishments which are exempt
from state licensure because they are located on Indian reservations and for which the tribe has
prescribed health and safety requirements. Service payments under this section may be prohibited
under rules to prevent the supplanting of federal funds with state funds. The commissioner shall
pursue the feasibility of obtaining the approval of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to
provide home and community-based waiver services under title XIX of the Social Security Act for
residents who are not eligible for an existing home and community-based waiver due to a primary
diagnosis of mental illness or chemical dependency and shall apply for a waiver if it is determined
to be cost-effective.
    (b) The commissioner is authorized to make cost-neutral transfers from the GRH fund for beds
under this section to other funding programs administered by the department after consultation with
the county or counties in which the affected beds are located. The commissioner may also make
cost-neutral transfers from the GRH fund to county human service agencies for beds permanently
removed from the GRH census under a plan submitted by the county agency and approved by
the commissioner. The commissioner shall report the amount of any transfers under this provision
annually to the legislature.
    (c) The provisions of paragraph (b) do not apply to a facility that has its reimbursement rate
established under section 256B.431, subdivision 4, paragraph (c).
    (d) Counties must not negotiate supplementary service rates with providers of group residential
housing that are licensed as board and lodging with special services and that do not encourage a
policy of sobriety on their premises.

given the condition of the particular vehicle, the county agency may require the applicant or
participant document the loan value by securing a written statement from a motor vehicle dealer

that documents a lower loan value;

members in day-to-day living such as clothing, necessary household furniture, equipment, and other
basic maintenance items essential for daily living;

participant's home;
    (9) money in a separate escrow account that is needed to pay real estate taxes or insurance and
that is used for this purpose;

   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256J.37, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3c. Treatment of Supplemental Security Income. The county shall reduce the cash
portion of the MFIP grant by $50 per adult SSI recipient who resides in the household, and who
would otherwise be included in the MFIP assistance unit under section 256J.24, subdivision 2, but
is excluded solely due to the SSI recipient status under section 256J.24, subdivision 3, paragraph (a),
clause (1). If the SSI recipient receives less than $50 of SSI, only the amount received shall be used
in calculating the MFIP cash assistance payment. This provision does not apply to relative caregivers
who could elect to be included in the MFIP assistance unit under section 256J.24, subdivision 4,
unless the caregiver's children or stepchildren are included in the MFIP assistance unit.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective May 1, 2012.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256J.49, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
    Subd. 13. Work activity. (a) "Work activity" means any activity in a participant's approved
employment plan that leads to employment. For purposes of the MFIP program, this includes
activities that meet the definition of work activity under the participation requirements of TANF.
Work activity includes:
   (1) unsubsidized employment, including work study and paid apprenticeships or internships;
    (2) subsidized private sector or public sector employment, including grant diversion as specified
in section 256J.69, on-the-job training as specified in section 256J.66, paid work experience, and
supported work when a wage subsidy is provided;
   (3) unpaid work experience, including community service, volunteer work, the community
work experience program as specified in section 256J.67, unpaid apprenticeships or internships,

and supported work when a wage subsidy is not provided. Unpaid work experience is only an
option if the participant has been unable to obtain or maintain paid employment in the competitive
labor market, and no paid work experience programs are available to the participant. Prior to
placing a participant in unpaid work, the county must inform the participant that the participant
will be notified if a paid work experience or supported work position becomes available. Unless
a participant consents in writing to participate in unpaid work experience, the participant's
employment plan may only include unpaid work experience if including the unpaid work
experience in the plan will meet the following criteria:
    (i) the unpaid work experience will provide the participant specific skills or experience that
cannot be obtained through other work activity options where the participant resides or is willing to
reside; and
   (ii) the skills or experience gained through the unpaid work experience will result in higher
wages for the participant than the participant could earn without the unpaid work experience;
   (4) job search including job readiness assistance, job clubs, job placement, job-related
counseling, and job retention services;
     (5) job readiness education, including English as a second language (ESL) or functional work
literacy classes as limited by the provisions of section 256J.531, subdivision 2, general educational
development (GED) course work, high school completion, and adult basic education as limited by
the provisions of section 256J.531, subdivision 1;
    (6) job skills training directly related to employment, including education and training that can
reasonably be expected to lead to employment, as limited by the provisions of section 256J.53;
     (7) providing child care services to a participant who is working in a community service program;
   (8) activities included in the employment plan that is developed under section 256J.521,
subdivision 3; and
    (9) preemployment activities including chemical and mental health assessments, treatment, and
services; learning disabilities services; child protective services; family stabilization services; or
other programs designed to enhance employability.
   (b) "Work activity" does not include activities done for political purposes as defined in section
211B.01, subdivision 6.

the child's parent, guardian, or permanent legal custodian under section 260C.201, subdivision 11.
The team may be the same team as defined in section 260B.157, subdivision 3.
    (b) The social services agency shall determine whether a child brought to its attention for the
purposes described in this section is an Indian child, as defined in section 260C.007, subdivision 21,
and shall determine the identity of the Indian child's tribe, as defined in section 260.755, subdivision
9. When a child to be evaluated is an Indian child, the team provided in paragraph (a) shall include
a designated representative of the Indian child's tribe, unless the child's tribal authority declines to
appoint a representative. The Indian child's tribe may delegate its authority to represent the child to
any other federally recognized Indian tribe, as defined in section 260.755, subdivision 12.
    (c) If the court, prior to, or as part of, a final disposition, proposes to place a child:
    (1) for the primary purpose of treatment for an emotional disturbance, a developmental disability,
or chemical dependency in a residential treatment facility out of state or in one which is within the
state and licensed by the commissioner of human services under chapter 245A; or
    (2) in any out-of-home setting potentially exceeding 30 days in duration, including a
postdispositional placement in a facility licensed by the commissioner of corrections or human
services, the court shall ascertain whether the child is an Indian child and shall notify the county
welfare agency and, if the child is an Indian child, shall notify the Indian child's tribe. The
county's juvenile treatment screening team must either: (i) screen and evaluate the child and file its
recommendations with the court within 14 days of receipt of the notice; or (ii) elect not to screen a
given case and notify the court of that decision within three working days.

for the primary purpose of treatment for an emotional disturbance, a developmental disability, or
chemical dependency, in a residential treatment facility out of state nor in a residential treatment
facility within the state that is licensed under chapter 245A, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
    (1) a treatment professional certifies that an emergency requires the placement of the child in a
facility within the state;
    (2) the screening team has evaluated the child and recommended that a residential placement
is necessary to meet the child's treatment needs and the safety needs of the community, that it is a
cost-effective means of meeting the treatment needs, and that it will be of therapeutic value to the
child; or
    (3) the court, having reviewed a screening team recommendation against placement, determines
to the contrary that a residential placement is necessary. The court shall state the reasons for
its determination in writing, on the record, and shall respond specifically to the findings and
recommendation of the screening team in explaining why the recommendation was rejected. The
attorney representing the child and the prosecuting attorney shall be afforded an opportunity to be

    (e) When the county's juvenile treatment screening team has elected to screen and evaluate a
child determined to be an Indian child, the team shall provide notice to the tribe or tribes that
accept jurisdiction for the Indian child or that recognize the child as a member of the tribe or as
a person eligible for membership in the tribe, and permit the tribe's representative to participate in
the screening team.
    (f) When the Indian child's tribe or tribal health care services provider or Indian Health Services
provider proposes to place a child for the primary purpose of treatment for an emotional disturbance,
a developmental disability, or co-occurring emotional disturbance and chemical dependency, the
Indian child's tribe or the tribe delegated by the child's tribe shall submit necessary documentation to
the county juvenile treatment screening team, which must invite the Indian child's tribe to designate
a representative to the screening team.
   Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 260D.01, is amended to read:
   260D.01 CHILD IN VOLUNTARY FOSTER CARE FOR TREATMENT.
    (a) Sections 260D.01 to 260D.10, may be cited as the "child in voluntary foster care for
treatment" provisions of the Juvenile Court Act.
    (b) The juvenile court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over a child in voluntary foster care
for treatment upon the filing of a report or petition required under this chapter. All obligations of
the agency to a child and family in foster care contained in chapter 260C not inconsistent with this
chapter are also obligations of the agency with regard to a child in foster care for treatment under
this chapter.
    (c) This chapter shall be construed consistently with the mission of the children's mental health
service system as set out in section 245.487, subdivision 3, and the duties of an agency under section
256B.092, 260C.157, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0016, to meet the needs of a
child with a developmental disability or related condition. This chapter:
    (1) establishes voluntary foster care through a voluntary foster care agreement as the means for
an agency and a parent to provide needed treatment when the child must be in foster care to receive
necessary treatment for an emotional disturbance or developmental disability or related condition;
    (2) establishes court review requirements for a child in voluntary foster care for treatment due
to emotional disturbance or developmental disability or a related condition;
    (3) establishes the ongoing responsibility of the parent as legal custodian to visit the child, to
plan together with the agency for the child's treatment needs, to be available and accessible to the
agency to make treatment decisions, and to obtain necessary medical, dental, and other care for the
child; and
    (4) applies to voluntary foster care when the child's parent and the agency agree that the child's
treatment needs require foster care either:
   (i) due to a level of care determination by the agency's screening team informed by the diagnostic
and functional assessment under section 245.4885; or
   (ii) due to a determination regarding the level of services needed by the responsible social

services' screening team under section 256B.092, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to
9525.0016.
    (d) This chapter does not apply when there is a current determination under section 626.556 that
the child requires child protective services or when the child is in foster care for any reason other
than treatment for the child's emotional disturbance or developmental disability or related condition.
When there is a determination under section 626.556 that the child requires child protective services
based on an assessment that there are safety and risk issues for the child that have not been mitigated
through the parent's engagement in services or otherwise, or when the child is in foster care for any
reason other than the child's emotional disturbance or developmental disability or related condition,
the provisions of chapter 260C apply.
    (e) The paramount consideration in all proceedings concerning a child in voluntary foster care
for treatment is the safety, health, and the best interests of the child. The purpose of this chapter is:
   (1) to ensure a child with a disability is provided the services necessary to treat or ameliorate the
symptoms of the child's disability;
    (2) to preserve and strengthen the child's family ties whenever possible and in the child's best
interests, approving the child's placement away from the child's parents only when the child's need
for care or treatment requires it and the child cannot be maintained in the home of the parent; and
    (3) to ensure the child's parent retains legal custody of the child and associated decision-making
authority unless the child's parent willfully fails or is unable to make decisions that meet the child's
safety, health, and best interests. The court may not find that the parent willfully fails or is unable
to make decisions that meet the child's needs solely because the parent disagrees with the agency's
choice of foster care facility, unless the agency files a petition under chapter 260C, and establishes
by clear and convincing evidence that the child is in need of protection or services.
    (f) The legal parent-child relationship shall be supported under this chapter by maintaining the
parent's legal authority and responsibility for ongoing planning for the child and by the agency's
assisting the parent, where necessary, to exercise the parent's ongoing right and obligation to visit
or to have reasonable contact with the child. Ongoing planning means:
   (1) actively participating in the planning and provision of educational services, medical, and
dental care for the child;
    (2) actively planning and participating with the agency and the foster care facility for the child's
treatment needs; and
    (3) planning to meet the child's need for safety, stability, and permanency, and the child's need
to stay connected to the child's family and community.
     (g) The provisions of section 260.012 to ensure placement prevention, family reunification, and
all active and reasonable effort requirements of that section apply. This chapter shall be construed
consistently with the requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, United States Code,
title 25, section 1901, et al., and the provisions of the Minnesota Indian Family Preservation Act,
sections 260.751 to 260.835.

   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 518A.51, is amended to read:
   518A.51 FEES FOR IV-D SERVICES.
    (a) When a recipient of IV-D services is no longer receiving assistance under the state's title IV-A,
IV-E foster care, medical assistance, or MinnesotaCare programs, the public authority responsible
for child support enforcement must notify the recipient, within five working days of the notification
of ineligibility, that IV-D services will be continued unless the public authority is notified to the
contrary by the recipient. The notice must include the implications of continuing to receive IV-D
services, including the available services and fees, cost recovery fees, and distribution policies
relating to fees.
    (b) An application fee of $25 shall be paid by the person who applies for child support and
maintenance collection services, except persons who are receiving public assistance as defined in
section 256.741 and the diversionary work program under section 256J.95, persons who transfer
from public assistance to nonpublic assistance status, and minor parents and parents enrolled in
a public secondary school, area learning center, or alternative learning program approved by the
commissioner of education.
    (c) In the case of an individual who has never received assistance under a state program funded
under Title IV-A of the Social Security Act and for whom the public authority has collected at least
$500 of support, the public authority must impose an annual federal collections fee of $25 for each
case in which services are furnished. This fee must be retained by the public authority from support
collected on behalf of the individual, but not from the first $500 collected.
    (d) When the public authority provides full IV-D services to an obligee who has applied for
those services, upon written notice to the obligee, the public authority must charge a cost recovery
fee of one percent of the amount collected. This fee must be deducted from the amount of the child
support and maintenance collected and not assigned under section 256.741 before disbursement to
the obligee. This fee does not apply to an obligee who:
    (1) is currently receiving assistance under the state's title IV-A, IV-E foster care, medical
assistance, or MinnesotaCare programs; or
59TH DAY]                                     WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                                             2295

   (2) has received assistance under the state's title IV-A or IV-E foster care programs, until the
person has not received this assistance for 24 consecutive months.
    (e) When the public authority provides full IV-D services to an obligor who has applied for such
services, upon written notice to the obligor, the public authority must charge a cost recovery fee of
one percent of the monthly court-ordered child support and maintenance obligation. The fee may
be collected through income withholding, as well as by any other enforcement remedy available to
the public authority responsible for child support enforcement.
    (f) Fees assessed by state and federal tax agencies for collection of overdue support owed to or
on behalf of a person not receiving public assistance must be imposed on the person for whom these
services are provided. The public authority upon written notice to the obligee shall assess a fee of
$25 to the person not receiving public assistance for each successful federal tax interception. The
fee must be withheld prior to the release of the funds received from each interception and deposited
in the general fund.
    (g) Federal collections fees collected under paragraph (c) and cost recovery fees collected under
paragraphs (d) and (e), retained by the commissioner of human services, shall be considered child
support program income according to Code of Federal Regulations, title 45, section 304.50, and shall
be deposited in the special revenue fund account established under paragraph (i). The commissioner
of human services must elect to recover costs based on either actual or standardized costs.
   (h) The limitations of this section on the assessment of fees shall not apply to the extent
inconsistent with the requirements of federal law for receiving funds for the programs under Title
IV-A and Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, United States Code, title 42, sections 601 to 613
and United States Code, title 42, sections 651 to 662.
    (i) The commissioner of human services is authorized to establish a special revenue fund account
to receive the federal collections fees collected under paragraph (c) and cost recovery fees collected
under paragraphs (d) and (e). A portion of the nonfederal share of these fees may be retained for
expenditures necessary to administer the fees and must be transferred to the child support system
special revenue account. T       ­h­­

    (i) a public program volume factor, which is determined by the total volume of public program
revenue received by each training site as a percentage of all public program revenue received by all
training sites in the fund pool; and
    (ii) a supplemental public program volume factor, which is determined by providing a
supplemental payment of 20 percent of each training site's grant to training sites whose public
program revenue accounted for at least 0.98 percent of the total public program revenue received
by all eligible training sites. Grants to training sites whose public program revenue accounted for
less than 0.98 percent of the total public program revenue received by all eligible training sites
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the total value of the supplemental payment.
    Public program revenue for the distribution formula includes revenue from medical assistance,
prepaid medical assistance, general assistance medical care, and prepaid general assistance medical
care. Training sites that receive no public program revenue are ineligible for funds available under
this subdivision. For purposes of determining training site level grants to be distributed under
paragraph (a), total statewide average costs per trainee for medical residents is based on audited
clinical training costs per trainee in primary care clinical medical education programs for medical
residents. Total statewide average costs per trainee for dental residents is based on audited clinical
training costs per trainee in clinical medical education programs for dental students. Total statewide
average costs per trainee for pharmacy residents is based on audited clinical training costs per
trainee in clinical medical education programs for pharmacy students.
    (2) Ten percent of available medical education funds shall be used to create a primary care
bonus pool. Grants to eligible training sites under this clause shall be determined by dividing the
total number of eligible FTE trainees from primary care medicine, advanced practice nursing, or
physician assistant programs at all eligible training sites by the amount of funds available in the
primary care bonus pool to determine a grant per primary care FTE; each eligible training site shall
receive a grant equal to the grant per primary care FTE multiplied by the number of eligible primary
care FTE's at the training site.
    (3) After determining the grant amount for each training site under clause (1), items (i) and (ii),
and clause (2), the commissioner shall calculate a grant per eligible trainee for each training site.
Any training site whose grant per eligible trainee is greater than the 95th percentile grant per eligible
trainee shall have the grant amount reduced to the 95th percentile grant per eligible trainee. Grants
in excess of this amount for any training site shall be redistributed based on the criteria in clause (4).
    Any training site with fewer than 0.1 FTE eligible trainees from all programs or a calculated
grant less than $1,000 based on the formula described in clauses (1) and (2) shall be eliminated
from the distribution; the calculated grants for these training sites shall be redistributed based on the
criteria in clause (4).
    (4) The commissioner shall award from available funds appropriated for this purpose and equally
divided between the following programs:
   (i) the community mental health center grants program under section 145.9272; and
   (ii) the community health centers development grants program under section 145.987.
   If federal approval for this funding mechanism is not received for either of the grant programs
described in this paragraph, available funds will be provided to the remaining grant program

described in this paragraph. If none of the grant programs described in this paragraph receive
federal approval, available funds will be distributed to eligible training sites based on the formula
in clauses (1) to (3).
    (b) Funds distributed shall not be used to displace current funding appropriations from federal
or state sources.
    (c) Funds shall be distributed to the sponsoring institutions indicating the amount to be
distributed to each of the sponsor's clinical medical education programs based on the criteria in this
subdivision and according to the commissioner's approval letter. Each clinical medical education
program must distribute funds allocated under paragraph (a) to the training sites as specified
in the commissioner's approval letter. Sponsoring institutions, which are accredited through an
organization recognized by the Department of Education or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services, may contract directly with training sites to provide clinical training. To ensure the quality
of clinical training, those accredited sponsoring institutions must:
   (1) develop contracts specifying the terms, expectations, and outcomes of the clinical training
conducted at sites; and
   (2) take necessary action if the contract requirements are not met. Action may include the
withholding of payments under this section or the removal of students from the site.
    (d) Any funds not distributed according to the commissioner's approval letter must be returned to
the medical education and research fund within 30 days of receiving notice from the commissioner.
The commissioner shall distribute returned funds to the appropriate training sites according to the
commissioner's approval letter.
   (e) A maximum of $150,000 of the funds dedicated to the commissioner under section 297F.10,
subdivision 1, clause (2), may be used by the commissioner for administrative expenses associated
with implementing this section.

conduct background studies according to this chapter when initiated by a children's therapeutic
services and supports provider under section 256B.0943.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 245C.10, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 8. Children's therapeutic services and supports providers. The commissioner shall
recover the cost of background studies required under section 245C.03, subdivision 7, for the
purposes of children's therapeutic services and supports under section 256B.0943, through a fee of
no more than $20 per study charged to the license holder. The fees collected under this subdivision
are appropriated to the commissioner for the purpose of conducting background studies.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.04, subdivision 14a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 14a. Level of need determination. Nonemergency medical transportation level of
need determinations must be performed by a physician, a registered nurse working under direct
supervision of a physician, a physician's assistant, a nurse practitioner, a licensed practical nurse,
or a discharge planner.
    Nonemergency medical transportation level of need determinations must not be performed more
than annually on any individual, unless the individual's circumstances have sufficiently changed so
as to require a new level of need determination. No entity shall charge, and the commissioner shall
pay, no more than $25 for performing a level of need determination regarding any person receiving
nonemergency medical transportation, including special transportation.
    Special transportation services to eligible persons who need a stretcher-accessible vehicle from
an inpatient or outpatient hospital are exempt from a level of need determination if the special
transportation services have been ordered by the eligible person's physician, registered nurse
working under direct supervision of a physician, physician's assistant, nurse practitioner, licensed
practical nurse, or discharge planner pursuant to Medicare guidelines.

need determination and are eligible for special transportation services until the individual no longer
resides in a licensed nursing facility. If a person authorized by this subdivision to perform a level
of need determination determines that an individual requires stretcher transportation, the individual
is presumed to maintain that level of need until otherwise determined by a person authorized to
perform a level of need determination, or for six months, whichever is sooner.

The commissioner may use an order by the recipient's attending physician to certify that the
recipient requires special transportation services. Special transportation providers shall perform
driver-assisted services for eligible individuals. Driver-assisted service includes passenger pickup
at and return to the individual's residence or place of business, assistance with admittance of
the individual to the medical facility, and assistance in passenger securement or in securing of
wheelchairs or stretchers in the vehicle. Special transportation providers must obtain written
documentation from the health care service provider who is serving the recipient being transported,
identifying the time that the recipient arrived. Special transportation providers may not bill
for separate base rates for the continuation of a trip beyond the original destination. Special
transportation providers must take recipients to the nearest appropriate health care provider,
using the most direct route as determined by a commercially available mileage software program
approved by the commissioner. The minimum medical assistance reimbursement rates for special
transportation services are:
   (1) (i) $17 for the base rate and $1.35 per mile for special transportation services to eligible
persons who need a wheelchair-accessible van;
   (ii) $11.50 for the base rate and $1.30 per mile for special transportation services to eligible
persons who do not need a wheelchair-accessible van; and
    (iii) $60 for the base rate and $2.40 per mile, and an attendant rate of $9 per trip, for special
transportation services to eligible persons who need a stretcher-accessible vehicle;
    (2) the base rates for special transportation services in areas defined under RUCA to be super
rural shall be equal to the reimbursement rate established in clause (1) plus 11.3 percent; and
    (3) for special transportation services in areas defined under RUCA to be rural or super rural
areas:
    (i) for a trip equal to 17 miles or less, mileage reimbursement shall be equal to 125 percent of
the respective mileage rate in clause (1); and
    (ii) for a trip between 18 and 50 miles, mileage reimbursement shall be equal to 112.5 percent

receiving long-term care services in a long-term care facility or home care services pursuant to
the Medicaid waiver for elderly services under section 256B.0915 or the alternative care program
under section 256B.0913. A community spouse does not include a spouse living in the community
who receives a monthly income allowance under section 256B.058, subdivision 2, or who receives
home and community-based services under section 256B.0915, 256B.092, or 256B.49, or the

age based on the Social Security Administration disability standards;
    (6) "income" means earned and unearned income, attributable to the community spouse, used

    (b) The community spouse of a long-term care spouse who receives medical assistance or
alternative care services has an obligation to contribute to the cost of care. The community spouse
must pay a monthly fee on a sliding fee scale based on the community spouse's income. If a minor
or disabled child resides with and receives care from the community spouse, then no fee shall be
assessed.
    (c) For a community spouse with an income equal to or greater than 250 percent of the federal
poverty guidelines for a family of two and less than 545 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for
a family of two, the spousal contribution shall be determined using a sliding fee scale established by
the commissioner that begins at 7.5 percent of the community spouse's income and increases to 15
percent for those with an income of up to 545 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for a family
of two.
59TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                       2325

    (d) For a community spouse with an income equal to or greater than 545 percent of the federal
poverty guidelines for a family of two and less than 750 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for
a family of two, the spousal contribution shall be determined using a sliding fee scale established by
the commissioner that begins at 15 percent of the community spouse's income and increases to 25
percent for those with an income of up to 750 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for a family
of two.
    (e) For a community spouse with an income equal to or greater than 750 percent of the federal
poverty guidelines for a family of two and less than 975 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for
a family of two, the spousal contribution shall be determined using a sliding fee scale established by
the commissioner that begins at 25 percent of the community spouse's income and increases to 33
percent for those with an income of up to 975 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for a family
of two.
   (f) For a community spouse with an income equal to or greater than 975 percent of the federal
poverty guidelines for a family of two, the spousal contribution shall be 33 percent of the community
spouse's income.
    (g) The spousal contribution shall be explained in writing at the time eligibility for medical
assistance or alternative care is being determined. In addition to explaining the formula used to
determine the fee, the county or tribal agency shall provide written information describing how to
request a variance for undue hardship, how a contribution may be reviewed or redetermined, the
right to appeal a contribution determination, and that the consequences for not complying with a
request to provide information shall be an assessment against the community spouse for the full
cost of care for the long-term care spouse.
   (h) The contribution shall be assessed for each month the long-term care spouse has a community
spouse and is eligible for medical assistance payment of long-term care services or alternative care.
    (i) The spousal contribution shall be reviewed at least once every 12 months and when there is
a loss or gain in income in excess of ten percent. Thirty days prior to a review or redetermination,
written notice must be provided to the community spouse and must contain the amount the spouse is
required to contribute, notice of the right to redetermination and appeal, and the telephone number
of the division at the agency that is responsible for redetermination and review. If, after review,
the contribution amount is to be adjusted, the county or tribal agency shall mail a written notice to
the community spouse 30 days in advance of the effective date of the change in the amount of the
contribution.
    (1) The spouse shall notify the county or tribal agency within 30 days of a gain or loss in income
in excess of ten percent and provide the agency supporting documentation to verify the need for
redetermination of the fee.
    (2) When a spouse requests a review or redetermination of the contribution amount, a request
for information shall be sent to the spouse within ten calendar days after the county or tribal agency
receives the request for review.
    (3) No action shall be taken on a review or redetermination until the required information is
received by the county or tribal agency.
   (4) The review of the spousal contribution shall be completed within ten days after the county
2326                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [59TH DAY

or tribal agency receives completed information that verifies a loss or gain in income in excess of
ten percent.
   (5) An increase in the contribution amount is effective in the month in which the increase in
income occurs.
   (6) A decrease in the contribution amount is effective in the month the spouse verifies the
reduction in income, retroactive to no longer than six months.
    (j) In no case shall the spousal contribution exceed the amount of medical assistance expended
or the cost of alternative care services for the care of the long-term care spouse. Annually, upon
redetermination, or at termination of eligibility, the total amount of medical assistance paid or costs
of alternative care for the care of the long-term care spouse and the total amount of the spousal
contribution shall be compared. If the total amount of the spousal contribution exceeds the total
amount of medical assistance expended or cost of alternative care, then the agency shall reimburse
the community spouse the excess amount if the long-term care spouse is no longer receiving services,
or apply the excess amount to the spousal contribution due until the excess amount is exhausted.
    (k) A community spouse may request a variance by submitting a written request and supporting
documentation that payment of the calculated contribution would cause an undue hardship. An
undue hardship is defined as the inability to pay the calculated contribution due to medical expenses
incurred by the community spouse. Documentation must include proof of medical expenses incurred
by the community spouse since the last annual redetermination of the contribution amount that are
not reimbursable by any public or private source, and are a type, regardless of amount, that would
be allowable as a federal tax deduction under the Internal Revenue Code.
    (1) A spouse who requests a variance from a notice of an increase in the amount of spousal
contribution shall continue to make monthly payments at the lower amount pending determination
of the variance request. A spouse who requests a variance from the initial determination shall not be
required to make a payment pending determination of the variance request. Payments made pending
outcome of the variance request that result in overpayment must be returned to the spouse, if the
long-term care spouse is no longer receiving services, or applied to the spousal contribution in the
current year. If the variance is denied, the spouse shall pay the additional amount due from the
effective date of the increase or the total amount due from the effective date of the original notice
of determination of the spousal contribution.
    (2) A spouse who is granted a variance shall sign a written agreement in which the spouse agrees
to report to the county or tribal agency any changes in circumstances that gave rise to the undue
hardship variance.
    (3) When the county or tribal agency receives a request for a variance, written notice of a grant or
denial of the variance shall be mailed to the spouse within 30 calendar days after the county or tribal
agency receives the financial information required in this clause. The granting of a variance will
necessitate a written agreement between the spouse and the county or tribal agency with regard to
the specific terms of the variance. The variance will not become effective until the written agreement
is signed by the spouse. If the county or tribal agency denies in whole or in part the request for a
variance, the denial notice shall set forth in writing the reasons for the denial that address the specific
hardship and right to appeal.
   (4) If a variance is granted, the term of the variance shall not exceed 12 months unless otherwise
59TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                        2327

determined by the county or tribal agency.
    (5) Undue hardship does not include action taken by a spouse which divested or diverted income
in order to avoid being assessed a spousal contribution.
    (l) A spouse aggrieved by an action under this subdivision has the right to appeal under
subdivision 4. If the spouse appeals on or before the effective date of an increase in the spousal
fee, the spouse shall continue to make payments to the county or tribal agency in the lower amount
while the appeal is pending. A spouse appealing an initial determination of a spousal contribution
shall not be required to make monthly payments pending an appeal decision. Payments made
that result in an overpayment shall be reimbursed to the spouse if the long-term care spouse is
no longer receiving services, or applied to the spousal contribution remaining in the current year.
If the county or tribal agency's determination is affirmed, the community spouse shall pay within
90 calendar days of the order the total amount due from the effective date of the original notice
of determination of the spousal contribution. The commissioner's order is binding on the spouse
and the agency and shall be implemented subject to section 256.045, subdivision 7. No additional
notice is required to enforce the commissioner's order.
    (m) If the county or tribal agency finds that notice of the payment obligation was given to the
community spouse and the spouse was determined to be able to pay, but that the spouse failed or
refused to pay, a cause of action exists against the community spouse for that portion of medical
assistance payment of long-term care services or alternative care services granted after notice was
given to the community spouse. The action may be brought by the county or tribal agency in the
county where assistance was granted for the assistance together with the costs of disbursements
incurred due to the action. In addition to granting the county or tribal agency a money judgment, the
court may, upon a motion or order to show cause, order continuing contributions by a community
spouse found able to repay the county or tribal agency. The order shall be effective only for the
period of time during which a contribution shall be assessed.
    (n) Counties and tribes are entitled to one-half of the nonfederal share of contributions made
under this section for long-term care spouses on medical assistance that are directly attributed to
county or tribal efforts. Counties and tribes are entitled to 25 percent of the contributions made
under this section for long-term care spouses on alternative care directly attributed to county or
tribal efforts.

ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE PROPOSAL.
    (a) The commissioner of human services shall develop a proposal to create a single
administrative structure for providing nonemergency medical transportation services to
fee-for-service medical assistance recipients. This proposal must consolidate access and special
transportation into one administrative structure with the goal of standardizing eligibility
determination processes, scheduling arrangements, billing procedures, data collection, and
oversight mechanisms in order to enhance coordination, improve accountability, and lessen
confusion.
   (b) In developing the proposal, the commissioner shall:
   (1) examine the current responsibilities performed by the counties and the Department of Human
Services and consider the shift in costs if these responsibilities are changed;
    (2) identify key performance measures to assess the cost effectiveness of nonemergency medical
transportation statewide, including a process to collect, audit, and report data;
    (3) develop a statewide complaint system for medical assistance recipients using special
transportation;
   (4) establish a standardized billing process;
    (5) establish a process that provides public input from interested parties before special
transportation eligibility policies are implemented or significantly changed;

transporting recipients to or from health-related appointments; and
    (8) establish specific eligibility criteria to maximize the use of public transportation by recipients
who are without a physical, mental, or other impairment that would prohibit safely accessing and
using public transportation.

   Sec. 8. [148.2855] NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT.
    The Nurse Licensure Compact is enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions
legally joining in it, in the form substantially as follows:
                                               ARTICLE 1
                                             DEFINITIONS
   As used in this compact:
   (a) "Adverse action" means a home or remote state action.
   (b) "Alternative program" means a voluntary, nondisciplinary monitoring program approved by
a nurse licensing board.
    (c) "Coordinated licensure information system" means an integrated process for collecting,
storing, and sharing information on nurse licensure and enforcement activities related to nurse
licensure laws, which is administered by a nonprofit organization composed of and controlled by
state nurse licensing boards.
   (d) "Current significant investigative information" means:
    (1) investigative information that a licensing board, after a preliminary inquiry that includes
notification and an opportunity for the nurse to respond if required by state law, has reason to believe
is not groundless and, if proved true, would indicate more than a minor infraction; or
   (2) investigative information that indicates that the nurse represents an immediate threat to public
health and safety regardless of whether the nurse has been notified and had an opportunity to respond.
   (e) "Home state" means the party state which is the nurse's primary state of residence.
    (f) "Home state action" means any administrative, civil, equitable, or criminal action permitted
by the home state's laws which are imposed on a nurse by the home state's licensing board or other
authority including actions against an individual's license such as revocation, suspension, probation,
or any other action which affects a nurse's authorization to practice.
    (g) "Licensing board" means a party state's regulatory body responsible for issuing nurse
licenses.
   (h) "Multistate licensure privilege" means current, official authority from a remote state
permitting the practice of nursing as either a registered nurse or a licensed practical/vocational

other action which affects a nurse's authorization to practice.
    (i) "Nurse" means a registered nurse or licensed practical/vocational nurse as those terms are
defined by each party state's practice laws.
   (j) "Party state" means any state that has adopted this compact.

    (2) in the case of the practice of nursing not involving a patient, in the party state where the
recipient of nursing practice is located.
   (l) "Remote state action" means:
    (1) any administrative, civil, equitable, or criminal action permitted by a remote state's laws
which are imposed on a nurse by the remote state's licensing board or other authority including
actions against an individual's multistate licensure privilege to practice in the remote state; and
    (2) cease and desist and other injunctive or equitable orders issued by remote states or the
licensing boards of those states.
    (m) "State" means a state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia,
or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    (n) "State practice laws" means individual party state laws and regulations that govern the

the home state.
                                               ARTICLE 2
                           GENERAL PROVISIONS AND JURISDICTION
    (a) A license to practice registered nursing issued by a home state to a resident in that state will
be recognized by each party state as authorizing a multistate licensure privilege to practice as a
registered nurse in the party state. A license to practice licensed practical/vocational nursing issued
by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing a
multistate licensure privilege to practice as a licensed practical/vocational nurse in the party state.
In order to obtain or retain a license, an applicant must meet the home state's qualifications for
licensure and license renewal as well as all other applicable state laws.
    (b) Party states may, according to state due process laws, limit or revoke the multistate licensure
privilege of any nurse to practice in their state and may take any other actions under their applicable
state laws necessary to protect the health and safety of their citizens. If a party state takes such
action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system.
The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home
state of any such actions by remote states.
    (c) Every nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the state
in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered. In addition, the practice of nursing is not
limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of
the party state. The practice of nursing will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the nurse licensing
board, the courts, and the laws in the party state.
    (d) This compact does not affect additional requirements imposed by states for advanced practice
registered nursing. However, a multistate licensure privilege to practice registered nursing granted
by a party state shall be recognized by other party states as a license to practice registered nursing if
one is required by state law as a precondition for qualifying for advanced practice registered nurse
authorization.
59TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                        2335

    (e) Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for nurse licensure
as provided for under the laws of each party state. However, the license granted to these individuals
will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice nursing in any other party state unless
explicitly agreed to by that party state.
                                               ARTICLE 3
                      APPLICATIONS FOR LICENSURE IN A PARTY STATE
    (a) Upon application for a license, the licensing board in a party state shall ascertain, through
the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held or is the holder
of a license issued by any other state, whether there are any restrictions on the multistate licensure
privilege, and whether any other adverse action by a state has been taken against the license.
   (b) A nurse in a party state shall hold licensure in only one party state at a time, issued by the
home state.
    (c) A nurse who intends to change primary state of residence may apply for licensure in the new
home state in advance of the change. However, new licenses will not be issued by a party state until
after a nurse provides evidence of change in primary state of residence satisfactory to the new home
state's licensing board.
   (d) When a nurse changes primary state of residence by:
   (1) moving between two party states, and obtains a license from the new home state, the license
from the former home state is no longer valid;
    (2) moving from a nonparty state to a party state, and obtains a license from the new home state,
the individual state license issued by the nonparty state is not affected and will remain in full force
if so provided by the laws of the nonparty state; or
    (3) moving from a party state to a nonparty state, the license issued by the prior home state
converts to an individual state license, valid only in the former home state, without the multistate
licensure privilege to practice in other party states.
                                               ARTICLE 4
                                         ADVERSE ACTIONS
   In addition to the general provisions described in article 2, the provisions in this article apply.
    (a) The licensing board of a remote state shall promptly report to the administrator of the
coordinated licensure information system any remote state actions including the factual and legal
basis for the action, if known. The licensing board of a remote state shall also promptly report any
significant current investigative information yet to result in a remote state action. The administrator
of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any reports.
    (b) The licensing board of a party state shall have the authority to complete any pending
investigation for a nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of the
investigation. The board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action, and shall promptly
report the conclusion of the investigation to the administrator of the coordinated licensure
information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall
2336                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [59TH DAY

promptly notify the new home state of any action.
   (c) A remote state may take adverse action affecting the multistate licensure privilege to practice
within that party state. However, only the home state shall have the power to impose adverse action
against the license issued by the home state.
    (d) For purposes of imposing adverse actions, the licensing board of the home state shall give
the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if the
conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, it shall apply its own state laws to determine
appropriate action.
   (e) The home state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state,
provided each state follows its own procedures for imposing the adverse action.
    (f) Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an
alternative program may be used in lieu of licensure action and that participation shall remain
nonpublic if required by the party state's laws.
   Party states must require nurses who enter any alternative programs to agree not to practice in
any other party state during the term of the alternative program without prior authorization from the
other party state.
                                              ARTICLE 5
                           ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES INVESTED IN
                           PARTY STATE NURSE LICENSING BOARDS
   Notwithstanding any other laws, party state nurse licensing boards shall have the authority to:
   (1) if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected nurse the costs of investigation
and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that nurse;
    (2) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations which require the attendance and
testimony of witnesses, and the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a nurse licensing
board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and the production of evidence
from another party state, shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction
according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings
pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and
other fees required by the service statutes of the state where the witnesses and evidence are located;
    (3) issue cease and desist orders to limit or revoke a nurse's authority to practice in the nurse's
state; and
   (4) adopt uniform rules and regulations as provided for in article 7, paragraph (c).
                                              ARTICLE 6
                     COORDINATED LICENSURE INFORMATION SYSTEM
    (a) All party states shall participate in a cooperative effort to create a coordinated database of
all licensed registered nurses and licensed practical/vocational nurses. This system shall include
information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each nurse, as contributed by party states,
59TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                         2337

to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and enforcement efforts.
    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party states' licensing boards shall promptly
report adverse actions, actions against multistate licensure privileges, any current significant
investigative information yet to result in adverse action, denials of applications, and the reasons
for the denials to the coordinated licensure information system.
    (c) Current significant investigative information shall be transmitted through the coordinated
licensure information system only to party state licensing boards.
    (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party states' licensing boards contributing
information to the coordinated licensure information system may designate information that may
not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express
permission of the contributing state.
    (e) Any personally identifiable information obtained by a party state's licensing board from the
coordinated licensure information system may not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to
other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing
the information.
   (f) Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is
subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that information
shall also be expunged from the coordinated licensure information system.
   (g) The compact administrators, acting jointly with each other and in consultation with the
administrator of the coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and proper
procedures for the identification, collection, and exchange of information under this compact.

                                 INTERCHANGE OF INFORMATION
    (a) The head or designee of the nurse licensing board of each party state shall be the administrator
of this compact for that state.
    (b) The compact administrator of each party state shall furnish to the compact administrator of
each other party state any information and documents including, but not limited to, a uniform data
set of investigations, identifying information, licensure data, and disclosable alternative program
participation information to facilitate the administration of this compact.
   (c) Compact administrators shall have the authority to develop uniform rules to facilitate and
coordinate implementation of this compact. These uniform rules shall be adopted by party states

Any party state may withdraw from this compact by repealing the nurse licensure compact, but no
withdrawal shall take effect until six months after the withdrawing state has given notice of the
withdrawal to the executive heads of all other party states.
   (b) No withdrawal shall affect the validity or applicability by the licensing boards of states
remaining party to the compact of any report of adverse action occurring prior to the withdrawal.

improve physical or mental health, subject to all laws and rules regulating health service providers
and products within the state of Minnesota.

the mode of securing health care services, or to impose a penalty related to that choice, is not found

Minnesota regarding the right of all persons residing in the state in choosing the mode of securing
health care services.
    (b) It is hereby declared that the public policy of the state of Minnesota, consistent with our

services without penalty or threat of penalty.

to the provision of health care services to any person or group.

paragraphs (a) to (d) and (f), the association shall, using the information collected pursuant to this
subdivision, list insurers and health maintenance organizations in rank order of the total number
of individuals covered by each insurer or health maintenance organization. The association shall

covered.
   The association may elect to use a sample of information from the insurers and health
maintenance organizations for purposes of computing a weighted average. In no case, however,

fewer than the two insurers or health maintenance organizations highest in rank order.

     Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 62U.04, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Provider peer grouping. (a) The commissioner shall develop a peer grouping system
for providers based on a combined measure that incorporates both provider risk-adjusted cost of care
and quality of care, and for specific conditions as determined by the commissioner. In developing
this system, the commissioner shall consult and coordinate with health care providers, health plan
companies, state agencies, and organizations that work to improve health care quality in Minnesota.
For purposes of the final establishment of the peer grouping system, the commissioner shall not
contract with any private entity, organization, or consortium of entities that has or will have a direct
financial interest in the outcome of the system.
    (b) By no later than October 15, 2010, the commissioner shall disseminate information to
providers on their total cost of care, total resource use, total quality of care, and the total care results
of the grouping developed under this subdivision in comparison to an appropriate peer group.
Any analyses or reports that identify providers may only be published after the provider has been
provided the opportunity by the commissioner to review the underlying data and submit comments.
Providers may be given any data for which they are the subject of the data. The provider shall have
30 days to review the data for accuracy and initiate an appeal as specified in paragraph (d).
    (c) By no later than January 1, 2011, the commissioner shall disseminate information to
providers on their condition-specific cost of care, condition-specific resource use, condition-specific
quality of care, and the condition-specific results of the grouping developed under this subdivision
in comparison to an appropriate peer group. Any analyses or reports that identify providers may
only be published after the provider has been provided the opportunity by the commissioner to
review the underlying data and submit comments. Providers may be given any data for which they
are the subject of the data. The provider shall have 30 days to review the data for accuracy and
initiate an appeal as specified in paragraph (d).
     (d) The commissioner shall establish an appeals process to resolve disputes from providers

regarding the accuracy of the data used to develop analyses or reports. When a provider appeals
the accuracy of the data used to calculate the peer grouping system results, the provider shall:
    (1) clearly indicate the reason they believe the data used to calculate the peer group system
results are not accurate;
   (2) provide evidence and documentation to support the reason that data was not accurate; and
   (3) cooperate with the commissioner, including allowing the commissioner access to data
necessary and relevant to resolving the dispute.
If a provider does not meet the requirements of this paragraph, a provider's appeal shall be considered
withdrawn. The commissioner shall not publish results for a specific provider under paragraph (e)
or (f) while that provider has an unresolved appeal.
    (e) Beginning January 1, 2011, the commissioner shall, no less than annually, publish
information on providers' total cost, total resource use, total quality, and the results of the total care
portion of the peer grouping process. The results that are published must be on a risk-adjusted basis.
    (f) Beginning March 30, 2011, the commissioner shall no less than annually publish information
on providers' condition-specific cost, condition-specific resource use, and condition-specific quality,

published must be on a risk-adjusted basis.
    (g) Prior to disseminating data to providers under paragraph (b) or (c) or publishing information
under paragraph (e) or (f), the commissioner shall ensure the scientific validity and reliability
of the results according to the standards described in paragraph (h). If additional time is needed
to establish the scientific validity and reliability of the results, the commissioner may delay the
dissemination of data to providers under paragraph (b) or (c), or the publication of information
under paragraph (e) or (f). If the delay is more than 60 days, the commissioner shall report in

In achieving these thresholds, the commissioner shall not aggregate clinics that are not part of the
same system or practice group. The commissioner shall consult with and solicit feedback from
representatives of physician clinics and hospitals during the peer grouping data analysis process to
obtain input on the methodological options prior to final analysis and on the design, development,
and testing of provider reports.

subdivision 3, paragraph (e):
    (1) the commissioner of management and budget shall use the information and methods
developed under subdivision 3 to strengthen incentives for members of the state employee group
insurance program to use high-quality, low-cost providers;
    (2) all political subdivisions, as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 11, that offer health benefits
to their employees must offer plans that differentiate providers on their cost and quality performance
and create incentives for members to use better-performing providers;
    (3) all health plan companies shall use the information and methods developed under subdivision
3 to develop products that encourage consumers to use high-quality, low-cost providers; and
    (4) health plan companies that issue health plans in the individual market or the small employer
market must offer at least one health plan that uses the information developed under subdivision 3 to
establish financial incentives for consumers to choose higher-quality, lower-cost providers through
enrollee cost-sharing or selective provider networks.
    (b) By January 1, 2011, the commissioner of health shall report to the governor and the
legislature on recommendations to encourage health plan companies to promote widespread
adoption of products that encourage the use of high-quality, low-cost providers. The commissioner's
recommendations may include tax incentives, public reporting of health plan performance,
regulatory incentives or changes, and other strategies.

medical assistance program for managed care oversight contracted through vendors, including
consumer surveys, studies, and external quality reviews as required by the federal Balanced Budget
Act of 1997, Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, part 438-managed care, subpart E-external
quality review. Any federal money received for managed care oversight is appropriated to the
commissioner for this purpose. The commissioner may expend the federal money received in either
year of the biennium.
    Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 33. Contingency contract fees. (a) When the commissioner enters into a
contingency-based contract for the purpose of recovering medical assistance or MinnesotaCare
funds, the commissioner may retain that portion of the recovered funds equal to the amount of the
contingency fee.
    (b) Amounts attributed to new recoveries under this subdivision are appropriated to the
commissioner to the extent they fulfill the payment terms of the contract with the vendor and shall
be deposited into an account in a fund other than the general fund for purposes of fulfilling the
terms of the vendor contract.
    Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256.969, subdivision 2b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2b. Operating payment rates. In determining operating payment rates for admissions
occurring on or after the rate year beginning January 1, 1991, and every two years after, or more
frequently as determined by the commissioner, the commissioner shall obtain operating data from
an updated base year and establish operating payment rates per admission for each hospital based on
the cost-finding methods and allowable costs of the Medicare program in effect during the base year.
Rates under the general assistance medical care, medical assistance, and MinnesotaCare programs
shall not be rebased to more current data on January 1, 1997, January 1, 2005, for the first 24 months
of the rebased period beginning January 1, 2009. For the first 24 months of the rebased period
beginning January 1, 2011, rates shall not be rebased, except that a Minnesota long-term hospital
shall be rebased effective January 1, 2011, based on its most recent Medicare cost report ending on
or before September 1, 2008, with the provisions under subdivisions 9 and 23, based on the rates
in effect on December 31, 2010. For subsequent rate setting periods in which the base years are
updated, a Minnesota long-term hospital's base year shall remain within the same period as other
hospitals. E

charge data used to establish operating rates shall only reflect inpatient services covered by medical
assistance and shall not include property cost information and costs recognized in outlier payments.

  Subd. 18. Applications for medical assistance. (a) The state agency may take applications for
medical assistance and conduct eligibility determinations for MinnesotaCare enrollees.
    (b) The commissioner of human services shall modify the Minnesota health care programs
application form to add a question asking applicants whether they have ever served in the United

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2011.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.056, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Asset limitations for individuals and families. ­      (­
                                                                     a­
                                                                      ) To be eligible for medical
assistance, a person must not individually own more than $3,000 in assets, or if a member of a
household with two family members, husband and wife, or parent and child, the household must
not own more than $6,000 in assets, plus $200 for each additional legal dependent. In addition to
these maximum amounts, an eligible individual or family may accrue interest on these amounts,
but they must be reduced to the maximum at the time of an eligibility redetermination. The
accumulation of the clothing and personal needs allowance according to section 256B.35 must
also be reduced to the maximum at the time of the eligibility redetermination. The value of assets
that are not considered in determining eligibility for medical assistance is the value of those assets
excluded under the supplemental security income program for aged, blind, and disabled persons,
with the following exceptions:
   (1) household goods and personal effects are not considered;
   (2) capital and operating assets of a trade or business that the local agency determines are
necessary to the person's ability to earn an income are not considered;
   (3) motor vehicles are excluded to the same extent excluded by the supplemental security income
program;
    (4) assets designated as burial expenses are excluded to the same extent excluded by the
supplemental security income program. Burial expenses funded by annuity contracts or life
insurance policies must irrevocably designate the individual's estate as contingent beneficiary to
the extent proceeds are not used for payment of selected burial expenses; and
    (5) effective upon federal approval, for a person who no longer qualifies as an employed person
with a disability due to loss of earnings, assets allowed while eligible for medical assistance under
section 256B.057, subdivision 9, are not considered for 12 months, beginning with the first month
of ineligibility as an employed person with a disability, to the extent that the person's total assets
remain within the allowed limits of section 256B.057, subdivision 9, paragraph (c).

     ­­) (j) Beginning October 1, 2003, persons who are receiving care and rehabilitation services
from a nonprofit center established to serve victims of torture and are otherwise ineligible for
medical assistance under this chapter are eligible for medical assistance without federal financial
participation. These individuals are eligible only for the period during which they are receiving
services from the center. Individuals eligible under this paragraph shall not be required to participate
in prepaid medical assistance.
   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0625, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 3q. Evidence-based childbirth program. (a) The commissioner shall implement a
program to reduce the number of elective inductions of labor prior to 39 weeks' gestation. In this
subdivision, the term "elective induction of labor" means the use of artificial means to stimulate
labor in a woman without the presence of a medical condition affecting the woman or the child that
makes the onset of labor a medical necessity. The program must promote the implementation of
policies within hospitals providing services to recipients of medical assistance or MinnesotaCare
that prohibit the use of elective inductions prior to 39 weeks' gestation, and adherence to such
policies by the attending providers.

    (b) For all births covered by medical assistance or MinnesotaCare on or after January 1, 2012,
a payment for professional services associated with the delivery of a child in a hospital must not
be made unless the provider has submitted information about the nature of the labor and delivery
including any induction of labor that was performed in conjunction with that specific birth. The
information must be on a form prescribed by the commissioner.
    (c) The requirements in paragraph (b) must not apply to deliveries performed at a hospital that
has policies and processes in place that have been approved by the commissioner which prohibit
elective inductions prior to 39 weeks' gestation. A process for review of hospital induction policies
must be established by the commissioner and review of policies must occur at the discretion of the
commissioner. The commissioner's decision to approve or rescind approval must include verification
and review of items including, but not limited to:
    (1) policies that prohibit use of elective inductions for gestation less than 39 weeks;
    (2) policies that encourage providers to document and communicate with patients a final
expected date of delivery by 20 weeks' gestation that includes data from ultrasound measurements
as applicable;
   (3) policies that encourage patient education regarding elective inductions, and requires
documentation of the processes used to educate patients;
    (4) ongoing quality improvement review as determined by the commissioner; and
    (5) any data that has been collected by the commissioner.
    (d) All hospitals must report annually to the commissioner induction information for all births
that were covered by medical assistance or MinnesotaCare in a format and manner to be established
by the commissioner.
   (e) The commissioner at any time may choose not to implement or may discontinue any or all
aspects of the program if the commissioner is able to determine that hospitals representing at least 90
percent of births covered by medical assistance or MinnesotaCare have approved policies in place.

wholesale acquisition cost plus two percent for all other pharmacies. A pharmacy is "independently
owned" if it is one of four or fewer pharmacies under the same ownership nationally. A "designated
rural area" means an area defined as a small rural area or isolated rural area according to the
four-category classification of the Rural Urban Commuting Area system developed for the United
States Health Resources and Services Administration. Wholesale acquisition cost is defined as the
manufacturer's list price for a drug or biological to wholesalers or direct purchasers in the United
States, not including prompt pay or other discounts, rebates, or reductions in price, for the most
recent month for which information is available, as reported in wholesale price guides or other
publications of drug or biological pricing data. The maximum allowable cost of a multisource drug
may be set by the commissioner and it shall be comparable to, but no higher than, the maximum
amount paid by other third-party payors in this state who have maximum allowable cost programs.
Establishment of the amount of payment for drugs shall not be subject to the requirements of the
Administrative Procedure Act.
    (b) An additional dispensing fee of $.30 may be added to the dispensing fee paid to pharmacists
for legend drug prescriptions dispensed to residents of long-term care facilities when a unit dose
blister card system, approved by the department, is used. Under this type of dispensing system, the
pharmacist must dispense a 30-day supply of drug. The National Drug Code (NDC) from the drug
container used to fill the blister card must be identified on the claim to the department. The unit dose
blister card containing the drug must meet the packaging standards set forth in Minnesota Rules,
part 6800.2700, that govern the return of unused drugs to the pharmacy for reuse. The pharmacy
provider will be required to credit the department for the actual acquisition cost of all unused drugs
that are eligible for reuse. Over-the-counter medications must be dispensed in the manufacturer's
unopened package. The commissioner may permit the drug clozapine to be dispensed in a quantity
that is less than a 30-day supply.

    (e) The commissioner may negotiate lower reimbursement rates for specialty pharmacy
products than the rates specified in paragraph (a). The commissioner may require individuals
enrolled in the health care programs administered by the department to obtain specialty pharmacy
products from providers with whom the commissioner has negotiated lower reimbursement rates.
Specialty pharmacy products are defined as those used by a small number of recipients or recipients
with complex and chronic diseases that require expensive and challenging drug regimens. Examples
of these conditions include, but are not limited to: multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, transplantation,
hepatitis C, growth hormone deficiency, Crohn's Disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and certain forms of

cancer. Specialty pharmaceutical products include injectable and infusion therapies, biotechnology
drugs, antihemophilic factor products, high-cost therapies, and therapies that require complex
care. The commissioner shall consult with the formulary committee to develop a list of specialty
pharmacy products subject to this paragraph. In consulting with the formulary committee in
developing this list, the commissioner shall take into consideration the population served by
specialty pharmacy products, the current delivery system and standard of care in the state, and
access to care issues. The commissioner shall have the discretion to adjust the reimbursement rate
to prevent access to care issues.
    (f) Home infusion therapy services provided by home infusion therapy pharmacies must be paid
at rates according to subdivision 8d.

a recipient with a drug therapy problem that is identified by the commissioner or identified by a
pharmacist and approved by the commissioner; or prior authorized by the commissioner that has
resulted or is likely to result in significant nondrug program costs. The commissioner may cover
medical therapy management services under MinnesotaCare if the commissioner determines this
is cost-effective. For purposes of this subdivision, "medication therapy management" means the
provision of the following pharmaceutical care services by a licensed pharmacist to optimize the
therapeutic outcomes of the patient's medications:
   (1) performing or obtaining necessary assessments of the patient's health status;
   (2) formulating a medication treatment plan;
    (3) monitoring and evaluating the patient's response to therapy, including safety and
effectiveness;
  (4) performing a comprehensive medication review to identify, resolve, and prevent
medication-related problems, including adverse drug events;
   (5) documenting the care delivered and communicating essential information to the patient's
other primary care providers;
   (6) providing verbal education and training designed to enhance patient understanding and
appropriate use of the patient's medications;
   (7) providing information, support services, and resources designed to enhance patient adherence
with the patient's therapeutic regimens; and
   (8) coordinating and integrating medication therapy management services within the broader
health care management services being provided to the patient.
Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to expand or modify the scope of practice of the
pharmacist as defined in section 151.01, subdivision 27.

for reimbursement under this paragraph, the pharmacist providing the services must meet the
requirements of paragraph (b), and must be located within an ambulatory care setting approved by
the commissioner. The patient must also be located within an ambulatory care setting approved by
the commissioner. Services provided under this paragraph may not be transmitted into the patient's
residence.
    (e) The commissioner shall establish a pilot project for an intensive medication therapy
management program for patients identified by the commissioner with multiple chronic conditions
and a high number of medications who are at high risk of preventable hospitalizations, emergency
room use, medication complications, and suboptimal treatment outcomes due to medication-related
problems. For purposes of the pilot project, medication therapy management services may be
provided in a patient's home or community setting, in addition to other authorized settings. The
commissioner may waive existing payment policies and establish special payment rates for the
pilot project. The pilot project must be designed to produce a net savings to the state compared to
the estimated costs that would otherwise be incurred for similar patients without the program. The
pilot project must begin by January 1, 2010, and end June 30, 2012.

persons in obtaining emergency or nonemergency medical care when paid directly to an ambulance
company, common carrier, or other recognized providers of transportation services. Medical
transportation must be provided by:
   (1) an ambulance, as defined in section 144E.001, subdivision 2;
   (2) special transportation; or
    (3) common carrier including, but not limited to, bus, taxicab, other commercial carrier, or
private automobile.
    (b) Medical assistance covers special transportation, as defined in Minnesota Rules, part
9505.0315, subpart 1, item F, if the recipient has a physical or mental impairment that would
prohibit the recipient from safely accessing and using a bus, taxi, other commercial transportation,
or private automobile.
The commissioner may use an order by the recipient's attending physician to certify that the
recipient requires special transportation services. Special transportation providers shall perform
driver-assisted services for eligible individuals. Driver-assisted service includes passenger pickup
at and return to the individual's residence or place of business, assistance with admittance of
the individual to the medical facility, and assistance in passenger securement or in securing of
wheelchairs or stretchers in the vehicle. Special transportation providers must obtain written
documentation from the health care service provider who is serving the recipient being transported,
identifying the time that the recipient arrived. Special transportation providers may not bill
for separate base rates for the continuation of a trip beyond the original destination. Special
transportation providers must take recipients to the nearest appropriate health care provider,
using the most direct route. The minimum medical assistance reimbursement rates for special
transportation services are:
   (1) (i) $17 for the base rate and $1.35 per mile for special transportation services to eligible
persons who need a wheelchair-accessible van;
   (ii) $11.50 for the base rate and $1.30 per mile for special transportation services to eligible
persons who do not need a wheelchair-accessible van; and
    (iii) $60 for the base rate and $2.40 per mile, and an attendant rate of $9 per trip, for special
transportation services to eligible persons who need a stretcher-accessible vehicle;
    (2) the base rates for special transportation services in areas defined under RUCA to be super
rural shall be equal to the reimbursement rate established in clause (1) plus 11.3 percent; and
    (3) for special transportation services in areas defined under RUCA to be rural or super rural
areas:
    (i) for a trip equal to 17 miles or less, mileage reimbursement shall be equal to 125 percent of
the respective mileage rate in clause (1); and
    (ii) for a trip between 18 and 50 miles, mileage reimbursement shall be equal to 112.5 percent
of the respective mileage rate in clause (1).
    (c) For purposes of reimbursement rates for special transportation services under paragraph (b),
the zip code of the recipient's place of residence shall determine whether the urban, rural, or super

rural reimbursement rate applies.
    (d) For purposes of this subdivision, "rural urban commuting area" or "RUCA" means a
census-tract based classification system under which a geographical area is determined to be urban,
rural, or super rural.
    (e) Effective for services provided on or after July 1, 2011, nonemergency transportation rates,
including special transportation, taxi, and other commercial carriers, are reduced 4.5 percent.
Payments made to managed care plans and county-based purchasing plans must be reduced for
services provided on or after January 1, 2012, to reflect this reduction.
   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0625, subdivision 17a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 17a. Payment for ambulance services. (a) Medical assistance covers ambulance services.
Providers shall bill ambulance services according to Medicare criteria. Nonemergency ambulance
services shall not be paid as emergencies. Effective for services rendered on or after July 1, 2001,
medical assistance payments for ambulance services shall be paid at the Medicare reimbursement
rate or at the medical assistance payment rate in effect on July 1, 2000, whichever is greater.
    (b) Effective for services provided on or after July 1, 2011, ambulance services payment rates
are reduced 4.5 percent. Payments made to managed care plans and county-based purchasing plans
must be reduced for services provided on or after January 1, 2012, to reflect this reduction.
   Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0625, subdivision 18, is amended to read:
   Subd. 18. Bus or taxicab transportation. To the extent authorized by rule of the state agency,

incurred by any ambulatory eligible person for obtaining nonemergency medical care.
   Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0625, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 25b. Authorization with third-party liability. (a) Except as otherwise allowed under
this subdivision or required under federal or state regulations, the commissioner must not consider
a request for authorization of a service when the recipient has coverage from a third-party payer
unless the provider requesting authorization has made a good faith effort to receive payment or
authorization from the third-party payer. A good faith effort is established by supplying with the
authorization request to the commissioner the following:
    (1) a determination of payment for the service from the third-party payer, a determination of
authorization for the service from the third-party payer, or a verification of noncoverage of the
service by the third-party payer; and
    (2) the information or records required by the department to document the reason for the
determination or to validate noncoverage from the third-party payer.
    (b) A provider requesting authorization for services covered by Medicare is not required to
bill Medicare before requesting authorization from the commissioner if the provider has reason to
believe that a service covered by Medicare is not eligible for payment. The provider must document
that, because of recent claim experiences with Medicare or because of written communication from
Medicare, coverage is not available for the service.

    (c) Authorization is not required if a third-party payer has made payment that is equal to or
greater than 60 percent of the maximum payment amount for the service allowed under medical
assistance.

covers augmentative and alternative communication systems consisting of electronic or
nonelectronic devices and the related components necessary to enable a person with severe
expressive communication limitations to produce or transmit messages or symbols in a manner
that compensates for that disability.

   Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0625, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 55. Payment for noncovered services. (a) Except when specifically prohibited by the
commissioner or federal law, a provider may seek payment from the recipient for services not
eligible for payment under the medical assistance program when the provider, prior to delivering the
service, reviews and considers all other available covered alternatives with the recipient and obtains
a signed acknowledgment from the recipient of the potential of the recipient's liability. The signed
acknowledgment must be in a form approved by the commissioner.
    (b) Conditions under which a provider must not request payment from the recipient include, but
are not limited to:
  (1) a service that requires prior authorization, unless authorization has been denied as not
medically necessary and all other therapeutic alternatives have been reviewed;
      (2) a service for which payment has been denied for reasons relating to billing requirements;
      (3) standard shipping or delivery and setup of medical equipment or medical supplies;
      (4) services that are included in the recipient's long term care per diem;

   (5) the recipient is enrolled in the Restricted Recipient Program and the provider is one of a
provider type designated for the recipient's health care services; and
    (6) the noncovered service is a prescriptive drug identified by the commissioner as having the
potential for abuse and overuse, except where payment by the recipient is specifically approved by
the commissioner on the date of service based upon compelling evidence supplied by the prescribing
provider that establishes medical necessity for that particular drug.
    (c) The payment requested from recipients for noncovered services under this subdivision must
not exceed the provider's usual and customary charge for the actual service received by the recipient.
A recipient must not be billed for the difference between what medical assistance paid for the service
or would pay for a less costly alternative service.

frequent user is defined as an individual who has frequented the hospital emergency department for
services three or more times in the previous four consecutive months. In-reach community-based
service coordination includes navigating services to address a client's mental health, chemical
health, social, economic, and housing needs, or any other activity targeted at reducing the incidence
of emergency room and other nonmedically necessary health care utilization.
    (b) Reimbursement must be made in 15-minute increments under current Medicaid mental
health social work reimbursement methodology and allowed for up to 60 days posthospital
discharge based upon the specific identified emergency department visit or inpatient admitting
event. A frequent user who is participating in care coordination within a health care home
framework is ineligible for reimbursement under this subdivision. Eligible in-reach service
coordinators must hold a minimum of a bachelor's degree in social work, public health, corrections,
or a related field. The commissioner shall submit any necessary application for waivers to the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to implement this subdivision.
    (c) For the purposes of this subdivision, "in-reach community-based service coordination"
means the practice of a community-based worker with training, knowledge, skills, and ability to
access a continuum of services, including housing, transportation, chemical and mental health
treatment, employment, and peer support services, by working with an organization's staff to
transition an individual back into the individual's living environment. In-reach community-based
service coordination includes working with the individual during their discharge and for up to a
defined amount of time in the individual's living environment, reducing the individual's need for
readmittance.

The commissioner shall establish participation requirements for health maintenance organizations.
The commissioner shall provide lists of participating medical assistance providers on a quarterly
basis to the commissioner of management and budget, the commissioner of labor and industry,
and the commissioner of commerce. Each of the commissioners shall develop and implement
procedures to exclude as participating providers in the program or programs under their jurisdiction
those providers who do not participate in the medical assistance program. The commissioner of

MinnesotaCare patients served by the provider in the aggregate exceed 30 percent of the provider's
overall patient population.
   Sec. 45. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0751, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Alternative models and waivers of requirements. (a) Nothing in this section
shall preclude the continued development of existing medical or health care home projects

enrolled in integrated Medicare and Medicaid programs under section 256B.69, subdivisions 23
and 28, are enrolled in managed care long-term care programs under section 256B.69, subdivision
6b, are dually eligible for Medicare and medical assistance, are in the waiting period for Medicare,
or who have other primary coverage.
    (b) The commissioner of health shall waive health care home certification requirements if
an applicant demonstrates that compliance with a certification requirement will create a major
financial hardship or is not feasible, and the applicant establishes an alternative way to accomplish
the objectives of the certification requirement.
   Sec. 46. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0751, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
   Subd. 8. Coordination with local services. The health care home and the county shall

complex medical needs or a disability, and who need and are eligible for additional local services
administered by counties, including but not limited to waivered services, mental health services,

   Sec. 47. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.69, subdivision 5a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 5a. Managed care contracts. (a) Managed care contracts under this section and section

shall be renewed for the period July 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995 at the same terms that
were in effect on June 30, 1995. The commissioner may issue separate contracts with requirements
specific to services to medical assistance recipients age 65 and older.
   (b) A prepaid health plan providing covered health services for eligible persons pursuant to
chapters 256B and 256L is responsible for complying with the terms of its contract with the
commissioner. Requirements applicable to managed care programs under chapters 256B and
256L established after the effective date of a contract with the commissioner take effect when the
contract is next issued or renewed.
    (c) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2003, the commissioner shall withhold
five percent of managed care plan payments under this section and county-based purchasing plan
payments under section 256B.692 for the prepaid medical assistance program pending completion
of performance targets. Each performance target must be quantifiable, objective, measurable,
and reasonably attainable, except in the case of a performance target based on a federal or state
law or rule. Criteria for assessment of each performance target must be outlined in writing prior
to the contract effective date. The managed care plan must demonstrate, to the commissioner's
satisfaction, that the data submitted regarding attainment of the performance target is accurate.
The commissioner shall periodically change the administrative measures used as performance
targets in order to improve plan performance across a broader range of administrative services. The
performance targets must include measurement of plan efforts to contain spending on health care
services and administrative activities. The commissioner may adopt plan-specific performance
targets that take into account factors affecting only one plan, including characteristics of the plan's
enrollee population. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July of the following
year if performance targets in the contract are achieved. The commissioner may exclude special
demonstration projects under subdivision 23.
    (d) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2009, the
commissioner shall withhold three percent of managed care plan payments under this section and
county-based purchasing plan payments under section 256B.692 for the prepaid medical assistance
program. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the
following year. The commissioner may exclude special demonstration projects under subdivision
23.
    (e) Effective for services provided on or after January 1, 2010, the commissioner shall require
that managed care plans use the assessment and authorization processes, forms, timelines, standards,
documentation, and data reporting requirements, protocols, billing processes, and policies consistent
with medical assistance fee-for-service or the Department of Human Services contract requirements
consistent with medical assistance fee-for-service or the Department of Human Services contract
requirements for all personal care assistance services under section 256B.0659.

county-based purchasing plan payments under section 256B.692 for the prepaid medical assistance
program. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the
following year. The commissioner may exclude special demonstration projects under subdivision
23.
    (g) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2011, the commissioner shall include as
part of the performance targets described in paragraph (c) a reduction in the health plan's emergency
room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees by a measurable rate of five percent from
the plan's utilization rate for state health care program enrollees for the previous calendar year.
    The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of
the following calendar year if the managed care plan demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
commissioner that a reduction in the utilization rate was achieved.
    The withhold described in this paragraph shall continue for each consecutive contract period
until the plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees is reduced
by 25 percent of the plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees
for calendar year 2009. Hospitals shall cooperate with the health plans in meeting this performance
target and shall accept payment withholds that may be returned to the hospitals if the performance
target is achieved. The commissioner shall structure the withhold so that the commissioner returns a
portion of the withheld funds in amounts commensurate with achieved reductions in utilization less
than the targeted amount. The withhold in this paragraph does not apply to county-based purchasing
plans.
    (h) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2012, the commissioner shall
include as part of the performance targets described in paragraph (c) a reduction in the plan's
hospitalization rates or subsequent hospitalizations within 30 days of a previous hospitalization of
a patient regardless of the reason for the hospitalization for state health care program enrollees
by a measurable rate of five percent from the plan's utilization rate for state health care program
enrollees for the previous calendar year.
    The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the
following calendar year if the managed care plan or county-based purchasing plan demonstrates to
the satisfaction of the commissioner that a reduction in the hospitalization rate was achieved.
    The withhold described in this paragraph must continue for each consecutive contract period
until the plan's subsequent hospitalization rate for state health care program enrollees is reduced by
25 percent of the plan's subsequent hospitalization rate for state health care program enrollees for
calendar year 2010. Hospitals shall cooperate with the plans in meeting this performance target and
shall accept payment withholds that must be returned to the hospitals if the performance target is
achieved. The commissioner shall structure the withhold so that the commissioner returns a portion
of the withheld funds in amounts commensurate with achieved reductions in utilization less than
the targeted amount.

    Subd. 5c. Medical education and research fund. (a) The commissioner of human services shall
transfer each year to the medical education and research fund established under section 62J.692, an
amount specified in this subdivision. The commissioner shall calculate the following:
    (1) an amount equal to the reduction in the prepaid medical assistance payments as specified
in this clause. Until January 1, 2002, the county medical assistance capitation base rate prior to
plan specific adjustments and after the regional rate adjustments under subdivision 5b is reduced
6.3 percent for Hennepin County, two percent for the remaining metropolitan counties, and no
reduction for nonmetropolitan Minnesota counties; and after January 1, 2002, the county medical
assistance capitation base rate prior to plan specific adjustments is reduced 6.3 percent for Hennepin
County, two percent for the remaining metropolitan counties, and 1.6 percent for nonmetropolitan
Minnesota counties. Nursing facility and elderly waiver payments and demonstration project
payments operating under subdivision 23 are excluded from this reduction. The amount calculated
under this clause shall not be adjusted for periods already paid due to subsequent changes to the
capitation payments;
      (2) beginning July 1, 2003, $4,314,000 from the capitation rates paid under this section;

     Sec. 49. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.69, subdivision 28, is amended to read:
   Subd. 28. Medicare special needs plans; medical assistance basic health care. (a) The
commissioner may contract with qualified Medicare-approved special needs plans to provide
medical assistance basic health care services to persons with disabilities, including those with
developmental disabilities. Basic health care services include:
    (1) those services covered by the medical assistance state plan except for ICF/MR services,
home and community-based waiver services, case management for persons with developmental
disabilities under section 256B.0625, subdivision 20a, and personal care and certain home care
services defined by the commissioner in consultation with the stakeholder group established under
paragraph (d); and
    (2) basic health care services may also include risk for up to 100 days of nursing facility services
for persons who reside in a noninstitutional setting and home health services related to rehabilitation
as defined by the commissioner after consultation with the stakeholder group.
   The commissioner may exclude other medical assistance services from the basic health care
benefit set. Enrollees in these plans can access any excluded services on the same basis as other
medical assistance recipients who have not enrolled.

    Sec. 50. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.69, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 30. Provider payment rates. (a) Each managed care and county-based plan shall, by
October 1, 2011, array all providers within each provider type, employed by or under contract with
the plan, by their average total annual cost of care for serving medical assistance and MinnesotaCare
enrollees for the most recent reporting year for which data is available, risk-adjusted for enrollee
demographics and health status.
    (b) Beginning January 1, 2012, and each contract year thereafter, each managed care and
county-based purchasing plan shall implement a progressive payment withhold methodology
for each provider type, under which the withhold for a provider increases proportionally as the
59TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                        2385

provider's risk-adjusted total annual cost increases, relative to other providers of the same type.
For purposes of this paragraph, the risk-adjusted total annual cost of care is the dollar amount
calculated under paragraph (a).
    (c) At the end of each contract year, each plan shall array all providers within each provider
type by their average total annual cost of care for serving medical assistance and MinnesotaCare
enrollees for that contract year, risk-adjusted for enrollee demographics and health status. For each
provider whose risk-adjusted total annual cost of care is at or below the 70th percentile of providers
of the same type or specialty, the plan shall return the full amount of any withhold. For each provider
whose risk-adjusted total annual cost of care is above the 70th percentile, the plan shall return only
the portion of the withhold sufficient to bring the provider's payment rate to the average for providers
within the provider type whose risk-adjusted total annual cost of care is at the 70th percentile. Each
plan shall reduce provider payments only as allowed under paragraph (f).
    (d) Each managed care and county-based purchasing plan must establish an appeals process
to allow providers to appeal determinations of risk-adjusted total annual cost of care. Each plan's
appeals process must be approved by the commissioner.
    (e) The commissioner shall require each plan to submit to the commissioner, in the form
and manner specified by the commissioner, all provider payment data and information on the
withhold methodology that the commissioner determines is necessary to verify compliance with
this subdivision.
    (f) The commissioner, for the contract year beginning January 1, 2012, shall reduce plan
capitation rates by ten percent from the rates that would otherwise apply, absent application of
this subdivision. The reduced rate shall be the historical base rate for negotiating capitation rates
for future contract years. The commissioner may recommend additional reductions in capitation
rates for future contract years to the legislature, if the commissioner determines this is necessary to
ensure that health care providers under contract with managed care and county-based purchasing
plans practice in an efficient manner. Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2012,
managed care plans and county-based purchasing plans contracted with the state to administer
the health care programs provided under sections 256B.69, 256B.692, and 256L.12, may reduce
payments made to providers employed or under contract with the plan. However, a managed care
or county-based purchasing plan is prohibited from: (1) reducing payments made to providers
whose risk-adjusted total annual cost of care is at or below the 70th percentile of providers of the
same type or specialty, or at or below the 80th percentile for provider types or specialties currently
subject to plan care management requirements that in the aggregate are more extensive than those
that apply to other provider types or specialties, or for which a majority of services are currently
subject to prior authorization by the plan and (2) reducing payments to hospitals described under
the Social Security Act, title 18, section 1886, subsection (d), paragraph (l), and subparagraph (B),
clause (iii).
    (g) The commissioner of human services, in consultation with the commissioner of health, shall
develop and provide to managed care and county-based purchasing plans, by September 1, 2011,
standard criteria and definitions necessary for consistent calculation of the total annual risk-adjusted
cost of care across plans. The commissioner may use encounter data to implement this subdivision,
and may provide encounter data or analyses to plans.
   (h) For purposes of this subdivision, "provider" means a vendor of medical care as defined

in section 256B.02, subdivision 7, for which sufficient encounter data on utilization and costs is
available to implement this subdivision.
    (i) A managed care or county-based purchasing plan must use the methodology described in
paragraphs (a) to (e), unless the plan develops an alternative model consistent with the purpose of
this subdivision.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 51. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.69, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 32. Health education. The commissioner shall require managed care and county-based
purchasing plans, as a condition of contract, to provide health education, wellness training, and
information about the availability and benefits of preventive services to all medical assistance and
MinnesotaCare enrollees, beginning January 1, 2012. Plan initiatives developed or implemented to
comply with this requirement must be approved by the commissioner.
   Sec. 52. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.76, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Critical access dental providers. (a) Effective for dental services rendered on or after
January 1, 2002, the commissioner shall increase reimbursements to dentists and dental clinics
deemed by the commissioner to be critical access dental providers. For dental services rendered
on or after July 1, 2007, the commissioner shall increase reimbursement by 30 percent above
the reimbursement rate that would otherwise be paid to the critical access dental provider. The
commissioner shall pay the managed care plans and county-based purchasing plans in amounts
sufficient to reflect increased reimbursements to critical access dental providers as approved by the
commissioner.
   (b) The commissioner shall designate the following dentists and dental clinics as critical access
dental providers:
   (1) nonprofit community clinics that:
   (i) have nonprofit status in accordance with chapter 317A;
   (ii) have tax exempt status in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code, section 501(c)(3);
   (iii) are established to provide oral health services to patients who are low income, uninsured,

   (iv) have professional staff familiar with the cultural background of the clinic's patients;
    (v) charge for services on a sliding fee scale designed to provide assistance to low-income
patients based on current poverty income guidelines and family size;
    (vi) do not restrict access or services because of a patient's financial limitations or public
assistance status; and
   (vii) have free care available as needed;
   (2) federally qualified health centers, rural health clinics, and public health clinics;
   (3) county owned and operated hospital-based dental clinics;

must require the academic and research institution selected to demonstrate a proven track record
over at least five years of conducting high-quality, federally funded clinical research. The RFP shall
specify the state costs directly related to the requirements of this section and shall require that the
selected institution pay those costs to the state. The institution and the federally qualified health
centers and federally qualified health center look-alikes shall also:
   (1) provide patient education, provider education, and enrollment training components on health
and lifestyle issues in order to promote enrollee responsibility for health care decisions, enhance
productivity, prepare enrollees to reenter the workforce, and reduce future health care expenditures;

   (2) use high-quality and cost-effective integrated disease management that includes the best
practices of traditional and complementary and alternative medicine;
    (3) incorporate holistic medical care, appropriate nutrition, exercise, medications, and conflict
resolution techniques;
    (4) include a provider education component that makes use of professional organizations
representing chiropractors, nurses, and other primary care providers and provides appropriate
educational materials and activities in order to improve the integration of traditional medical care
with licensed chiropractic services and other alternative health care services and achieve program
enrollment objectives; and
   (5) provide to the commissioner the information and data necessary for the commissioner to
prepare the annual reports required under subdivision 6.
    Subd. 3. Enrollment. Enrollees from the program shall be selected by the commissioner from
current enrollees in the prepaid medical assistance program who have, or are determined to be at
significant risk of developing, neck and back problems. Participation in the demonstration project
shall be voluntary. The commissioner shall seek to enroll, over the term of the demonstration project,
ten percent of current and future medical assistance enrollees who have, or are determined to be at
significant risk of developing, neck and back problems.
   Subd. 4. Federal approval. The commissioner shall seek any federal waivers and approvals
necessary to implement the demonstration project.
     Subd. 5. Project costs. The commissioner shall require the academic and research institution
selected, federally qualified health centers, and federally qualified health center look-alikes to fund
all costs of the demonstration project. Amounts received under subdivision 2 are appropriated to the
commissioner for the purposes of this section.
    Subd. 6. Annual reports. The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of health,
beginning December 15, 2011, and each December 15 thereafter through December 15, 2015, shall
report annually to the legislature on the functional and mental improvements of the populations
served by the demonstration project, patient satisfaction, and the cost-effectiveness of the program.
The reports must also include data on hospital admissions, days in hospital, rates of outpatient
surgery and other services, and drug utilization. The report, due December 15, 2015, must include
recommendations on whether the demonstration project should be continued and expanded.
   Sec. 54. [256B.841] MINNESOTA CHOICE WAIVER APPLICATION AND PROCESS.
   Subdivision 1. Intent. It is the intent of the legislature that medical assistance be:
   (1) a sustainable, cost-effective, person-centered, and opportunity-driven program utilizing
competitive and value-based purchasing to maximize available service options; and
    (2) a results-oriented system of coordinated care that focuses on independence and choice,
promotes accountability and transparency, encourages and rewards healthy outcomes and
responsible choices, and promotes efficiency.
   Subd. 2. Waiver application. (a) By September 1, 2011, the commissioner of human services

   (7) consolidate all home and community-based services currently provided under title XIX of the
federal Social Security Act, United States Code, title 42, section 1915(c), into a single program of
home and community-based services that include options for consumer direction and shared living;

Contracting hospitals or plans shall develop and implement a coordinated care delivery system
to provide health care services to individuals who are eligible for general assistance medical
care under this section and who either choose to receive services through the coordinated care
delivery system or who are enrolled by the commissioner under paragraph (c). The health care
services provided by the system must include: (1) the services described in subdivision 4 with
the exception of outpatient prescription drug coverage but shall include drugs administered in a
clinic or other outpatient setting; or (2) a set of comprehensive and medically necessary health
services that the recipients might reasonably require to be maintained in good health and that has
been approved by the commissioner, including at a minimum, but not limited to, emergency care,
medical transportation services, inpatient hospital and physician care, outpatient health services,
preventive health services, mental health services, and prescription drugs administered in a clinic or
other outpatient setting. Outpatient prescription drug coverage is covered on a fee-for-service basis
in accordance with section 256D.03, subdivision 3, and funded under subdivision 9. A hospital or
plan establishing a coordinated care delivery system under this subdivision must ensure that the
requirements of this subdivision are met.
    (b) A hospital or group of hospitals, or a county-based purchasing plan established under
section 256B.692, may contract with the commissioner to develop and implement a coordinated
care delivery system ­a­

                           1 October 1, January 1, April 1, or July 1. Hospital or plan participation is
effective for a period of 12 months and may be renewed for successive 12-month periods.
    (c) Applicants and recipients may enroll in any available coordinated care delivery system
statewide. If more than one coordinated care delivery system is available, the applicant or recipient
shall be allowed to choose among the systems. The commissioner may assign an applicant or
recipient to a coordinated care delivery system if no choice is made by the applicant or recipient.
The commissioner shall consider a recipient's zip code, city of residence, county of residence,
or distance from a participating coordinated care delivery system when determining default
assignment. An applicant or recipient may decline enrollment in a coordinated care delivery
system but services excluding outpatient prescription drug coverage are only available through a
coordinated care delivery system. Upon enrollment into a coordinated care delivery system, the
recipient must agree to receive all nonemergency services through the coordinated care delivery
system. Enrollment in a coordinated care delivery system is for six months and may be renewed
for additional six-month periods, except that initial enrollment is for six months or until the end
of a recipient's period of general assistance medical care eligibility, whichever occurs first. A                      ­

    (d) The hospital or plan may contract and coordinate with providers and clinics for the delivery
of services and shall contract with essential community providers as defined under section 62Q.19,
subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clauses (1) and (2), to the extent practicable. When contracting with
providers and clinics, the hospital or plan shall give preference to providers and clinics certified
as health care homes under section 256B.0751. The hospital or plan must contract with federally
qualified health centers or federally qualified health center look-alikes, as defined in section
145.9269, subdivision 1, and essential community providers as defined in section 62Q.19, that
agree to accept the terms, conditions, and payment rates offered by the hospital or plan to similarly
situated providers, except that reimbursement to federally qualified health centers and federally
qualified health center look-alikes must comply with federal law. If a provider or clinic or health
center contracts with a hospital or plan to provide services through the coordinated care delivery
system, the provider may not refuse to provide services to any recipient enrolled in the system, and
payment for services shall be negotiated with the hospital or plan and paid by the hospital or plan
from the system's allocation under subdivision 7.
      (e) A coordinated care delivery system must:
    (1) provide the covered services required under paragraph (a) to recipients enrolled in the
coordinated care delivery system, and comply with the requirements of subdivision 4, paragraphs
(b) to (g);
      (2) establish a process to monitor enrollment and ensure the quality of care provided;
    (3) in cooperation with counties, coordinate the delivery of health care services with existing
homeless prevention, supportive housing, and rent subsidy programs and funding administered by
the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency under chapter 462A; and
    (4) adopt innovative and cost-effective methods of care delivery and coordination, which may
include the use of allied health professionals, telemedicine, patient educators, care coordinators, and
community health workers.
    (f) The hospital or plan may require a recipient to designate a primary care provider or a primary
care clinic. The hospital or plan may limit the delivery of services to a network of providers who
have contracted with the hospital or plan to deliver services in accordance with this subdivision, and
require a recipient to seek services only within this network. The hospital or plan may also require a
referral to a provider before the service is eligible for payment. A coordinated care delivery system
is not required to provide payment to a provider who is not employed by or under contract with the
system for services provided to a recipient enrolled in the system, except in cases of an emergency.
For purposes of this section, emergency services are defined in accordance with Code of Federal
Regulations, title 42, section 438.114 (a).
   (g) A recipient enrolled in a coordinated care delivery system has the right to appeal to the
commissioner according to section 256.045.

   (h) The state shall not be liable for the payment of any cost or obligation incurred by the
coordinated care delivery system.
    (i) The hospital or plan must provide the commissioner with data necessary for assessing
enrollment, quality of care, cost, and utilization of services. Each hospital or plan must provide,
on a quarterly basis on a form prescribed by the commissioner for each recipient served by the
coordinated care delivery system, the services provided, the cost of services provided, and the
actual payment amount for the services provided and any other information the commissioner
deems necessary to claim federal Medicaid match. The commissioner must provide this data to the
legislature on a quarterly basis.

      s­, the commissioner shall, as necessary, make the adjustments specified in paragraph (b) to
ensure that expenditures remain within the limits of available revenues for the remainder of the
current biennium and for the following biennium. The commissioner shall not hire additional staff
using appropriations from the health care access fund until the commissioner of management and
budget makes a determination that the adjustments implemented under paragraph (b) are sufficient
to allow MinnesotaCare expenditures to remain within the limits of available revenues for the
remainder of the current biennium and for the following biennium.
    (b) The adjustments the commissioner shall use must be implemented in this order: first, stop
enrollment of single adults and households without children; second, upon 45 days' notice, stop
coverage of single adults and households without children already enrolled in the MinnesotaCare
program; third, upon 90 days' notice, decrease the premium subsidy amounts by ten percent for
families with gross annual income above 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines; fourth, upon
90 days' notice, decrease the premium subsidy amounts by ten percent for families with gross annual
income at or below 200 percent; and fifth, require applicants to be uninsured for at least six months
prior to eligibility in the MinnesotaCare program. If these measures are insufficient to limit the
expenditures to the estimated amount of revenue, the commissioner shall further limit enrollment
or decrease premium subsidies.

    (b) Each new period of eligibility must take into account any changes in circumstances that
impact eligibility and premium amount. An enrollee must provide all the information needed to
redetermine eligibility by the first day of the month that ends the eligibility period. If there is no
change in circumstances, the enrollee may renew eligibility at designated locations that include
community clinics and health care providers' offices. The designated sites shall forward the renewal
forms to the commissioner. The commissioner may establish criteria and timelines for sites to
forward applications to the commissioner or county agencies. The premium for the new period of
eligibility must be received as provided in section 256L.06 in order for eligibility to continue.
    (c) An enrollee who fails to submit renewal forms and related documentation necessary for
verification of continued eligibility in a timely manner shall remain eligible for one additional month
beyond the end of the current eligibility period before being disenrolled. The enrollee remains
responsible for MinnesotaCare premiums for the additional month.

target is accurate. The commissioner shall periodically change the administrative measures used as
performance targets in order to improve plan performance across a broader range of administrative
services. The performance targets must include measurement of plan efforts to contain spending
on health care services and administrative activities. The commissioner may adopt plan-specific
performance targets that take into account factors affecting only one plan, such as characteristics of
the plan's enrollee population. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no
later than July 31 of the following calendar year if performance targets in the contract are achieved.
    (c) For services rendered on or after January 1, 2011, the commissioner shall withhold an

part of the performance targets described in paragraph (b) a reduction in the plan's emergency room
utilization rate for state health care program enrollees by a measurable rate of five percent from the
plan's utilization rate for the previous calendar year.
    The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of
the following calendar year if the managed care plan demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
commissioner that a reduction in the utilization rate was achieved.
    The withhold described in this paragraph shall continue for each consecutive contract period
until the plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees is reduced
by 25 percent of the plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees
for calendar year 2009. Hospitals shall cooperate with the health plans in meeting this performance
target and shall accept payment withholds that may be returned to the hospitals if the performance
target is achieved. The commissioner shall structure the withhold so that the commissioner returns a
portion of the withheld funds in amounts commensurate with achieved reductions in utilization less

until the plan's subsequent hospitalization rate for state health care program enrollees is reduced by
25 percent of the plan's subsequent hospitalization rate for state health care program enrollees for
calendar year 2010. Hospitals shall cooperate with the plans in meeting this performance target and
shall accept payment withholds that must be returned to the hospitals if the performance target is
achieved. The commissioner shall structure the withhold so that the commissioner returns a portion
of the withheld funds in amounts commensurate with achieved reductions in utilizations less than

applicant's or enrollee's refund for the purposes of meeting all or part of the applicant's or enrollee's
MinnesotaCare premium obligation. The applicant or enrollee may authorize the commissioner to

MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS.
    The commissioner of human services shall develop and submit to the legislature by December
15, 2011, a plan to provide care coordination to medical assistance and MinnesotaCare enrollees
who are children with high-cost mental health conditions. For purposes of this section, a child has a
"high-cost mental health condition" if mental health and medical expenses over the past year totalled
$100,000 or more. For purposes of this section, "care coordination" means collaboration between an
advanced practice nurse and primary care physicians and specialists to manage care; development
of mental health management plans for recurrent mental health issues; oversight and coordination
of all aspects of care in partnership with families; organization of medical, treatment, and therapy
information into a summary of critical information; coordination and appropriate sequencing of
evaluations and multiple appointments; information and assistance with accessing resources; and
telephone triage for behavior or other problems.
  Sec. 78. REGULATORY SIMPLIFICATION AND REDUCTION OF PROVIDER
REPORTING AND DATA SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Regulatory simplification and report reduction work group. The
commissioner of management and budget shall convene a regulatory simplification and report
reduction work group of persons designated by the commissioners of health, human services,
and commerce to eliminate redundant, unnecessary, and obsolete state mandated reporting or
data submittal requirements for health care providers or group purchasers related to health care
costs, quality, utilization, access, or patient encounters or related to provider or group purchaser,
monitoring, finances, and regulation. For purposes of this section, the term "health care providers
or group purchasers" has the meaning provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 62J.03, subdivisions
6 and 8, except that it also includes nursing homes.
    Subd. 2. Plan development and other duties. (a) The commissioner of management and budget,
in consultation with the work group, shall develop a plan for regulatory simplification and report
reduction activities of the commissioners of health, human services, and commerce that considers
collection and regulation of the following in a coordinated manner:
   (1) encounter data;
   (2) group purchaser provider network data;
   (3) financial reporting;
   (4) reporting and documentation requirements relating to member communications and
marketing materials;
   (5) state regulation and oversight of group purchasers;
   (6) requirements and procedures for denial, termination, or reduction of services and member
appeals and grievances; and
   (7) state performance improvement projects, requirements, and procedures.
    (b) The commissioners of health, human services, and commerce, following consultation with
the work group, shall present to the legislature by January 1, 2012, proposals to implement their
recommendations.

   Subd. 3. New reporting and other duties. (a) The commissioner of management and budget, in
consultation with the work group and the commissioners of health, human services, and commerce,
shall develop criteria to be used by the commissioners in determining whether to establish new
reporting and data submittal requirements. These criteria must support the establishment of new
reporting and data submittal requirements only:
   (1) if required by a federal agency or state statute;
   (2) if needed for a state regulatory audit or corrective action plan;
   (3) if needed to monitor or protect public health;
   (4) if needed to manage the cost and quality of Minnesota's public health insurance programs; or
    (5) if a review and analysis by the commissioner of the relevant agency has documented the
necessity, importance, and administrative cost of the requirement, and has determined that the
information sought cannot be efficiently obtained through another state or federal report.
    (b) The commissioners of health, human services, and commerce, following consultation with
the work group, may propose to the legislature new provider and group purchaser reporting and
data submittal requirements to take effect on or after July 1, 2012. These proposals shall include an
analysis of the extent to which the requirements meet the criteria developed under paragraph (a).
   Sec. 79. SPECIALIZED MAINTENANCE THERAPY.
    The commissioner of human services shall evaluate whether providing medical assistance
coverage for specialized maintenance therapy for enrollees with serious and persistent mental
illness who are at risk of hospitalization will improve the quality of care and lower medical
assistance spending by reducing rates of hospitalization. The commissioner shall present findings
and recommendations to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees
with jurisdiction over health and human services finance and policy by December 15, 2011.
   Sec. 80. BENEFIT SET OPTIONS.
    The commissioner of human services shall analyze and provide recommendations for state plan
amendments that would provide different benefits for different demographic populations under
the medical assistance program as permitted under federal law, with the goal of tailoring more
cost-effective coverage based on unique needs of the demographic population. The commissioner
shall report these recommendations to the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate and
house health and human services committees by January 15, 2012.
   Sec. 81. REDUCING HOSPITALIZATION RATES.
    The commissioner of human services, by January 15, 2012, shall present recommendations to
the legislature to reduce hospitalization rates for state health care program enrollees who are children
with high-cost medical conditions.
   Sec. 82. MEDICAID FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION.

assistance, claims review, and medical record and documentation investigations, to detect and
investigate improper payments both before and after payments are made.

to apply its analytics and investigations on a subset of data provided by the commissioner to
demonstrate the direct recoveries of the solution.
    Subd. 3. Data confidentiality. Data provided by the commissioner to the vendor under this
section must maintain the confidentiality of the information.
    Subd. 4. Full implementation phase. The request for proposal must require the commissioner
to implement the recommendations provided by the vendor if the work done under the requirements
of subdivision 2 provides recoveries directly related to the investigations to the state. After full
implementation, the vendor shall be paid from recoveries directly attributable to the work done by
the vendor, according to the terms and performance measures negotiated in the contract.
    Subd. 5. Selection of vendor. The commissioner of human services shall select a vendor from
the responses to the request for proposal by January 31, 2012.

diabetes, including but not limited to the use of new wound care technologies, assessment tools,
and reporting programs. The commissioner shall present recommendations by December 15, 2011,
to the legislature on whether these new strategies for wound care treatment should be covered
under medical assistance and MinnesotaCare.
  Sec. 84. PROHIBITION OF STATE FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN FEDERAL
HEALTH CARE REFORMS.

and Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111-148, as amended by the Health Care and Education
Affordability and Reconciliation Act of 2010, Public Law 111-152, and no provisions of the act

   Section 1. [15.996] PERFORMANCE-BASED ORGANIZATIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Designation. The governor may designate one or more programs within the
Department of Human Services and within up to two other executive branch state agencies whose
missions involve people with disabilities as performance-based organizations. The goal of the
performance-based organization designation is to provide the best services in the most cost-effective
59TH DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                      2411

manner to people with disabilities. For a program that is designated as a performance-based
organization, the agency providing services or another governmental or private organization under
contract with the agency may enter into a performance-based agreement that allows the agency
or the entity under contract with the agency more flexibility in its operations in exchange for
a greater level of accountability. With any required legislative approval, a performance-based
organization agreement may exempt an agency or an outside entity providing services from one or
more procedural laws, rules, or policies that otherwise would govern the program.
    Subd. 2. Performance-based organization agreement. Designation of a performance-based
organization must be implemented through a performance-based organization agreement. A
performance-based organization agreement may be between the governor and an agency, if an
agency is to provide services under the agreement, or between an agency and an outside entity, if
the outside entity is to provide the services. A performance-based organization agreement must:
   (1) describe the programs subject to the agreement;
   (2) specify the procedural laws, rules, or policies that will not apply to the performance-based
organization, why waiver or variance from these laws, rules, or policies is necessary to achieve
desired outcomes, and a description of alternative means of accomplishing the purposes of those
laws, rules, or policies;
   (3) contain procedures for oversight of the performance-based organization, including
requirements and procedures for program and financial audits;
   (4) if the performance-based organization involves a nonstate entity, contain provisions
governing assumption of liability, and types and amounts of insurance coverage to be obtained;
   (5) specify the duration of the agreement; and
    (6) specify measurable performance-based outcomes for achieving program goals, time periods
during which these outcomes will be measured and reported, and consequences for not meeting the
performance-based outcomes.
   Subd. 3. Duration; legislative approval; reporting. (a) A performance-based organization
agreement may be up to three years and may be renewed.
    (b) The chief executive of the state agency whose program is subject to a performance-based
organization must report to the chairs and ranking minority members of legislative policy
and finance committees with jurisdiction over the program on the proposed content of the
performance-based organization, and specifically describing any procedural laws, rules, and
policies that will not apply. The legislature must approve a performance-based organization before
the state agency may enter into a performance-based agreement.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 252.27, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Contribution amount. (a) The natural or adoptive parents of a minor child, including
a child determined eligible for medical assistance without consideration of parental income, must
contribute to the cost of services used by making monthly payments on a sliding scale based on
income, unless the child is married or has been married, parental rights have been terminated, or
the child's adoption is subsidized according to section 259.67 or through title IV-E of the Social
Security Act. The parental contribution is a partial or full payment for medical services provided

for diagnostic, therapeutic, curing, treating, mitigating, rehabilitation, maintenance, and personal
care services as defined in United States Code, title 26, section 213, needed by the child with a
chronic illness or disability.
    (b) For households with adjusted gross income equal to or greater than 100 percent of federal
poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall be computed by applying the following schedule
of rates to the adjusted gross income of the natural or adoptive parents:
    (1) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 100 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution is $4
per month;
   (2) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 175 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than or equal to 5

human services which begins at one percent of adjusted gross income at 175 percent of federal
poverty guidelines and increases to ­7­5

    If the child lives with the parent, the annual adjusted gross income is reduced by $2,400 prior
to calculating the parental contribution. If the child resides in an institution specified in section
256B.35, the parent is responsible for the personal needs allowance specified under that section
in addition to the parental contribution determined under this section. The parental contribution is
reduced by any amount required to be paid directly to the child pursuant to a court order, but only
if actually paid.
    (c) The household size to be used in determining the amount of contribution under paragraph (b)
includes natural and adoptive parents and their dependents, including the child receiving services.
Adjustments in the contribution amount due to annual changes in the federal poverty guidelines
shall be implemented on the first day of July following publication of the changes.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (b), "income" means the adjusted gross income of the natural
or adoptive parents determined according to the previous year's federal tax form, except, effective
retroactive to July 1, 2003, taxable capital gains to the extent the funds have been used to purchase
a home shall not be counted as income.
   (e) The contribution shall be explained in writing to the parents at the time eligibility for services

is being determined. The contribution shall be made on a monthly basis effective with the first month
in which the child receives services. Annually upon redetermination or at termination of eligibility, if
the contribution exceeded the cost of services provided, the local agency or the state shall reimburse
that excess amount to the parents, either by direct reimbursement if the parent is no longer required
to pay a contribution, or by a reduction in or waiver of parental fees until the excess amount is
exhausted. All reimbursements must include a notice that the amount reimbursed may be taxable
income if the parent paid for the parent's fees through an employer's health care flexible spending
account under the Internal Revenue Code, section 125, and that the parent is responsible for paying
the taxes owed on the amount reimbursed.
    (f) The monthly contribution amount must be reviewed at least every 12 months; when there
is a change in household size; and when there is a loss of or gain in income from one month to
another in excess of ten percent. The local agency shall mail a written notice 30 days in advance of
the effective date of a change in the contribution amount. A decrease in the contribution amount is
effective in the month that the parent verifies a reduction in income or change in household size.
    (g) Parents of a minor child who do not live with each other shall each pay the contribution
required under paragraph (a). An amount equal to the annual court-ordered child support payment
actually paid on behalf of the child receiving services shall be deducted from the adjusted gross
income of the parent making the payment prior to calculating the parental contribution under
paragraph (b).
    (h) The contribution under paragraph (b) shall be increased by an additional five percent if
the local agency determines that insurance coverage is available but not obtained for the child.
For purposes of this section, "available" means the insurance is a benefit of employment for a
family member at an annual cost of no more than five percent of the family's annual income. For
purposes of this section, "insurance" means health and accident insurance coverage, enrollment
in a nonprofit health service plan, health maintenance organization, self-insured plan, or preferred
provider organization.
    Parents who have more than one child receiving services shall not be required to pay more than
the amount for the child with the highest expenditures. There shall be no resource contribution from
the parents. The parent shall not be required to pay a contribution in excess of the cost of the services
provided to the child, not counting payments made to school districts for education-related services.
Notice of an increase in fee payment must be given at least 30 days before the increased fee is due.
  (i) The contribution under paragraph (b) shall be reduced by $300 per fiscal year if, in the 12
months prior to July 1:
   (1) the parent applied for insurance for the child;
   (2) the insurer denied insurance;
    (3) the parents submitted a complaint or appeal, in writing to the insurer, submitted a complaint
or appeal, in writing, to the commissioner of health or the commissioner of commerce, or litigated
the complaint or appeal; and
   (4) as a result of the dispute, the insurer reversed its decision and granted insurance.
   For purposes of this section, "insurance" has the meaning given in paragraph (h).
2414                                                         JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                                          [59TH DAY

    A parent who has requested a reduction in the contribution amount under this paragraph shall
submit proof in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioner or county agency, including,
but not limited to, the insurer's denial of insurance, the written letter or complaint of the parents,
court documents, and the written response of the insurer approving insurance. The determinations
of the commissioner or county agency under this paragraph are not rules subject to chapter 14.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2012.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0913, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Eligibility for funding for services for nonmedical assistance recipients. (a) Funding
for services under the alternative care program is available to persons who meet the following
criteria:
    (1) the person has been determined by a community assessment under section 256B.0911 to be
a person who would require the level of care provided in a nursing facility, but for the provision of
services under the alternative care program. Effective January 1, 2011, this determination must be
made according to the criteria established in section 144.0724, subdivision 11;
   (2) the person is age 65 or older;
    (3) the person would be eligible for medical assistance within 135 days of admission to a nursing
facility;
    (4) the person is not ineligible for the payment of long-term care services by the medical
assistance program due to an asset transfer penalty under section 256B.0595 or equity interest in
the home exceeding $500,000 as stated in section 256B.056;
   (5) the person needs long-term care services that are not funded through other state or federal
funding, or other health insurance or other third-party insurance such as long-term care insurance;
    (6) except for individuals described in clause (7), the monthly cost of the alternative care services
funded by the program for this person does not exceed 75 percent of the monthly limit described
under section 256B.0915, subdivision 3a. This monthly limit does not prohibit the alternative care
client from payment for additional services, but in no case may the cost of additional services
purchased under this section exceed the difference between the client's monthly service limit defined
under section 256B.0915, subdivision 3, and the alternative care program monthly service limit
defined in this paragraph. If care-related supplies and equipment or environmental modifications
and adaptations are or will be purchased for an alternative care services recipient, the costs may be
prorated on a monthly basis for up to 12 consecutive months beginning with the month of purchase. If
the monthly cost of a recipient's other alternative care services exceeds the monthly limit established
in this paragraph, the annual cost of the alternative care services shall be determined. In this event,

shall be increased annually as described in section 256B.0915, subdivision 3a, paragraph (a). This
monthly limit does not prohibit the alternative care client from payment for additional services,
but in no case may the cost of additional services purchased exceed the difference between the
client's monthly service limit defined in this clause and the limit described in clause (6) for case mix

     (iii) the establishment of greater family involvement in the financial management of payments;
or
     (iv) another method acceptable to the lead agency to ensure prompt fee payments.

the individual is found to be eligible for medical assistance, medical assistance must be billed for
services payable under the federally approved elderly waiver plan and delivered from the date the
individual was found eligible for the federally approved elderly waiver plan. Notwithstanding this
provision, alternative care funds may not be used to pay for any service the cost of which: (i) is
payable by medical assistance; (ii) is used by a recipient to meet a waiver obligation; or (iii) is used
to pay a medical assistance income spenddown for a person who is eligible to participate in the
federally approved elderly waiver program under the special income standard provision.

59TH DAY]                                    WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                                          2427

    (d) Alternative care funding is not available for a person whose income is greater than the
maintenance needs allowance under section 256B.0915, subdivision 1d, but equal to or less than
120 percent of the federal poverty guideline effective July 1 in the fiscal year for which alternative
care eligibility is determined, who would be eligible for the elderly waiver with a waiver obligation.
    Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.0915, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3a. Elderly waiver cost limits. (a) The monthly limit for the cost of waivered services
to an individual elderly waiver client except for individuals described in paragraph (b) shall be the
weighted average monthly nursing facility rate of the case mix resident class to which the elderly
waiver client would be assigned under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, less the
recipient's maintenance needs allowance as described in subdivision 1d, paragraph (a), until the
first day of the state fiscal year in which the resident assessment system as described in section
256B.438 for nursing home rate determination is implemented. Effective on the first day of the state
fiscal year in which the resident assessment system as described in section 256B.438 for nursing
home rate determination is implemented and the first day of each subsequent state fiscal year, the
monthly limit for the cost of waivered services to an individual elderly waiver client shall be the rate
of the case mix resident class to which the waiver client would be assigned under Minnesota Rules,
parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, in effect on the last day of the previous state fiscal year, adjusted

individualized monthly authorized payment for the customized living service plan shall not exceed
50 percent of the greater of either the statewide or any of the geographic groups' weighted average
monthly nursing facility rate of the case mix resident class to which the elderly waiver eligible client
would be assigned under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, less the maintenance
needs allowance as described in subdivision 1d, paragraph (a), until the July 1 of the state fiscal
year in which the resident assessment system as described in section 256B.438 for nursing home
rate determination is implemented. Effective on July 1 of the state fiscal year in which the resident

plan for individuals described in subdivision 3a, paragraph (b), must be the monthly authorized
payment limit for customized living for individuals classified as case mix A, reduced by 25 percent.
This rate limit must be applied to all new participants enrolled in the program on or after July 1,

24-hour customized living services is a monthly rate authorized by the lead agency within the
parameters established by the commissioner of human services. The payment agreement must
delineate the amount of each component service included in each recipient's customized living
service plan. The lead agency shall ensure that there is a documented need within the parameters
established by the commissioner for all component customized living services authorized. The lead
agency shall not authorize 24-hour customized living services unless there is a documented need
for 24-hour supervision.

agency shall ensure that the frequency and mode of supervision of the recipient and the qualifications
of staff providing supervision are described and meet the needs of the recipient.
    (c) The payment rate for 24-hour customized living services must be based on the amount of
component services to be provided utilizing component rates established by the commissioner.
Counties and tribes will use tools issued by the commissioner to develop and document customized
living plans and authorize rates.
  (d) Component service rates must not exceed payment rates for comparable elderly waiver or
medical assistance services and must reflect economies of scale.

the 95 percentile of statewide monthly authorizations for 24-hour customized living services in
effect and in the Medicaid management information systems on March 31, 2009, for each case
mix resident class under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, to which elderly waiver
service clients are assigned. When there are fewer than 50 authorizations in effect in the case mix
resident class, the commissioner shall multiply the calculated service payment rate maximum for
the A classification by the standard weight for that classification under Minnesota Rules, parts
9549.0050 to 9549.0059, to determine the applicable payment rate maximum. Service payment
rate maximums shall be updated annually based on legislatively adopted changes to all service
rates for home and community-based service providers.
    (g) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (f), the commissioner may establish
alternative payment rate systems for 24-hour customized living services in housing with services
establishments which are freestanding buildings with a capacity of 16 or fewer, by applying a single
hourly rate for covered component services provided in either:
   (1) licensed corporate adult foster homes; or
   (2) specialized dementia care units which meet the requirements of section 144D.065 and in
which:
   (i) each resident is offered the option of having their own apartment; or
    (ii) the units are licensed as board and lodge establishments with maximum capacity of eight
residents, and which meet the requirements of Minnesota Rules, part 9555.6205, subparts 1, 2, 3,

  Sec. 25. [256B.0961] STATE QUALITY ASSURANCE, QUALITY IMPROVEMENT,
AND LICENSING SYSTEM.
    Subdivision 1. Scope. (a) In order to improve the quality of services provided to Minnesotans
with disabilities and to meet the requirements of the federally approved home and community-based
waivers under section 1915c of the Social Security Act, a State Quality Assurance, Quality
Improvement, and Licensing System for Minnesotans receiving disability services is enacted. This
system is a partnership between the Department of Human Services and the State Quality Council
established under subdivision 3.
    (b) This system is a result of the recommendations from the Department of Human Services'
licensing and alternative quality assurance study mandated under Laws 2005, First Special Session
chapter 4, article 7, section 57, and presented to the legislature in February 2007.
   (c) The disability services eligible under this section include:
    (1) the home and community-based services waiver programs for persons with developmental
disabilities under section 256B.092, subdivision 4, or section 256B.49, including traumatic brain
injuries and services for those who qualify for nursing facility level of care or hospital facility level
of care;
   (2) home care services under section 256B.0651;
   (3) family support grants under section 252.32;
   (4) consumer support grants under section 256.476;
   (5) semi-independent living services under section 252.275; and
   (6) services provided through an intermediate care facility for the developmentally disabled.
   (d) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
   (1) "commissioner" means the commissioner of human services;

    Subd. 2. Duties of the commissioner of human services. (a) The commissioner of human
services shall establish the State Quality Council under subdivision 3.
    (b) The commissioner shall initially delegate authority to perform licensing functions and
activities according to section 245A.16 to a host county in Region 10. The commissioner must
not license or reimburse a participating facility, program, or service located in Region 10 if the
commissioner has received notification from the host county that the facility, program, or service
2436                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [59TH DAY

has failed to qualify for licensure.
    (c) The commissioner may conduct random licensing inspections based on outcomes adopted
under section 256B.0951, subdivision 3, at facilities or programs, and of services eligible under
this section. The role of the random inspections is to verify that the system protects the safety and
well-being of persons served and maintains the availability of high-quality services for persons with
disabilities.
    (d) The commissioner shall ensure that the federal home and community-based waiver
requirements are met and that incidents that may have jeopardized safety and health or violated
services-related assurances, civil and human rights, and other protections designed to prevent
abuse, neglect, and exploitation, are reviewed, investigated, and acted upon in a timely manner.
    (e) The commissioner shall seek a federal waiver by July 1, 2012 to allow intermediate care
facilities for persons with developmental disabilities to participate in this system.
    Subd. 3. State Quality Council. (a) There is hereby created a State Quality Council which must
define regional quality councils, and carry out a community-based, person-directed quality review
component, and a comprehensive system for effective incident reporting, investigation, analysis,
and follow-up.
    (b) By August 1, 2011, the commissioner of human services shall appoint the members of the
initial State Quality Council. Members shall include representatives from the following groups:
   (1) disability service recipients and their family members;
    (2) during the first two years of the State Quality Council, there must be at least three members
from the Region 10 stakeholders. As regional quality councils are formed under subdivision 4, each
regional quality council shall appoint one member;
   (3) disability service providers;
   (4) disability advocacy groups; and
  (5) county human services agencies and staff from the Department of Human Services and
Ombudsman for Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities.
   (c) Members of the council who do not receive a salary or wages from an employer for time spent
on council duties may receive a per diem payment when performing council duties and functions.
   (d) The State Quality Council shall:
    (1) assist the Department of Human Services in fulfilling federally mandated obligations by
monitoring disability service quality and quality assurance and improvement practices in Minnesota;
and
    (2) establish state quality improvement priorities with methods for achieving results and provide
an annual report to the legislative committees with jurisdiction over policy and funding of disability
services on the outcomes, improvement priorities, and activities undertaken by the commission
during the previous state fiscal year.
   (e) The State Quality Council, in partnership with the commissioner, shall:

    (1) approve and direct implementation of the community-based, person-directed system
established in this section;
    (2) recommend an appropriate method of funding this system, and determine the feasibility of
the use of Medicaid, licensing fees, as well as other possible funding options;
   (3) approve measurable outcomes in the areas of health and safety, consumer evaluation,
education and training, providers, and systems;
      (4) establish variable licensure periods not to exceed three years based on outcomes achieved;
and
   (5) in cooperation with the Quality Assurance Commission, design a transition plan for licensed
providers from Region 10 into the alternative licensing system by July 1, 2013.
   (f) The State Quality Council shall notify the commissioner of human services that a facility,
program, or service has been reviewed by quality assurance team members under subdivision 4,
paragraph (b), clause (13), and qualifies for a license.
    (g) The State Quality Council, in partnership with the commissioner, shall establish an ongoing
review process for the system. The review shall take into account the comprehensive nature of the
system which is designed to evaluate the broad spectrum of licensed and unlicensed entities that
provide services to persons with disabilities. The review shall address efficiencies and effectiveness
of the system.
    (h) The State Quality Council may recommend to the commissioner certain variances from the
standards governing licensure of programs for persons with disabilities in order to improve the
quality of services so long as the recommended variances do not adversely affect the health or
safety of persons being served or compromise the qualifications of staff to provide services.
   (i) The safety standards, rights, or procedural protections referenced under subdivision 2,
paragraph (c), shall not be varied. The State Quality Council may make recommendations to the
commissioner or to the legislature in the report required under paragraph (c) regarding alternatives
or modifications to the safety standards, rights, or procedural protections referenced under
subdivision 2, paragraph (c).
      (j) The State Quality Council may hire staff to perform the duties assigned in this subdivision.

  (4) county human services agencies and staff from the Department of Human Services and
Ombudsman for Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities.
      (b) Each regional quality council shall:
2438                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [59TH DAY

    (1) direct and monitor the community-based, person-directed quality assurance system in this
section;
   (2) approve a training program for quality assurance team members under clause (13);
    (3) review summary reports from quality assurance team reviews and make recommendations
to the State Quality Council regarding program licensure;
   (4) make recommendations to the State Quality Council regarding the system;
    (5) resolve complaints between the quality assurance teams, counties, providers, persons
receiving services, their families, and legal representatives;
    (6) analyze and review quality outcomes and critical incident data reporting incidents of life
safety concerns immediately to the Department of Human Services licensing division;
   (7) provide information and training programs for persons with disabilities and their families

responsibilities consistent with the priorities of the State Quality Council; and
    (13) recruit, train, and assign duties to members of quality assurance teams, taking into account

the team members to complete the process, and ensure that no team member has a financial,
personal, or family relationship with the facility, program, or service being reviewed or with
anyone served at the facility, program, or service. Quality assurance teams must be comprised of
county staff, persons receiving services or the person's families, legal representatives, members of
advocacy organizations, providers, and other involved community members. Team members must
complete the training program approved by the regional quality council and must demonstrate
performance-based competency. Team members may be paid a per diem and reimbursed for
expenses related to their participation in the quality assurance process.
    (c) The commissioner shall monitor the safety standards, rights, and procedural protections for
the monitoring of psychotropic medications and those identified under sections 245.825; 245.91
to 245.97; 245A.09, subdivision 2, paragraph (c), clauses (2) and (5); 245A.12; 245A.13; 252.41,

include an evaluation of a random sample of persons served. The sample must be representative of
each service provided. The sample size must be at least five percent but not less than two persons
served. All persons must be given the opportunity to be included in the quality assurance process
in addition to those chosen for the random sample.
    (g) A facility, program, or service may contest a licensing decision of the regional quality council
as permitted under chapter 245A.
    Subd. 5. Annual survey of service recipients. The commissioner, in consultation with the
State Quality Council, shall conduct an annual independent statewide survey of service recipients,
randomly selected, to determine the effectiveness and quality of disability services. The survey
must be consistent with the system performance expectations of the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) Quality Framework. The survey must analyze whether desired outcomes
for persons with different demographic, diagnostic, health, and functional needs, who are receiving

     Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.434, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Alternate rates for nursing facilities. (a) For nursing facilities which have their
payment rates determined under this section rather than section 256B.431, the commissioner shall
establish a rate under this subdivision. The nursing facility must enter into a written contract with
the commissioner.
    (b) A nursing facility's case mix payment rate for the first rate year of a facility's contract under
this section is the payment rate the facility would have received under section 256B.431.
    (c) A nursing facility's case mix payment rates for the second and subsequent years of a
facility's contract under this section are the previous rate year's contract payment rates plus an
inflation adjustment and, for facilities reimbursed under this section or section 256B.431, an
adjustment to include the cost of any increase in Health Department licensing fees for the facility
taking effect on or after July 1, 2001. The index for the inflation adjustment must be based on the
change in the Consumer Price Index-All Items (United States City average) (CPI-U) forecasted
by the commissioner of management and budget's national economic consultant, as forecasted in
the fourth quarter of the calendar year preceding the rate year. The inflation adjustment must be
based on the 12-month period from the midpoint of the previous rate year to the midpoint of the
rate year for which the rate is being determined. For the rate years beginning on July 1, 1999, July

the rate adjustment under this paragraph shall be suspended. Beginning in 2005, adjustment to the
property payment rate under this section and section 256B.431 shall be effective on October 1. In
determining the amount of the property-related payment rate adjustment under this paragraph, the
commissioner shall determine the proportion of the facility's rates that are property-related based
on the facility's most recent cost report.
    (d) The commissioner shall develop additional incentive-based payments of up to five percent
above a facility's operating payment rate for achieving outcomes specified in a contract. The
commissioner may solicit contract amendments and implement those which, on a competitive
basis, best meet the state's policy objectives. The commissioner shall limit the amount of any
incentive payment and the number of contract amendments under this paragraph to operate the
incentive payments within funds appropriated for this purpose. The contract amendments may
specify various levels of payment for various levels of performance. Incentive payments to facilities
under this paragraph may be in the form of time-limited rate adjustments or onetime supplemental
payments. In establishing the specified outcomes and related criteria, the commissioner shall
consider the following state policy objectives:
   (1) successful diversion or discharge of residents to the residents' prior home or other
community-based alternatives;
     (2) adoption of new technology to improve quality or efficiency;
     (3) improved quality as measured in the Nursing Home Report Card;
     (4) reduced acute care costs; and
     (5) any additional outcomes proposed by a nursing facility that the commissioner finds desirable.
    (e) Notwithstanding the threshold in section 256B.431, subdivision 16, facilities that take action
to come into compliance with existing or pending requirements of the life safety code provisions or
federal regulations governing sprinkler systems must receive reimbursement for the costs associated
with compliance if all of the following conditions are met:
   (1) the expenses associated with compliance occurred on or after January 1, 2005, and before
December 31, 2008;
   (2) the costs were not otherwise reimbursed under subdivision 4f or section 144A.071 or
144A.073; and
    (3) the total allowable costs reported under this paragraph are less than the minimum threshold
established under section 256B.431, subdivision 15, paragraph (e), and subdivision 16.
The commissioner shall use money appropriated for this purpose to provide to qualifying nursing
facilities a rate adjustment beginning October 1, 2007, and ending September 30, 2008. Nursing
facilities that have spent money or anticipate the need to spend money to satisfy the most recent life
safety code requirements by (1) installing a sprinkler system or (2) replacing all or portions of an

existing sprinkler system may submit to the commissioner by June 30, 2007, on a form provided by
the commissioner the actual costs of a completed project or the estimated costs, based on a project
bid, of a planned project. The commissioner shall calculate a rate adjustment equal to the allowable
costs of the project divided by the resident days reported for the report year ending September 30,
2006. If the costs from all projects exceed the appropriation for this purpose, the commissioner shall
allocate the money appropriated on a pro rata basis to the qualifying facilities by reducing the rate
adjustment determined for each facility by an equal percentage. Facilities that used estimated costs
when requesting the rate adjustment shall report to the commissioner by January 31, 2009, on the
use of this money on a form provided by the commissioner. If the nursing facility fails to provide the
report, the commissioner shall recoup the money paid to the facility for this purpose. If the facility
reports expenditures allowable under this subdivision that are less than the amount received in the
facility's annualized rate adjustment, the commissioner shall recoup the difference.
      Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.437, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Planned closure rate adjustment. (a) The commissioner of human services shall
calculate the amount of the planned closure rate adjustment available under subdivision 3, paragraph
(b), for up to 5,140 beds according to clauses (1) to (4):
      (1) the amount available is the net reduction of nursing facility beds multiplied by $2,080;
   (2) the total number of beds in the nursing facility or facilities receiving the planned closure rate
adjustment must be identified;
      (3) capacity days are determined by multiplying the number determined under clause (2) by 365;
and
   (4) the planned closure rate adjustment is the amount available in clause (1), divided by capacity
days determined under clause (3).
    (b) A planned closure rate adjustment under this section is effective on the first day of the month
following completion of closure of the facility designated for closure in the application and becomes
part of the nursing facility's total operating payment rate.
    (c) Applicants may use the planned closure rate adjustment to allow for a property payment for
a new nursing facility or an addition to an existing nursing facility or as an operating payment rate
adjustment. Applications approved under this subdivision are exempt from other requirements for
moratorium exceptions under section 144A.073, subdivisions 2 and 3.
   (d) Upon the request of a closing facility, the commissioner must allow the facility a closure rate
adjustment as provided under section 144A.161, subdivision 10.
    (e) A facility that has received a planned closure rate adjustment may reassign it to another
facility that is under the same ownership at any time within three years of its effective date. The
amount of the adjustment shall be computed according to paragraph (a).
    (f) If the per bed dollar amount specified in paragraph (a), clause (1), is increased, the
commissioner shall recalculate planned closure rate adjustments for facilities that delicense beds
under this section on or after July 1, 2001, to reflect the increase in the per bed dollar amount. The
recalculated planned closure rate adjustment shall be effective from the date the per bed dollar
amount is increased.

   (g) For planned closures approved after June 30, 2009, the commissioner of human services
shall calculate the amount of the planned closure rate adjustment available under subdivision 3,
paragraph (b), according to paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (4).
    (h) Beginning July 16, 2011, the commissioner shall no longer accept applications for planned
closure rate adjustments under subdivision 3.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.441, subdivision 50a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 50a. Determination of proximity adjustments. (a) For a nursing facility located in close
proximity to another nursing facility of the same facility group type but in a different peer group
and that has higher limits for care-related or other operating costs, the commissioner shall adjust the
limits in accordance with clauses (1) to (4):
   (1) determine the difference between the limits;
   (2) determine the distance between the two facilities, by the shortest driving route. If the distance
exceeds 20 miles, no adjustment shall be made;
   (3) subtract the value in clause (2) from 20 miles, divide by 20, and convert to a percentage; and
    (4) increase the limits for the nursing facility with the lower limits by the value determined in
clause (1) multiplied by the value determined in clause (3).
   (b) Effective October 1, 2011, nursing facilities located no more than one-quarter mile from
a peer group with higher limits under either subdivision 50 or 51, may receive an operating rate
adjustment. The operating payment rates of a lower-limit peer group facility must be adjusted to be
equal to those of the nearest facility in a higher-limit peer group if that facility's RUG rate with a
weight of 1.00 is higher than the lower-limit peer group facility. Peer groups are those defined in
subdivision 30. The nearest facility must be determined by the most direct driving route.
   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.441, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 61. Rate increase for low-rate facilities. Effective October 1, 2011, operating payment
rates of all nursing facilities that are reimbursed under this section or section 256B.434 shall be
increased for a resource utilization group rate with a weight of 1.00 by up to 2.45 percent, but not to
exceed for the same resource utilization group weight the rate of the facility at the 18th percentile
of all nursing facilities in the state. The percentage of the operating payment rate for each facility
to be case-mix adjusted shall be equal to the percentage that is case-mix adjusted in that facility's
operating payment rate on the preceding September 30.
   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.48, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Prohibited practices. A nursing facility is not eligible to receive medical
assistance payments unless it refrains from all of the following:
                                                                ­.

approved by the state agency for medical assistance recipients as determined by the prospective
desk audit rate, except under the following circumstances:

    (­
     2­) (ii) charge for special services which are not included in the daily rate if medical assistance
residents are charged separately at the same rate for the same services in addition to the daily rate
paid by the commissioner;
    (2) effective July 1, 2011, through September 30, 2012, nursing facilities may charge private
paying residents rates up to two percent higher than the allowable medical assistance payment rate
determined by the commissioner for the RUGS group currently assigned to the resident; and
    (3) effective for rate years beginning October 1, 2012, and after, nursing facilities may
charge private paying residents rates greater than the allowable medical assistance payment rate
determined by the commissioner for the RUGS group currently assigned to the resident by up to
two percent more than the differential in effect on the prior September 30. Nothing in this section
precludes a nursing facility from charging a rate allowable under the facility's single room election
option under Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0060, subpart 11, or the enhanced rates under section
256B.431, subdivision 32. Services covered by the payment rate must be the same regardless of
payment source. Special services, if offered, must be available to all residents in all areas of the
nursing facility and charged separately at the same rate. Residents are free to select or decline
special services. Special services must not include services which must be provided by the nursing
facility in order to comply with licensure or certification standards and that if not provided would
result in a deficiency or violation by the nursing facility. Services beyond those required to comply
with licensure or certification standards must not be charged separately as a special service if they
were included in the payment rate for the previous reporting year. A nursing facility that charges
a private paying resident a rate in violation of this ­     c­a

awarded shall include three times the payments that result from the violation, together with costs
and disbursements, including reasonable ­     a­t

paying resident or the resident's legal representative, the state, subdivision or agency, or a nursing
facility may request a hearing to determine the allowed rate or rates at issue in the cause of action.
Within 15 calendar days after receiving a request for such a hearing, the commissioner shall request
assignment of an administrative law judge under sections 14.48 to 14.56 to conduct the hearing as
soon as possible or according to agreement by the parties. The administrative law judge shall issue
a report within 15 calendar days following the close of the hearing. The prohibition set forth in

donation, or other consideration not otherwise required as payment under the state plan. For
residents on medical assistance, medical assistance payments according to the state plan must be
accepted as payment in full for continued stay, except where otherwise provided for under statute;

   (4) requiring a third-party guarantee of payment to the facility as a condition of admission,
expedited admission, or continued stay in the facility.
Nothing in this paragraph would prohibit discharge for nonpayment of services in accordance with
state and federal regulations.
    (c) Requiring any resident of the nursing facility to utilize a vendor of health care services chosen
by the nursing facility. A nursing facility may require a resident to use pharmacies that utilize unit
dose packing systems approved by the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy, and may require a resident
to use pharmacies that are able to meet the federal regulations for safe and timely administration
of medications such as systems with specific number of doses, prompt delivery of medications, or
access to medications on a 24-hour basis. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, nursing
facilities shall not restrict a resident's choice of pharmacy because the pharmacy utilizes a specific
system of unit dose drug packing.
    (d) Providing differential treatment on the basis of status with regard to public assistance.
     (e) Discriminating in admissions, services offered, or room assignment on the basis of status
with regard to public assistance ­  o­r­r­

    The collection and use by a nursing facility of financial information of any applicant pursuant

facility is utilizing that information for any purpose prohibited by this paragraph.
    (f) Requiring any vendor of medical care as defined by section 256B.02, subdivision 7, who
is reimbursed by medical assistance under a separate fee schedule, to pay any amount based on
utilization or service levels or any portion of the vendor's fee to the nursing facility except as payment
for renting or leasing space or equipment or purchasing support services from the nursing facility as
limited by section 256B.433. All agreements must be disclosed to the commissioner upon request
of the commissioner. Nursing facilities and vendors of ancillary services that are found to be in
violation of this provision shall each be subject to an action by the state of Minnesota or any of
its subdivisions or agencies for treble civil damages on the portion of the fee in excess of that
allowed by this provision and section 256B.433. Damages awarded must include three times the
excess payments together with costs and disbursements including reasonable attorney's fees or their
equivalent.

    (h) For a period not to exceed 180 days, the commissioner may continue to make medical
assistance payments to a nursing facility or boarding care home which is in violation of this section
if extreme hardship to the residents would result. In these cases the commissioner shall issue an
order requiring the nursing facility to correct the violation. The nursing facility shall have 20 days
from its receipt of the order to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within the
20-day period the commissioner may reduce the payment rate to the nursing facility by up to 20
percent. The amount of the payment rate reduction shall be related to the severity of the violation
and shall remain in effect until the violation is corrected. The nursing facility or boarding care
home may appeal the commissioner's action pursuant to the provisions of chapter 14 pertaining to
contested cases. An appeal shall be considered timely if written notice of appeal is received by the
commissioner within 20 days of notice of the commissioner's proposed action.
    In the event that the commissioner determines that a nursing facility is not eligible for
reimbursement for a resident who is eligible for medical assistance, the commissioner may
authorize the nursing facility to receive reimbursement on a temporary basis until the resident can
be relocated to a participating nursing facility.
   Certified beds in facilities which do not allow medical assistance intake on July 1, 1984, or after
shall be deemed to be decertified for purposes of section 144A.071 only.

    Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.49, subdivision 14, is amended to read:
    Subd. 14. Assessment and reassessment. (a) Assessments of each recipient's strengths,
informal support systems, and need for services shall be completed within 20 working days of the
recipient's request as provided in section 256B.0911. Reassessment of each recipient's strengths,
support systems, and need for services shall be conducted at least every 12 months and at other
times when there has been a significant change in the recipient's functioning.
    (b) There must be a determination that the client requires a hospital level of care or a nursing
facility level of care as defined in section 144.0724, subdivision 11, at initial and subsequent
assessments to initiate and maintain participation in the waiver program.
    (c) Regardless of other assessments identified in section 144.0724, subdivision 4, as appropriate
to determine nursing facility level of care for purposes of medical assistance payment for nursing
facility services, only face-to-face assessments conducted according to section 256B.0911,
subdivisions 3a, 3b, and 4d, that result in a hospital level of care determination or a nursing facility
level of care determination must be accepted for purposes of initial and ongoing access to waiver
services payment.
    (d) Persons with developmental disabilities who apply for services under the nursing facility
level waiver programs shall be screened for the appropriate level of care according to section
256B.092.
   (e) Recipients who are found eligible for home and community-based services under this section

continue to meet all other eligibility factors.
    (f) The commissioner shall develop criteria to identify recipients whose level of functioning is
reasonably expected to improve and reassess these recipients to establish a baseline assessment.
Recipients who meet these criteria must have a comprehensive transitional service plan developed
under subdivision 15, paragraphs (b) and (c), and be reassessed every six months until there has
been no significant change in the recipient's functioning for at least 12 months. After there has
been no significant change in the recipient's functioning for at least 12 months, reassessments of
the recipient's strengths, informal support systems, and need for services shall be conducted at least
every 12 months and at other times when there has been a significant change in the recipient's
functioning. Counties, case managers, and service providers are responsible for conducting these
reassessments and shall complete the reassessments out of existing funds.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2012, except for paragraph (f), which
is effective July 1, 2013.

    (b) In developing the comprehensive transitional service plan, the individual receiving services,
the case manager, and the guardian, if applicable, will identify the transitional service plan
fundamental service outcome and anticipated timeline to achieve this outcome. Within the first
20 days following a recipient's request for an assessment or reassessment, the transitional service
planning team must be identified. A team leader must be identified who will be responsible for
assigning responsibility and communicating with team members to ensure implementation of the
transition plan and ongoing assessment and communication process. The team leader should be an
individual, such as the case manager or guardian, who has the opportunity to follow the recipient
to the next level of service.
    Within ten days following an assessment, a comprehensive transitional service plan must
be developed incorporating elements of a comprehensive functional assessment and including
short-term measurable outcomes and timelines for achievement of and reporting on these outcomes.
Functional milestones must also be identified and reported according to the timelines agreed upon
by the transitional service planning team. In addition, the comprehensive transitional service plan
must identify additional supports that may assist in the achievement of the fundamental service
outcome such as the development of greater natural community support, increased collaboration
among agencies, and technological supports.
     The timelines for reporting on functional milestones will prompt a reassessment of services
provided, the units of services, rates, and appropriate service providers. It is the responsibility of
the transitional service planning team leader to review functional milestone reporting to determine
if the milestones are consistent with observable skills and that milestone achievement prompts any
needed changes to the comprehensive transitional service plan.
    For those whose fundamental transitional service outcome involves the need to procure housing,
a plan for the recipient to seek the resources necessary to secure the least restrictive housing possible
should be incorporated into the plan, including employment and public supports such as housing
access and shelter needy funding.
    (c) Counties and other agencies responsible for funding community placement and ongoing
community supportive services are responsible for the implementation of the comprehensive
transitional service plans. Oversight responsibilities include both ensuring effective transitional
service delivery and efficient utilization of funding resources.
    (d) Following one year of transitional services, the transitional services planning team will make
a determination as to whether or not the individual receiving services requires the current level of
continuous and consistent support in order to maintain the recipient's current level of functioning.
Recipients who are determined to have not had a significant change in functioning for 12 months
must move from a transitional to a maintenance service plan. Recipients on a maintenance service

plan must be reassessed to determine if the recipient would benefit from a transitional service plan at
least every 12 months and at other times when there has been a significant change in the recipient's
functioning. This assessment should consider any changes to technological or natural community
supports.

     ­­) (e) When a county is evaluating denials, reductions, or terminations of home and
community-based services under section 256B.49 for an individual, the case manager shall offer
to meet with the individual or the individual's guardian in order to discuss the prioritization of
service needs within the individualized service plan, comprehensive transitional service plan, or
maintenance service plan. The reduction in the authorized services for an individual due to changes
in funding for waivered services may not exceed the amount needed to ensure medically necessary
services to meet the individual's health, safety, and welfare.

Indian tribes to support the projects. The commissioner may waive existing state rules as needed
to accomplish the projects. Notwithstanding section 626.556, the commissioner may authorize
projects to use alternative methods of investigating and assessing reports of child maltreatment,
provided that the projects comply with the provisions of section 626.556 dealing with the rights
of individuals who are subjects of reports or investigations, including notice and appeal rights
and data practices requirements. The commissioner may seek any federal approvals necessary to
carry out the projects as well as seek and use any funds available to the commissioner, including
use of federal funds, foundation funds, existing grant funds, and other funds. The commissioner
is authorized to advance state funds as necessary to operate the projects. Federal reimbursement
applicable to the projects is appropriated to the commissioner for the purposes of the projects.
The projects must be required to address responsibility for safety, permanency, and well-being of
children.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, "American Indian child" means a person under 18 years of
age who is a tribal member or eligible for membership in one of the tribes chosen for a project under
this subdivision and who is residing on the reservation of that tribe.
   (c) In order to qualify for an American Indian child welfare project, a tribe must:
   (1) be one of the existing tribes with reservation land in Minnesota;
   (2) have a tribal court with jurisdiction over child custody proceedings;
2464                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [59TH DAY

   (3) have a substantial number of children for whom determinations of maltreatment have
occurred;
      (4) have capacity to respond to reports of abuse and neglect under section 626.556;
      (5) provide a wide range of services to families in need of child welfare services; and
      (6) have a tribal-state title IV-E agreement in effect.
   (d) Grants awarded under this section may be used for the nonfederal costs of providing child
welfare services to American Indian children on the tribe's reservation, including costs associated
with:
      (1) assessment and prevention of child abuse and neglect;
      (2) family preservation;
      (3) facilitative, supportive, and reunification services;
      (4) out-of-home placement for children removed from the home for child protective purposes;
and
    (5) other activities and services approved by the commissioner that further the goals of providing
safety, permanency, and well-being of American Indian children.
    (e) When a tribe has initiated a project and has been approved by the commissioner to assume
child welfare responsibilities for American Indian children of that tribe under this section, the
affected county social service agency is relieved of responsibility for responding to reports of
abuse and neglect under section 626.556 for those children during the time within which the tribal
project is in effect and funded. The commissioner shall work with tribes and affected counties to
develop procedures for data collection, evaluation, and clarification of ongoing role and financial
responsibilities of the county and tribe for child welfare services prior to initiation of the project.
Children who have not been identified by the tribe as participating in the project shall remain the
responsibility of the county. Nothing in this section shall alter responsibilities of the county for law
enforcement or court services.
    (f) Participating tribes may conduct children's mental health screenings under section 245.4874,
subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (14), for children who are eligible for the initiative and living
on the reservation and who meet one of the following criteria:
      (1) the child must be receiving child protective services;
      (2) the child must be in foster care; or
      (3) the child's parents must have had parental rights suspended or terminated.
Tribes may access reimbursement from available state funds for conducting the screenings. Nothing
in this section shall alter responsibilities of the county for providing services under section 245.487.
    (g) Participating tribes may establish a local child mortality review panel. In establishing a local
child mortality review panel, the tribe agrees to conduct local child mortality reviews for child deaths
or near-fatalities occurring on the reservation under subdivision 12. Tribes with established child
mortality review panels shall have access to nonpublic data and shall protect nonpublic data under
59TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                        2465

subdivision 12, paragraphs (c) to (e). The tribe shall provide written notice to the commissioner and
affected counties when a local child mortality review panel has been established and shall provide
data upon request of the commissioner for purposes of sharing nonpublic data with members of the
state child mortality review panel in connection to an individual case.
    (h) The commissioner shall collect information on outcomes relating to child safety, permanency,
and well-being of American Indian children who are served in the projects. Participating tribes must
provide information to the state in a format and completeness deemed acceptable by the state to meet
state and federal reporting requirements.
    (i) In consultation with the White Earth Band, the commissioner shall develop and submit to
the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees with jurisdiction over health
and human services a plan to transfer legal responsibility for providing child protective services
to White Earth Band member children residing in Hennepin County to the White Earth Band. The
plan shall include a financing proposal, definitions of key terms, statutory amendments required,
and other provisions required to implement the plan. The commissioner shall submit the plan by
January 15, 2012.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.69, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 30. Provision of required materials in alternative formats. (a) For the purposes of this
subdivision, "alternative format" means a medium other than paper and "prepaid health plan" means
managed care plans and county-based purchasing plans.
    (b) A prepaid health plan may provide in an alternative format a provider directory and
certificate of coverage, or materials otherwise required to be available in writing under Code of
Federal Regulations, title 42, section 438.10, or under the commissioner's contract with the prepaid
health plan, if the following conditions are met:
    (1) the prepaid health plan, local agency, or commissioner, as applicable, informs the enrollee
that:
   (i) an alternative format is available and the enrollee affirmatively requests of the prepaid health
plan that the provider directory, certificate of coverage, or materials otherwise required under Code
of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 438.10, or under the commissioner's contract with the
prepaid health plan be provided in an alternative format; and
    (ii) a record of the enrollee request is retained by the prepaid health plan in the form of written
direction from the enrollee or a documented telephone call followed by a confirmation letter to the
enrollee from the prepaid health plan that explains that the enrollee may change the request at any
time;
   (2) the materials are sent to a secure electronic mailbox and are made available at a
password-protected secure electronic Web site or on a data storage device if the materials contain
enrollee data that is individually identifiable;
  (3) the enrollee is provided a customer service number on the enrollee's membership card that
may be called to request a paper version of the materials provided in an alternative format; and
   (4) the materials provided in an alternative format meets all other requirements of the

2466                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [59TH DAY

"Required time frames for distribution" must permit sufficient time for prepaid health plans to
distribute materials in alternative formats upon receipt of enrollees' requests for the materials.
    (c) A prepaid health plan may provide in an alternative format its primary care network list to
the commissioner and to local agencies within its service area. The commissioner or local agency,
as applicable, shall inform a potential enrollee of the availability of a prepaid health plan's primary
care network list in an alternative format. If the potential enrollee requests an alternative format of
the prepaid health plan's primary care network list, a record of that request shall be retained by the
commissioner or local agency. The potential enrollee is permitted to withdraw the request at any
time.
    The prepaid health plan shall submit sufficient paper versions of the primary care network list
to the commissioner and to local agencies within its service area to accommodate potential enrollee
requests for paper versions of the primary care network list.
    (d) A prepaid health plan may provide in an alternative format materials otherwise required to
be available in writing under Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 438.10, or under the
commissioner's contract with the prepaid health plan, if the conditions of paragraphs (b), (c), and
(e), are met for persons who are eligible for enrollment in managed care.
    (e) The commissioner shall seek any federal Medicaid waivers within 90 days after the effective
date of this subdivision that are necessary to provide alternative formats of required material to
enrollees of prepaid health plans as authorized under this subdivision.
   (f) The commissioner shall consult with managed care plans, county-based purchasing plans,
counties, and other interested parties to determine how materials required to be made available to
enrollees under Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 438.10, or under the commissioner's
contract with a prepaid health plan may be provided in an alternative format on the basis that the
enrollee has not opted in to receive the alternative format. The commissioner shall consult with
managed care plans, county-based purchasing plans, counties, and other interested parties to develop
recommendations relating to the conditions that must be met for an opt-out process to be granted.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256D.09, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Recovery of overpayments. (a) If an amount of general assistance or family general
assistance is paid to a recipient in excess of the payment due, it shall be recoverable by the
county agency. The agency shall give written notice to the recipient of its intention to recover the
overpayment.
    (b) Except as provided for interim assistance in section 256D.06, subdivision 5, when an
overpayment occurs, the county agency shall recover the overpayment from a current recipient by
reducing the amount of aid payable to the assistance unit of which the recipient is a member, for
one or more monthly assistance payments, until the overpayment is repaid. All county agencies in
the state shall reduce the assistance payment by three percent of the assistance unit's standard of
need in nonfraud cases and ten percent where fraud has occurred, or the amount of the monthly
payment, whichever is less, for all overpayments.
   (c) In cases when there is both an overpayment and underpayment, the county agency shall offset
one against the other in correcting the payment.
   (d) Overpayments may also be voluntarily repaid, in part or in full, by the individual, in addition
59TH DAY]                              WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                                 2467

to the aid reductions provided in this subdivision, to include further voluntary reductions in the grant
level agreed to in writing by the individual, until the total amount of the overpayment is repaid.
    (e) The county agency shall make reasonable efforts to recover overpayments to persons no
longer on assistance under standards adopted in rule by the commissioner of human services. The
county agency need not attempt to recover overpayments of less than $35 paid to an individual no
longer on assistance if the individual does not receive assistance again within three years, unless the
individual has been convicted of violating section 256.98.
    (f) Establishment of an overpayment is limited to 12 months prior to the month of discovery due
to agency error and six years prior to the month of discovery due to client error or an intentional
program violation determined under section 256.046.
    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256D.49, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Overpayment of monthly grants and recovery of ATM errors. (a) When the
county agency determines that an overpayment of the recipient's monthly payment of Minnesota
supplemental aid has occurred, it shall issue a notice of overpayment to the recipient. If the person
is no longer receiving Minnesota supplemental aid, the county agency may request voluntary
repayment or pursue civil recovery. If the person is receiving Minnesota supplemental aid, the
county agency shall recover the overpayment by withholding an amount equal to three percent of
the standard of assistance for the recipient or the total amount of the monthly grant, whichever is
less.
   (b) Establishment of an overpayment is limited to 12 months from the date of discovery due to
agency error. Establishment of an overpayment is limited to six years prior to the month of discovery
due to client error or an intentional program violation determined under section 256.046.
    (c) For recipients receiving benefits via electronic benefit transfer, if the overpayment is a result
of an automated teller machine (ATM) dispensing funds in error to the recipient, the agency may
recover the ATM error by immediately withdrawing funds from the recipient's electronic benefit
transfer account, up to the amount of the error.

overpayment due to agency, client, or ATM error, or due to assistance received while an appeal is
pending and the participant or former participant is determined ineligible for assistance or for less
assistance than was received, the county agency must recoup or recover the overpayment using the

    (1) reconstruct each affected budget month and corresponding payment month;
    (2) use the policies and procedures that were in effect for the payment month; and
    (3) do not allow employment disregards in section 256J.21, subdivision 3 or 4, in the calculation

commissioner of human services, the supervision of the commissioner as specified in section
256.01, and all federal laws and regulations. The commissioner of human services shall monitor

    (b) On July 1 of each year, the commissioner of human services shall determine a statewide
and county-by-county food stamp program participation rate. The commissioner may designate a
different agency to administer the food stamp program in a county if the agency administering
the program fails to increase the food stamp program participation rate among families or eligible
individuals, or comply with all federal laws and regulations governing the food stamp program.
The commissioner shall review agency performance annually to determine compliance with this
paragraph.

15 of each year starting January 15, 2011, the steering committee shall report its recommendations
to the governor and legislative committees with jurisdiction over health and human services. As
part of its report, the steering committee shall, as appropriate, recommend statutory provisions,
rules and requirements, and reports that should be repealed or eliminated.
    (c) As far as possible, the performance measures, reporting system, and funding shall be
consistent across program areas. The development of performance measures shall consider the
manner in which data will be collected and performance will be reported. The steering committee
shall consider state and local administrative costs related to collecting data and reporting outcomes
when developing performance measures. T            ­h­­

committee shall also identify and incorporate federal performance measures in its recommendations
for those program areas where federal funding is contingent on meeting federal performance
standards. The steering committee shall take into consideration that the goal of implementing
changes to program monitoring and reporting the progress toward achieving outcomes is to
significantly minimize the cost of administrative requirements and to allow funds freed by reduced
administrative expenditures to be used to provide additional services, allow flexibility in service
design and management, and focus energies on achieving program and client outcomes.
     (d) In making its recommendations, the steering committee shall consider input from the
council established in section 402A.20. T             ­­h­

service delivery authorities.
    Subd. 3. Program evaluation. By December 15, 2014, the council shall request consideration
by the legislative auditor for a reevaluation under section 3.971, subdivision 7, of those aspects of
the program evaluation of human services administration reported in January 2007 affected by this
chapter.
   Sec. 13. [402A.35] DESIGNATION OF SERVICE DELIVERY AUTHORITY.
    Subdivision 1. Requirements for establishing a service delivery authority. (a) A county, tribe,
or consortium of counties is eligible to establish a service delivery authority if:
   (1) the county, tribe, or consortium of counties is:
   (i) a single county with a population of 55,000 or more;
   (ii) a consortium of counties with a total combined population of 55,000 or more;
    (iii) a consortium of four or more counties in reasonable geographic proximity without regard
to population; or
   (iv) one or more tribes with a total combined population of 25,000 or more.
    The council may recommend that the commissioner of human services exempt a single county,
tribe, or consortium of counties from the minimum population standard if the county, tribe, or
consortium of counties can demonstrate that it can otherwise meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (b) A service delivery authority shall:
    (1) comply with current state and federal law, including any existing federal or state performance
measures and performance measures under section 402A.15 when they are enacted into law,
except where waivers are approved by the commissioner. Nothing in this subdivision requires the
establishment of performance measures under section 402A.15 prior to a service delivery authority
participating in the service delivery redesign under this chapter;
    (2) define the scope of essential services over which the service delivery authority has
jurisdiction;
    (3) designate a single administrative structure to oversee the delivery of those services included
in a proposal for a redesigned service or services and identify a single administrative agent for
purposes of contact and communication with the department;
   (4) identify the waivers from statutory or rule program requirements that are needed to ensure
greater local control and flexibility to determine the most cost-effective means of achieving specified
measurable goals that the participating service delivery authority is expected to achieve;
59TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                         2475

   (5) set forth a reasonable level of targeted reductions in overhead and administrative costs for
each service delivery authority participating in the service delivery redesign;
    (6) set forth the terms under which a county, tribe, or consortium of counties may withdraw from
participation. In the case of withdrawal of any or all parties or the dissolution of the service delivery
authority, the employees shall continue to be represented by the same exclusive representative or
representatives and continue to be covered by the same collective bargaining union agreement until
a new agreement is negotiated or the collective bargaining agreement term ends; and
    (7) set forth a structure for managing the terms and conditions of employment of the employees
as provided in section 402A.40.
    (c) Once a county, tribe, or consortium of counties establishes a service delivery authority, no
county, tribe, or consortium of counties that is a member of the service delivery authority may
participate as a member of any other service delivery authority. The service delivery authority may
allow an additional county, a tribe, or a consortium of counties to join the service delivery authority
subject to the approval of the council and the commissioner.
    (d) Nothing in this chapter precludes local governments from using sections 465.81 and 465.82 to
establish procedures for local governments to merge, with the consent of the voters. Nothing in this
chapter limits the authority of a county board or tribal council to enter into contractual agreements
for services not covered by the provisions of a memorandum of understanding establishing a service
delivery authority with other agencies or with other units of government.
    Subd. 2. Relief from statutory requirements. (a) Unless otherwise identified in the
memorandum of understanding, any county, tribe, or consortium of counties forming a service
delivery authority is exempt from the provisions of sections 245.465; 245.4835; 245.4874; 245.492,
subdivision 2; 245.4932; 256F.13; 256J.626, subdivision 2, paragraph (b); and 256M.30.
    (b) This subdivision does not preclude any county, tribe, or consortium of counties forming a
service delivery authority from requesting additional waivers from statutory and rule requirements
to ensure greater local control and flexibility.
   Subd. 3. Duties. The service delivery authority shall:
    (1) within the scope of essential services set forth in the memorandum of understanding
establishing the authority, carry out the responsibilities required of local agencies under chapter
393 and human services boards under chapter 402;
    (2) manage the public resources devoted to human services and other public services delivered
or purchased by the counties or tribes that are subsidized or regulated by the Department of Human
Services under chapters 245 to 261;
   (3) employ staff to assist in carrying out its duties;
    (4) develop and maintain a continuity of operations plan to ensure the continued operation or
resumption of essential human services functions in the event of any business interruption according
to local, state, and federal emergency planning requirements;
   (5) receive and expend funds received for the redesign process under the memorandum of
understanding;
2476                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [59TH DAY

   (6) plan and deliver services directly or through contract with other governmental, tribal, or
nongovernmental providers;
    (7) rent, purchase, sell, and otherwise dispose of real and personal property as necessary to carry
out the redesign; and
   (8) carry out any other service designated as a responsibility of a county.
    Subd. 4. Process for establishing a service delivery authority. (a) The county, tribe, or
consortium of counties meeting the requirements of section 402A.30 and proposing to establish a
service delivery authority shall present to the council:
    (1) in conjunction with the commissioner, a proposed memorandum of understanding meeting
the requirements of subdivision 1, paragraph (b), and outlining:
   (i) the details of the proposal;
   (ii) the state, tribal, and local resources, which may include, but are not limited to, funding,
administrative and technology support, and other requirements necessary for the service delivery
authority; and
    (iii) the relief available to the service delivery authority if the resource commitments identified
in item (ii) are not met; and
    (2) a board resolution from the board of commissioners of each participating county stating the
county's intent to participate, or in the case of a tribe, a resolution from tribal government, stating
the tribe's intent to participate.
   (b) After the council has considered and recommended approval of a proposed memorandum of
understanding, the commissioner may finalize and execute the memorandum of understanding.
    Subd. 5. Commissioner authority to seek waivers. The commissioner may use the authority
under section 256.01, subdivision 2, paragraph (l), to grant waivers identified as part of a proposed
service delivery authority under subdivision 1, paragraph (b), clause (4), except that waivers granted
under this section must be approved by the council under section 402A.20 rather than the Legislative
Advisory Committee.
   Sec. 14. [402A.40] TRANSITION TO NEW BARGAINING UNIT STRUCTURE.
    Subdivision 1. Application of section. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 179A.12
or any other law, this section governs, where contrary to other law, the initial certification and
decertification, if any, of exclusive representatives for service delivery authorities. Employees of
a service delivery authority are public employees under section 179A.03, subdivision 14. Service
delivery authorities are public employers under section 179A.03, subdivision 15.
    Subd. 2. Existing majority. The commissioner of the Minnesota Bureau of Mediation
Services shall certify an employee organization for employees of a service delivery authority as
exclusive representative for an appropriate unit upon a petition filed with the commissioner by
the organization demonstrating that the petitioner is certified pursuant to section 179A.12 as the
exclusive representative of a majority of the employees included within the unit as of that date. Two
or more employee organizations that represent the employees in a unit may petition jointly under
this subdivision, provided that any organization may withdraw from a joint certification in favor of
59TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                         2477

the remaining organizations on 30 days' notice to the remaining organizations, the employer, and
the commissioner, without affecting the rights and obligations of the remaining organizations or
the employer. The commissioner shall make a determination on a timely petition within 45 days
of its receipt.
    Subd. 3. No existing majority. (a) If no exclusive representative is certified under subdivision
2, the commissioner shall certify an employee organization as exclusive representative for an
appropriate unit established upon a petition filed by the organization within the time period
provided in subdivision 2 demonstrating that the petitioner is certified under section 179A.12
as the exclusive representative of fewer than a majority of the employees included within the
unit if no other employee organization so certified has filed a petition within the time period
provided in subdivision 2 and a majority of the employees in the unit are represented by
employee organizations under section 179A.12 on the date of the petition. Two or more employee
organizations, each of which represents employees included in the unit may petition jointly under
this paragraph, provided that any organization may withdraw from a joint certification in favor of
the remaining organizations on 30 days' notice to the remaining organizations, the employer, and
the commissioner without affecting the rights and obligations of the remaining organizations or the
employer. The commissioner shall make a determination on a timely petition within 45 days of its
receipt.
    (b) If no exclusive representative is certified under paragraph (a) or subdivision 2, and an
employee organization petitions the commissioner within 90 days of the creation of the service
delivery authority demonstrating that a majority of the employees included within an appropriate
unit wish to be represented by the petitioner, where this majority is evidenced by current dues
deduction rights, signed statements from employees in counties within the service delivery
authority that are not currently represented by any employee organization plainly indicating that
the signatories wish to be represented for collective bargaining purposes by the petitioner rather
than by any other organization, or a combination of those, the commissioner shall certify the
petitioner as exclusive representative of the employees in the unit. The commissioner shall make a
determination on a timely petition within 45 days of its receipt.
    (c) If no exclusive representative is certified under paragraph (a) or (b) or subdivision 2, and an
employee organization petitions the commissioner subsequent to the creation of the service delivery
authority demonstrating that at least 30 percent of the employees included within an appropriate
unit wish to be represented by the petitioner, where this 30 percent is evidenced by current
dues deduction rights, signed statements from employees in counties within the service delivery
authority that are not currently represented by any employee organization plainly indicating that
the signatories wish to be represented for collective bargaining purposes by the petitioner rather
than by any other organization, or a combination of those, the commissioner shall conduct a secret
ballot election to determine the wishes of the majority. The election must be conducted within 45
days of receipt or final decision on any petitions filed pursuant to subdivision 2, whichever is later.
The election is governed by section 179A.12, where not inconsistent with other provisions of this
section.
    Subd. 4. Decertification. The commissioner may not consider a petition for decertification of
an exclusive representative certified under this section for one year after certification, unless section
179A.20, subdivision 6, applies.
   Subd. 5. Continuing contract. (a) The terms and conditions of collective bargaining agreements
2478                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [59TH DAY

covering the employees of service delivery authorities remain in effect until a successor agreement
becomes effective or, if no employee organization petitions to represent the employees of the service
delivery authority, until six months after the establishment of the service delivery authority.
    (b) Any accrued leave, including but not limited to sick leave, vacation time, compensatory
leave or paid time off, or severance pay benefits accumulated under policies of the previously
employing county or a collective bargaining agreement between the previously employing county
and an exclusive representative shall continue to apply in the newly created service delivery
authority for the employees of the previously employing county. An employee who was eligible
for the benefits of the Family and Medical Leave Act at the previously employing county shall
continue to be eligible at the newly created service delivery authority.
    (c) If it is necessary, prior to the negotiation of a new collective bargaining agreement, to lay
off an employee of a service delivery authority and if two or more employees previously performed
the work, seniority based on continuous length of service with a service delivery authority member
county shall be the determining factor in determining which qualified employee shall be offered the
job by the service delivery authority. An employee whose work is being transferred to the service
delivery authority shall have the option of being laid off.
    Subd. 6. Contract and representation responsibilities. (a) The exclusive representatives
of units of employees certified prior to the creation of the service delivery authority remain
responsible for administration of their contracts and for other contractual duties and have the
right to dues and fair share fee deduction and other contractual privileges and rights until a
contract is agreed upon with the service delivery authority. Exclusive representatives of service
delivery authority employees certified after the creation of the service delivery authority are
immediately upon certification responsible for bargaining on behalf of employees within the unit.
They are also responsible for administering grievances arising under previous contracts covering
employees included within the unit that remain unresolved upon agreement with the service
delivery authority on a contract. Where the employer does not object, these responsibilities may
be varied by agreement between the outgoing and incoming exclusive representatives. All other
rights and duties of representation begin upon the creation of a service delivery authority, except
that exclusive representatives certified upon or after the creation of the service delivery authority
shall immediately, upon certification, have the right to all employer information and all forms of
access to employees within the bargaining unit which would be permitted to the current contract
holder, including the rights in section 179A.07, subdivision 6. This section does not affect an
existing collective bargaining contract. Incoming exclusive representatives are immediately, upon
certification, responsible for bargaining on behalf of all previously unrepresented employees
assigned to their units.
    (b) Nothing in this section prevents an exclusive representative certified after the effective dates
of these provisions from assessing fair share or dues deductions immediately upon certification if
the employees were unrepresented for collective bargaining purposes before that certification.
   Sec. 15. COUNTY ELECTRONIC VERIFICATION PROCEDURES.
    The commissioner of human services shall define which public assistance program requirements
may be electronically verified for the purposes of determining eligibility, and shall also define
procedures for electronic verification. The commissioner of human services shall report back to
the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees with jurisdiction over these
59TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                       2479

issues by January 15, 2012, with draft legislation to implement the procedures if legislation is
necessary for purposes of implementation.
   Sec. 16. ALIGNMENT OF PROGRAM POLICY AND PROCEDURES.
    The commissioner of human services, in consultation with counties and other key stakeholders,
shall analyze and develop recommendations to align program policy and procedures across
all public assistance programs to simplify and streamline program eligibility and access. The
commissioner shall report back to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative
committees with jurisdiction over these issues by January 15, 2013, with draft legislation to
implement the recommendations.
   Sec. 17. ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES FOR CERTAIN REDETERMINATIONS.
   The commissioner of human services shall develop and implement by January 15, 2012, a
simplified process to redetermine eligibility for recipient populations in the medical assistance,
Minnesota supplemental aid, food support, and group residential housing programs who are eligible
based upon disability, age, or chronic medical conditions, and who are expected to experience
minimal change in income or assets from month to month. The commissioner shall apply for any
federal waivers needed to implement this section.
   Sec. 18. SIMPLIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT PROCESS.
    (a) The commissioner of human services shall issue a request for information for an integrated
service delivery system for health care programs, food support, cash assistance, and child
care. The commissioner shall determine, in consultation with partners in paragraph (c), if the
products meet departments' and counties' functions. The request for information may incorporate
a performance-based vendor financing option in which the vendor shares the risk of the project's
success. The health care system must be developed in phases with the capacity to integrate
food support, cash assistance, and child care programs as funds are available. The request for
information must require that the system:
   (1) streamline eligibility determinations and case processing to support statewide eligibility
processing;
    (2) enable interested persons to determine eligibility for each program, and to apply for programs
online in a manner that the applicant will be asked only those questions relevant to the programs for
which the person is applying;
   (3) leverage technology that has been operational in other state environments with similar
requirements; and
    (4) include Web-based application, worker application processing support, and the opportunity
for expansion.
    (b) The commissioner shall issue a final report, including the implementation plan, to the chairs
and ranking minority members of the legislative committees with jurisdiction over health and human
services no later than October 31, 2011.
   (c) The commissioner shall partner with counties, a service delivery authority established under
Minnesota Statutes, chapter 402A, the Office of Enterprise Technology, other state agencies, and
2480                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [59TH DAY

service partners to develop an integrated service delivery framework, which will simplify and
streamline human services eligibility and enrollment processes. The primary objectives for the
simplification effort include significantly improved eligibility processing productivity resulting in
reduced time for eligibility determination and enrollment, increased customer service for applicants
and recipients of services, increased program integrity, and greater administrative flexibility.
   (d) The commissioner, along with a county representative appointed by the Association of
Minnesota Counties, shall report specific implementation progress to the legislature annually
beginning May 15, 2012.
    (e) The commissioner shall work with the Minnesota Association of County Social Service
Administrators and the Office of Enterprise Technology to develop collaborative task forces, as
necessary, to support implementation of the service delivery components under this paragraph. The
commissioner must evaluate, develop, and include as part of the integrated eligibility and enrollment
service delivery framework, the following minimum components:
   (1) screening tools for applicants to determine potential eligibility as part of an online application
process;
    (2) the capacity to use databases to electronically verify application and renewal data as required
by law;
   (3) online accounts accessible by applicants and enrollees;
   (4) an interactive voice response system, available statewide, that provides case information for
applicants, enrollees, and authorized third parties;
   (5) an electronic document management system that provides electronic transfer of all
documents required for eligibility and enrollment processes; and
    (6) a centralized customer contact center that applicants, enrollees, and authorized third parties
can use statewide to receive program information, application assistance, and case information,
report changes, make cost-sharing payments, and conduct other eligibility and enrollment
transactions.
    (f) Subject to a legislative appropriation, the commissioner of human services shall issue a
request for proposal for the appropriate phase of an integrated service delivery system for health
care programs, food support, cash assistance, and child care.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 19. WHITE EARTH BAND OF OJIBWE HUMAN SERVICES PROJECT.
    (a) The commissioner of human services, in consultation with the White Earth Band of Ojibwe,
shall transfer legal responsibility to the tribe for providing human services to tribal members and
their families who reside on or off the reservation in Mahnomen County. The transfer shall include:
   (1) financing, including federal and state funds, grants, and foundation funds; and
    (2) services to eligible tribal members and families defined as it applies to state programs being
transferred to the tribe.
59TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                       2481

    (b) The determination as to which programs will be transferred to the tribe and the timing of the
transfer of the programs shall be made by a consensus decision of the governing body of the tribe
and the commissioner. The commissioner shall waive existing rules and seek all federal approvals
and waivers as needed to carry out the transfer.
    (c) When the commissioner approves transfer of programs and the tribe assumes responsibility
under this section, Mahnomen County is relieved of responsibility for providing program services
to tribal members and their families who live on or off the reservation while the tribal project is in
effect and funded, except that a family member who is not a White Earth member may choose to
receive services through the tribe or the county. The commissioner shall have authority to redirect
funds provided to Mahnomen County for these services, including administrative expenses, to the
White Earth Band of Ojibwe Indians.
    (d) Upon the successful transfer of legal responsibility for providing human services for
tribal members and their families who reside on and off the reservation in Mahnomen County,
the commissioner and the White Earth Band of Ojibwe shall develop a plan to transfer legal

year, with one or more estimated payment due dates in the same fiscal year in which the revenue
loss occurred, and a final payment in the following fiscal year, conditions constituting delinquency,
interest rates, and a method for computing interest due. Interest is payable from July 1 of the taxable
year on final payments made in the following fiscal year. Calculation of compensation under the
agreement must specify if the revenue loss is determined before or after the allowance of each state's
credit for taxes paid to the other state.

     e­) (f) If an agreement cannot be reached as to the amount of the loss, the commissioner of
revenue and the taxing official of the state of Wisconsin shall each appoint a member of a board of
arbitration and these members shall appoint the third member of the board. The board shall select one
of its members as chair. Such board may administer oaths, take testimony, subpoena witnesses, and
require their attendance, require the production of books, papers and documents, and hold hearings
at such places as are deemed necessary. The board shall then make a determination as to the amount
to be paid the other state which determination shall be final and conclusive.

taxing official of the state of Wisconsin, a member of the board of arbitration, or a consultant under
joint contract with the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin for the purpose of making a determination
as to the amount to be paid the other state under the provisions of this section. Prior to the release
of any information under the provisions of this section, the person to whom the information is to be
released shall sign an agreement which provides that the person will protect the confidentiality of
the returns and information revealed thereby to the extent that it is protected under the laws of the
state of Minnesota.
    (h) Any reciprocity agreement entered into under this section continues in effect until terminated
by Minnesota or Wisconsin law. The commissioner may agree to modify the timing or method of
calculating the state payments to be made under the agreement, consistent with the requirements of
paragraphs (c) and (e), but may not terminate the agreement.
    Subd. 2. New reciprocity agreement with Wisconsin. (a) The commissioner of revenue is
directed to initiate negotiations with the secretary of revenue of Wisconsin, with the objective of
entering into an income tax reciprocity agreement effective for tax years beginning after December
31, 2011. The agreement must satisfy the conditions of subdivision 1, with one or more estimated
payment due dates and a final payment due date specified so that the state with a net revenue loss as
a result of the agreement receives estimated payments from the other state, in the same fiscal year as
that in which the net revenue loss occurred and a final payment with interest in the following fiscal
year.
   (b) The commissioner may not enter into an income tax reciprocity agreement with Wisconsin
under this section until after Wisconsin has paid in full with interest the amount due to Minnesota
under the income tax reciprocity agreement in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1,
2010.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. Subdivision 2 is effective the day following final enactment. The changes
to subdivision 1 are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31 of the year of the
agreement, contingent upon agreement from the state of Wisconsin to a reciprocity arrangement in

be added to federal taxable income:
   (1)(i) interest income on obligations of any state other than Minnesota or a political or
governmental subdivision, municipality, or governmental agency or instrumentality of any state
other than Minnesota exempt from federal income taxes under the Internal Revenue Code or any
other federal statute; and
   (ii) exempt-interest dividends as defined in section 852(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code,
except:
    (A) the portion of the exempt-interest dividends exempt from state taxation under the laws of
the United States; and
    (B) the portion of the exempt-interest dividends derived from interest income on obligations of
the state of Minnesota or its political or governmental subdivisions, municipalities, governmental
agencies or instrumentalities, but only if the portion of the exempt-interest dividends from such
Minnesota sources paid to all shareholders represents 95 percent or more of the exempt-interest
dividends, including any dividends exempt under subitem (A), that are paid by the regulated
investment company as defined in section 851(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the fund of the
regulated investment company as defined in section 851(g) of the Internal Revenue Code, making
the payment; and
    (iii) for the purposes of items (i) and (ii), interest on obligations of an Indian tribal government
described in section 7871(c) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be treated as interest income on

and use, motor vehicle sales, or excise taxes paid to any other state or to any province or territory of
Canada, to the extent allowed as a deduction under section 63(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, but
the addition may not be more than the amount by which the itemized deductions as allowed under
section 63(d) of the Internal Revenue Code exceeds the amount of the standard deduction as defined
in section 63(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, disregarding the amounts allowed under sections
63(c)(1)(C) and 63(c)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code. For the purpose of this paragraph, the
disallowance of itemized deductions under section 68 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, income,
sales and use, motor vehicle sales, or excise taxes are the last itemized deductions disallowed;
   (3) the capital gain amount of a lump-sum distribution to which the special tax under section
1122(h)(3)(B)(ii) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Public Law 99-514, applies;
    (4) the amount of income taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year under this chapter and
taxes based on net income paid to any other state or any province or territory of Canada, to the
extent allowed as a deduction in determining federal adjusted gross income. For the purpose of
this paragraph, income taxes do not include the taxes imposed by sections 290.0922, subdivision 1,
paragraph (b), 290.9727, 290.9728, and 290.9729;
   (5) the amount of expense, interest, or taxes disallowed pursuant to section 290.10 other than
expenses or interest used in computing net interest income for the subtraction allowed under
subdivision 19b, clause (1);
    (6) the amount of a partner's pro rata share of net income which does not flow through to the
partner because the partnership elected to pay the tax on the income under section 6242(a)(2) of the
Internal Revenue Code;
    (7) 80 percent of the depreciation deduction allowed under section 168(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code. For purposes of this clause, if the taxpayer has an activity that in the taxable year
generates a deduction for depreciation under section 168(k) and the activity generates a loss for the
taxable year that the taxpayer is not allowed to claim for the taxable year, "the depreciation allowed
under section 168(k)" for the taxable year is limited to excess of the depreciation claimed by the
activity under section 168(k) over the amount of the loss from the activity that is not allowed in
the taxable year. In succeeding taxable years when the losses not allowed in the taxable year are
allowed, the depreciation under section 168(k) is allowed;
   (8) 80 percent of the amount by which the deduction allowed by section 179 of the Internal
Revenue Code exceeds the deduction allowable by section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended through December 31, 2003;
    (9) to the extent deducted in computing federal taxable income, the amount of the deduction
allowable under section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code;
   (10) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2013, the exclusion allowed under section
139A of the Internal Revenue Code for federal subsidies for prescription drug plans;

     Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290.06, subdivision 2c, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2c. Schedules of rates for individuals, estates, and trusts. (a) The income taxes imposed
by this chapter upon married individuals filing joint returns and surviving spouses as defined in
section 2(a) of the Internal Revenue Code must be computed by applying to their taxable net income
the following schedule of rates:
     (1) On the first $25,680, 5.35 percent;

   (2) On all over $25,680, but not over $102,030, 7.05 percent;
   (3) On all over $102,030, 7.85 percent.
    Married individuals filing separate returns, estates, and trusts must compute their income tax by
applying the above rates to their taxable income, except that the income brackets will be one-half
of the above amounts.
   (b) The income taxes imposed by this chapter upon unmarried individuals must be computed by
applying to taxable net income the following schedule of rates:
   (1) On the first $17,570, 5.35 percent;
   (2) On all over $17,570, but not over $57,710, 7.05 percent;
   (3) On all over $57,710, 7.85 percent.
    (c) The income taxes imposed by this chapter upon unmarried individuals qualifying as a head
of household as defined in section 2(b) of the Internal Revenue Code must be computed by applying
to taxable net income the following schedule of rates:
   (1) On the first $21,630, 5.35 percent;
   (2) On all over $21,630, but not over $86,910, 7.05 percent;
   (3) On all over $86,910, 7.85 percent.
    (d) In lieu of a tax computed according to the rates set forth in this subdivision, the tax of
any individual taxpayer whose taxable net income for the taxable year is less than an amount
determined by the commissioner must be computed in accordance with tables prepared and issued
by the commissioner of revenue based on income brackets of not more than $100. The amount of
tax for each bracket shall be computed at the rates set forth in this subdivision, provided that the
commissioner may disregard a fractional part of a dollar unless it amounts to 50 cents or more, in
which case it may be increased to $1.
    (e) An individual who is not a Minnesota resident for the entire year must compute the
individual's Minnesota income tax as provided in this subdivision. After the application of the
nonrefundable credits provided in this chapter, the tax liability must then be multiplied by a fraction
in which:
    (1) the numerator is the individual's Minnesota source federal adjusted gross income as defined
in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code and increased by the additions required under section
290.01, subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (12), (13), (16), ­

and assignability provisions of section 290.081, clause (a), or 290.17; and
    (2) the denominator is the individual's federal adjusted gross income as defined in section
62 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, increased by the amounts specified in section 290.01,
subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (12), (13), (16), ­

exemption certificate as described in section 297A.72 indicating that the purchaser is authorized
to pay any sales or use tax due on purchases made by the purchaser directly to the commissioner
under section 297A.89, or a fully completed exemption certificate claiming an exemption for
direct mail. If the purchaser provides one of the exemption certificates listed, then the seller, in the
absence of bad faith, is relieved of all obligations to collect, pay, or remit the tax on any transaction
involving other direct mail to which the certificate applies. The purchaser shall source the sale to
the jurisdictions to which the other direct mail is to be delivered to the recipients of the mail, and
shall report and pay any applicable tax due.

   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 297A.68, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 42. Resold admission tickets. (a) When a ticket reseller who purchased a ticket from a
seller who is in the business of selling tickets resells the ticket, the ticket reseller must charge tax
on the total amount for which the ticket is resold and the following rules apply:
    (1) if the ticket reseller did not use a fully completed exemption certificate to claim the exemption
from tax for resale, but instead paid tax on the original purchase, then the ticket reseller may do one
of the following:
   (i) seek a refund of that tax under section 289A.50; or
    (ii) pass through to the purchaser the amount of the tax the ticket reseller paid on the original
purchase, by giving the purchaser credit for the Minnesota state and local tax paid by the ticket
reseller on the ticket reseller's original purchase of the ticket. Credit for the tax cannot exceed either
the sales tax paid on the original price of the ticket or the sales tax charged by the ticket reseller to
the final purchaser;
    (2) if the ticket reseller did not pay tax on the original purchase, tax is due on the full amount of
the ticket when resold, without a credit given to the final purchaser; or
   (3) the ticket reseller must retain records documenting the price and tax paid by the ticket reseller
when purchasing the ticket and the price and tax collected when the ticket reseller resells the ticket.
    (b) When a ticket reseller who purchased a ticket from a seller who is not in the business of
selling tickets resells the ticket, the ticket reseller must charge tax on the total amount for which the
ticket is resold and the following rules apply:
    (1) the ticket reseller may credit its purchaser an amount equal to the tax the ticket reseller would
have paid its seller, had the seller been registered to collect tax on its sale of the ticket to the ticket
reseller. Credit for the tax cannot exceed either the sales tax paid on the original price of the ticket
or the sales tax charged by the ticket reseller to the final purchaser. It is presumed that the original
purchase price of the ticket is the face amount of the ticket;
    (2) if no tax was paid on the original purchase, tax is due on the full amount of the ticket when
resold, without a credit given to the ticket reseller's purchaser; and

   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.1763, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Expenditures outside district. (a) For each tax increment financing district, an amount
equal to at least 75 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments paid by properties in the
district must be expended on activities in the district or to pay bonds, to the extent that the proceeds
of the bonds were used to finance activities in the district or to pay, or secure payment of, debt service
2564                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [59TH DAY

on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment districts for which the request for
certification was made after June 30, 1995, the in-district percentage for purposes of the preceding
sentence is 80 percent. Not more than 25 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments
paid by properties in the district may be expended, through a development fund or otherwise, on
activities outside of the district but within the defined geographic area of the project except to pay,
or secure payment of, debt service on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment
districts for which the request for certification was made after June 30, 1995, the pooling percentage
for purposes of the preceding sentence is 20 percent. The revenue derived from tax increments for
the district that are expended on costs under section 469.176, subdivision 4h, paragraph (b), may
be deducted first before calculating the percentages that must be expended within and without the
district.
    (b) In the case of a housing district, a housing project, as defined in section 469.174, subdivision
11, is an activity in the district.
    (c) All administrative expenses are for activities outside of the district, except that if the only
expenses for activities outside of the district under this subdivision are for the purposes described
in paragraph (d), administrative expenses will be considered as expenditures for activities in the
district.
    (d) The authority may elect, in the tax increment financing plan for the district, to increase by
up to ten percentage points the permitted amount of expenditures for activities located outside the
geographic area of the district under paragraph (a). As permitted by section 469.176, subdivision
4k, the expenditures, including the permitted expenditures under paragraph (a), need not be made
within the geographic area of the project. Expenditures that meet the requirements of this paragraph
are legally permitted expenditures of the district, notwithstanding section 469.176, subdivisions 4b,
4c, and 4j. To qualify for the increase under this paragraph, the expenditures must:
    (1) be used exclusively to assist housing that meets the requirement for a qualified low-income
building, as that term is used in section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code; and
    (2) not exceed the qualified basis of the housing, as defined under section 42(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code, less the amount of any credit allowed under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code;
and
   (3) be used to:
   (i) acquire and prepare the site of the housing;
   (ii) acquire, construct, or rehabilitate the housing; or
   (iii) make public improvements directly related to the housing.
                                                                 ­; or
   (4) be used to develop housing:
   (i) if the market value of the housing does not exceed the lesser of:
   (A) 150 percent of the average market of single-family homes in that municipality; or
    (B) $200,000 for municipalities located in the metropolitan area, as defined in section 473.121,
or $125,000 for all other municipalities; and

    (ii) if the expenditures are used to pay the cost of site acquisition, relocation, demolition of
existing structures, site preparation, and pollution abatement on one or more parcels, if the parcel
contains a residence containing one to four family dwelling units that has been vacant for six or
more months and is in foreclosure as defined in section 325N.10, subdivision 7, but without regard
to whether the residence is the owner's principal residence, and only after the redemption period
stated in the notice provided under section 580.06 has expired.
    (e) For a district created within a biotechnology and health sciences industry zone as defined in
section 469.330, subdivision 6, or for an existing district located within such a zone, tax increment
derived from such a district may be expended outside of the district but within the zone only
for expenditures required for the construction of public infrastructure necessary to support the
activities of the zone, land acquisition, and other redevelopment costs as defined in section 469.176,
subdivision 4j. These expenditures are considered as expenditures for activities within the district.
   (f) The authority under paragraph (d), clause (4), expires on December 31, 2016. Increments
may continue to be expended under this authority after that date, if they are used to pay bonds or
binding contracts that would qualify under subdivision 3, paragraph (a), if December 31, 2016, is
considered to be the last date of the five-year period after certification under that provision.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for any district that is subject to the provisions
of section 469.1763, regardless of when the request for certification of the district was made.
   Sec. 14. Laws 2010, chapter 389, article 7, section 22, is amended to read:
    Sec. 22. CITY OF RAMSEY; TAX INCREMENT FINANCING DISTRICT; SPECIAL
RULES.
    (a) If the city of Ramsey or an authority of the city elects upon the adoption of a tax increment
financing plan for a district, the rules under this section apply to a redevelopment tax increment

10, but including Parcels 28-32-25-43-0007 and 28-32-25-34-0002 in their entirety, and excluding
the Anoka County Regional Park property in its entirety. A parcel within this area that is included
in a tax increment financing district that was certified before the date of enactment of this act may
be included in the district created under this act if the initial district is decertified.
    (b) The requirements for qualifying a redevelopment tax increment district under Minnesota
Statutes, section 469.174, subdivision 10, do not apply to the parcels located within the district.

    Subd. 25. Class 4. (a) Class 4a is residential real estate containing four or more units and used or
held for use by the owner or by the tenants or lessees of the owner as a residence for rental periods
of 30 days or more, excluding property qualifying for class 4d. Class 4a also includes hospitals
licensed under sections 144.50 to 144.56, other than hospitals exempt under section 272.02, and
contiguous property used for hospital purposes, without regard to whether the property has been
platted or subdivided. The market value of class 4a property has a class rate of 1.25 percent.
     (b) Class 4b includes:
   (1) residential real estate containing less than four units that does not qualify as class 4bb, other
than seasonal residential recreational property;
     (2) manufactured homes not classified under any other provision;
   (3) a dwelling, garage, and surrounding one acre of property on a nonhomestead farm classified
under subdivision 23, paragraph (b) containing two or three units; and
     (4) unimproved property that is classified residential as determined under subdivision 33.
     The market value of class 4b property has a class rate of 1.25 percent.

     Class 4bb property has the same class rates as class 1a property under subdivision 22.
    Property that has been classified as seasonal residential recreational property at any time during
which it has been owned by the current owner or spouse of the current owner does not qualify for
class 4bb.
     (d) Class 4c property includes:
      (1) except as provided in subdivision 22, paragraph (c), real and personal property devoted
to commercial temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes, ­n                             i­­  l­d

clause, the owner must submit a declaration to the assessor designating the cabins or units occupied
for 250 days or less in the year preceding the year of assessment by January 15 of the assessment
year. Those cabins or units and a proportionate share of the land on which they are located must
be designated class 4c under this clause as otherwise provided. The remainder of the cabins or
units and a proportionate share of the land on which they are located will be designated as class
3a. The owner of property desiring designation as class 4c property under this clause must provide
guest registers or other records demonstrating that the units for which class 4c designation is sought
were not occupied for more than 250 days in the year preceding the assessment if so requested.
The portion of a property operated as a (1) restaurant, (2) bar, (3) gift shop, (4) conference center
or meeting room, and (5) other nonresidential facility operated on a commercial basis not directly
related to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes does not qualify

houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski equipment; providing marina
services, launch services, or guide services; or selling bait and fishing tackle;

membership fee may not be required in order to use the property for golfing, and its green fees for
golfing must be comparable to green fees typically charged by municipal courses; and
   (ii) it meets the requirements of section 273.112, subdivision 3, paragraph (d).

community service oriented organization and not used for residential purposes on either a
temporary or permanent basis, provided that:
   (i) the property is not used for a revenue-producing activity for more than six days in the calendar
year preceding the year of assessment; or
   (ii) the organization makes annual charitable contributions and donations at least equal to the
property's previous year's property taxes and the property is allowed to be used for public and
community meetings or events for no charge, as appropriate to the size of the facility.

assessments, fees, auditing costs, and utility payments;
   (B) "property taxes" excludes the state general tax;
    (C) a "nonprofit community service oriented organization" means any corporation, society,
association, foundation, or institution organized and operated exclusively for charitable, religious,

conducted by organizations licensed under chapter 349, an insurance business, or office or other
space leased or rented to a lessee who conducts a for-profit enterprise on the premises.
Any portion of the property not qualifying under either item (i) or (ii) is class 3a. The use of the
property for social events open exclusively to members and their guests for periods of less than 24
hours, when an admission is not charged nor any revenues are received by the organization shall not
be considered a revenue-producing activity.
     The organization shall maintain records of its charitable contributions and donations and of
public meetings and events held on the property and make them available upon request any time
to the assessor to ensure eligibility. An organization meeting the requirement under item (ii) must
file an application by May 1 with the assessor for eligibility for the current year's assessment. The
commissioner shall prescribe a uniform application form and instructions;

    (e) Class 4d property is qualifying low-income rental housing certified to the assessor by the
Housing Finance Agency under section 273.128, subdivision 3. If only a portion of the units in the
building qualify as low-income rental housing units as certified under section 273.128, subdivision
3, only the proportion of qualifying units to the total number of units in the building qualify for class
4d. The remaining portion of the building shall be classified by the assessor based upon its use. Class
4d also includes the same proportion of land as the qualifying low-income rental housing units are to
the total units in the building. For all properties qualifying as class 4d, the market value determined
by the assessor must be based on the normal approach to value using normal unrestricted rents.
   Class 4d property has a class rate of 0.75 percent.

to the assessor by July 1 of each assessment year, except that an annual reapplication is not required

the benefit described in paragraph (b), clause (2), and the property continues to qualify until there is
a change in ownership. For an application received after July 1 of any calendar year, the exclusion

shall become effective for the following assessment year.
    (i) A first-time application by a qualifying spouse for the market value exclusion under paragraph
(d) may be made any time within two years of the death of the service member.
   (j) For purposes of this subdivision:
   (1) "active service" has the meaning given in section 190.05;
   (2) "own" means that the person's name is present as an owner on the property deed;
    (3) "primary family caregiver" means a person who is approved by the secretary of the United
States Department of Veterans Affairs for assistance as the primary provider of personal care services
for an eligible veteran under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers,
codified as United States Code, title 38, section 1720G; and
   (4) "veteran" has the meaning given the term in section 197.447.
   (k) The purpose of this provision of law providing a level of homestead property tax relief for
gravely disabled veterans, their primary family caregivers, and their surviving spouses is to help
ease the burdens of war for those among our state's citizens who bear those burdens most heavily.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. (a) This section is effective for taxes payable in 2012 and thereafter,
and applies to homesteads that initially qualified for the exclusion for taxes payable in 2009 and
thereafter.
    (b) A qualifier under paragraph (c) that would have been eligible for a market value exclusion
under this section for taxes payable in 2011, if the change under this section had been effective for
that year, shall be eligible to receive the benefit of the exclusion for the remaining number of total
taxes payable years provided under paragraph (c).
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 274.01, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Ordinary board; meetings, deadlines, grievances. (a) The town board of a
town, or the council or other governing body of a city, is the board of appeal and equalization except
(1) in cities whose charters provide for a board of equalization or (2) in any city or town that has
transferred its local board of review power and duties to the county board as provided in subdivision
3. The county assessor shall fix a day and time when the board or the board of equalization shall meet
in the assessment districts of the county. Notwithstanding any law or city charter to the contrary, a
city board of equalization shall be referred to as a board of appeal and equalization. On or before
February 15 of each year the assessor shall give written notice of the time to the city or town clerk.
Notwithstanding the provisions of any charter to the contrary, the meetings must be held between
April 1 and May 31 each year, provided that the board may review appeals of denials of green acres
treatment as provided in paragraph (h) at any time. The clerk shall give published and posted notice
of the meeting at least ten days before the date of the meeting.
    The board shall meet at the office of the clerk to review the assessment and classification of
property in the town or city. No changes in valuation or classification which are intended to correct
errors in judgment by the county assessor may be made by the county assessor after the board
has adjourned in those cities or towns that hold a local board of review; however, corrections of
errors that are merely clerical in nature or changes that extend homestead treatment to property are
2588                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [59TH DAY

permitted after adjournment until the tax extension date for that assessment year. The changes must
be fully documented and maintained in the assessor's office and must be available for review by
any person. A copy of the changes made during this period in those cities or towns that hold a local
board of review must be sent to the county board no later than December 31 of the assessment year.
    (b) The board shall determine whether the taxable property in the town or city has been properly
placed on the list and properly valued by the assessor. If real or personal property has been omitted,
the board shall place it on the list with its market value, and correct the assessment so that each
tract or lot of real property, and each article, parcel, or class of personal property, is entered on the
assessment list at its market value. No assessment of the property of any person may be raised unless
the person has been duly notified of the intent of the board to do so. On application of any person
feeling aggrieved, the board shall review the assessment or classification, or both, and correct it as
appears just. The board may not make an individual market value adjustment or classification change
that would benefit the property if the owner or other person having control over the property has
refused the assessor access to inspect the property and the interior of any buildings or structures as
provided in section 273.20. A board member shall not participate in any actions of the board which
result in market value adjustments or classification changes to property owned by the board member,
the spouse, parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, uncle, aunt,
nephew, or niece of a board member, or property in which a board member has a financial interest.
The relationship may be by blood or marriage.
     (c) A local board may reduce assessments upon petition of the taxpayer but the total reductions
must not reduce the aggregate assessment made by the county assessor by more than one percent.
If the total reductions would lower the aggregate assessments made by the county assessor by more
than one percent, none of the adjustments may be made. The assessor shall correct any clerical errors
or double assessments discovered by the board without regard to the one percent limitation.
   (d) A local board does not have authority to grant an exemption or to order property removed
from the tax rolls.
    (e) A majority of the members may act at the meeting, and adjourn from day to day until they
finish hearing the cases presented. The assessor shall attend, with the assessment books and papers,
and take part in the proceedings, but must not vote. The county assessor, or an assistant delegated
by the county assessor shall attend the meetings. The board shall list separately, on a form appended
to the assessment book, all omitted property added to the list by the board and all items of property
increased or decreased, with the market value of each item of property, added or changed by the
board, placed opposite the item. The county assessor shall enter all changes made by the board in
the assessment book.
    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 3, if a person fails to appear in person, by counsel, or by
written communication before the board after being duly notified of the board's intent to raise the
assessment of the property, or if a person feeling aggrieved by an assessment or classification fails to
apply for a review of the assessment or classification, the person may not appear before the county
board of appeal and equalization for a review of the assessment or classification. This paragraph
does not apply if an assessment was made after the local board meeting, as provided in section
273.01, or if the person can establish not having received notice of market value at least five days
before the local board meeting.
   (g) The local board must complete its work and adjourn within 20 days from the time of
59TH DAY]                              WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                                 2589

convening stated in the notice of the clerk, unless a longer period is approved by the commissioner
of revenue. No action taken after that date is valid. All complaints about an assessment or
classification made after the meeting of the board must be heard and determined by the county
board of equalization. A nonresident may, at any time, before the meeting of the board file written
objections to an assessment or classification with the county assessor. The objections must be
presented to the board at its meeting by the county assessor for its consideration.
    (h) The local board may, but is not required to, review appeals from property owners of denials
by assessors of applications for valuation under section 273.111. If it intends to exercise the authority
provided in this paragraph, the board must pass a resolution stating that it will do so, and must then
review all such appeals until it passes a subsequent resolution stating that it will not review such
appeals.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for appeals denied after June 30, 2011.

to the commissioner at the time the rates for a year must be certified, and for the following reasons:
    (1) an erroneous report of taxable value by a local official;
    (2) an erroneous calculation by the commissioner; and
    (3) an increase or decrease in taxable value for commercial-industrial or seasonal residential
recreational property reported on the abstracts of tax lists submitted under section 275.29 that was

   (ii) certificates of indebtedness issued under sections 298.28 and 298.282;
   (iii) certificates of indebtedness used to fund current expenses or to pay the costs of extraordinary

    (iv) certificates of indebtedness used to fund an insufficiency in tax receipts or an insufficiency
in other revenue sources, provided that nothing in this subdivision limits the special levy authorized
under section 475.755;
   (3) to provide for the bonded indebtedness portion of payments made to another political
subdivision of the state of Minnesota;
   (4) to fund payments made to the Minnesota State Armory Building Commission under section
193.145, subdivision 2, to retire the principal and interest on armory construction bonds;
   (5) property taxes approved by voters which are levied against the referendum market value as

    (6) to fund matching requirements needed to qualify for federal or state grants or programs to

    (7) to pay the expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred in preparing for or repairing the
effects of natural disaster including the occurrence or threat of widespread or severe damage, injury,
or loss of life or property resulting from natural causes, in accordance with standards formulated
by the Emergency Services Division of the state Department of Public Safety, as allowed by the
commissioner of revenue under section 275.74, subdivision 2;
    (8) pay amounts required to correct an error in the levy certified to the county auditor by a city
or county in a levy year, but only to the extent that when added to the preceding year's levy it is not
in excess of an applicable statutory, special law or charter limitation, or the limitation imposed on
the governmental subdivision by sections 275.70 to 275.74 in the preceding levy year;
   (9) to pay an abatement under section 469.1815;

641.262, or of a correctional facility as defined in section 241.021, subdivision 1, paragraph (f), to
the extent that the county can demonstrate to the commissioner of revenue that the amount has been
included in the county budget as a direct result of a rule, minimum requirement, minimum standard,
or directive of the Department of Corrections, or to pay the operating or maintenance costs of a
regional jail as authorized in section 641.262. For purposes of this clause, a district court order is
not a rule, minimum requirement, minimum standard, or directive of the Department of Corrections.
If the county utilizes this special levy, except to pay operating or maintenance costs of a new regional
jail facility under sections 641.262 to 641.264 which will not replace an existing jail facility, any
amount levied by the county in the previous levy year for the purposes specified under this clause
and included in the county's previous year's levy limitation computed under section 275.71, shall
be deducted from the levy limit base under section 275.71, subdivision 2, when determining the
county's current year levy limitation. The county shall provide the necessary information to the

commissioner of revenue for making this determination;
     (12) to pay for operation of a lake improvement district, as authorized under section 103B.555.
If the county utilizes this special levy, any amount levied by the county in the previous levy year for
the purposes specified under this clause and included in the county's previous year's levy limitation
computed under section 275.71 shall be deducted from the levy limit base under section 275.71,
subdivision 2, when determining the county's current year levy limitation. The county shall provide
the necessary information to the commissioner of revenue for making this determination;
    (13) to repay a state or federal loan used to fund the direct or indirect required spending by
the local government due to a state or federal transportation project or other state or federal capital

    (14) to pay for court administration costs as required under section 273.1398, subdivision 4b,
less the (i) county's share of transferred fines and fees collected by the district courts in the county
for calendar year 2001 and (ii) the aid amount certified to be paid to the county in 2004 under section
273.1398, subdivision 4c; however, for taxes levied to pay for these costs in the year in which the
court financing is transferred to the state, the amount under this clause is limited to the amount of
aid the county is certified to receive under section 273.1398, subdivision 4a;
    (15) to fund a police or firefighters relief association as required under section 69.77 to the extent
that the required amount exceeds the amount levied for this purpose in 2001;
   (16) for purposes of a storm sewer improvement district under section 444.20;
    (17) to pay for the maintenance and support of a city or county society for the prevention of
cruelty to animals under section 343.11, but not to exceed in any year $4,800 or the sum of $1 per
capita based on the county's or city's population as of the most recent federal census, whichever
is greater. If the city or county uses this special levy, any amount levied by the city or county in
the previous levy year for the purposes specified in this clause and included in the city's or county's
previous year's levy limit computed under section 275.71, must be deducted from the levy limit base
under section 275.71, subdivision 2, in determining the city's or county's current year levy limit;
    (18) for counties, to pay for the increase in their share of health and human service costs caused
by reductions in federal health and human services grants effective after September 30, 2007;
    (19) for a city, for the costs reasonably and necessarily incurred for securing, maintaining, or
demolishing foreclosed or abandoned residential properties, as allowed by the commissioner of
revenue under section 275.74, subdivision 2. A city must have either (i) a foreclosure rate of at least
1.4 percent in 2007, or (ii) a foreclosure rate in 2007 in the city or in a zip code area of the city that
is at least 50 percent higher than the average foreclosure rate in the metropolitan area, as defined in
section 473.121, subdivision 2, to use this special levy. For purposes of this paragraph, "foreclosure
rate" means the number of foreclosures, as indicated by sheriff sales records, divided by the number
of households in the city in 2007;
    (20) for a city, for the unreimbursed costs of redeployed traffic-control agents and lost traffic
citation revenue due to the collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge, as certified to the Federal Highway
Administration;
   (21) to pay costs attributable to wages and benefits for sheriff, police, and fire personnel. If a local
governmental unit did not use this special levy in the previous year its levy limit base under section
59TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                         2593

275.71 shall be reduced by the amount equal to the amount it levied for the purposes specified in
this clause in the previous year;
    (22) an amount equal to any reductions in the certified aids or credit reimbursements payable
under sections 477A.011 to 477A.014, and section 273.1384, due to unallotment under section
16A.152 or reductions under another provision of law. The amount of the levy allowed under
this clause for each year is limited to the amount unallotted or reduced from the aids and credit
reimbursements certified for payment in the year following the calendar year in which the tax
levy is certified unless the unallotment or reduction amount is not known by September 1 of the
levy certification year, and the local government has not adjusted its levy under section 275.065,
subdivision 6, or 275.07, subdivision 6, in which case that unallotment or reduction amount may
be levied in the following year;
    (23) to pay for the difference between one-half of the costs of confining sex offenders undergoing
the civil commitment process and any state payments for this purpose pursuant to section 253B.185,
subdivision 5;
    (24) for a county to pay the costs of the first year of maintaining and operating a new facility or
new expansion, either of which contains courts, corrections, dispatch, criminal investigation labs,
or other public safety facilities and for which all or a portion of the funding for the site acquisition,
building design, site preparation, construction, and related equipment was issued or authorized prior
to the imposition of levy limits in 2008. The levy limit base shall then be increased by an amount
equal to the new facility's first full year's operating costs as described in this clause; ­
                                                                                           a­

    (25) for the estimated amount of reduction to market value credit reimbursements under section
273.1384 for credits payable in the year in which the levy is payable.
                                                                     ­, except for a reduction due to
the repeal of section 273.1384, subdivision 1; and
    (26) for the reduction in the county share of payments to the county under sections 97A.061 and
477A.11 to 477A.17 between payments certified in calendar year 2011 and the estimated amount
of the county share in the year in which the levy is payable provided the reduction is at least one
percent of the county's total payable 2011 certified levy.

      Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 88.49, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Cancellation. Upon the failure of the owner faithfully to fulfill and perform such
contract or any provision thereof, or any requirement of sections 88.47 to 88.53, or any rule adopted
by the commissioner thereunder, the commissioner may cancel the contract in the manner herein
provided. The commissioner shall give to the owner, in the manner prescribed in section 88.48,

the contract should be canceled and make an order to that effect. Notice of the commissioner's
determination and the making of the order shall be given to the owner in the manner provided in

subdivision 1, together with interest on such taxes and assessments at six percent per annum, but
without penalties.
   The commissioner may in like manner and with like effect cancel the contract upon written
application of the owner.

    For purposes of this chapter, lottery prizes, as set forth in section 349A.08, subdivision 8, and
amounts granted to persons by the legislature on the recommendation of the joint senate-house of
representatives Subcommittee on Claims shall be treated as refunds.
    In the case of a joint property tax refund payable to spouses under chapter 290A, the refund
shall be considered as belonging to each spouse in the proportion of the total refund that equals
each spouse's proportion of the total income determined under section 290A.03, subdivision 3.
In the case of a joint income tax refund under chapter 289A, the refund shall be considered as
belonging to each spouse in the proportion of the total refund that equals each spouse's proportion
of the total taxable income determined under section 290.01, subdivision 29. The commissioner

shall remit the entire refund to the claimant agency, which shall, upon the request of the spouse
who does not owe the debt, determine the amount of the refund belonging to that spouse and refund
the amount to that spouse. For court fines, fees, and surcharges and court-ordered restitution under
section 611A.04, subdivision 2, the notice provided by the commissioner of revenue under section
270A.07, subdivision 2, paragraph (b), serves as the appropriate legal notice to the spouse who does
not owe the debt.

subdivision 23, paragraph (a), at least a portion of which is enrolled under section 273.111, is
entitled to valuation and tax deferment under this section if:
  (1) the property is contiguous to class 2a property enrolled under section 273.111 under the same
ownership;
   (2) there are no delinquent property taxes on the land; and
   (3) the property is not also enrolled for valuation and deferment under section 273.111 or

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.13, subdivision 23, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23. Class 2. (a) An agricultural homestead consists of class 2a agricultural land that is
homesteaded, along with any class 2b rural vacant land that is contiguous to the class 2a land under
the same ownership. The market value of the house and garage and immediately surrounding one
acre of land has the same class rates as class 1a or 1b property under subdivision 22. The value of the
remaining land including improvements up to the first tier valuation limit of agricultural homestead
property has a net class rate of 0.5 percent of market value. The remaining property over the first
tier has a class rate of one percent of market value. For purposes of this subdivision, the "first tier
valuation limit of agricultural homestead property" and "first tier" means the limit certified under
section 273.11, subdivision 23.
    (b) Class 2a agricultural land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
agricultural land and buildings. Class 2a property has a net class rate of one percent of market
value, unless it is part of an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a). Class 2a property must
also include any property that would otherwise be classified as 2b, but is interspersed with class
2a property, including but not limited to sloughs, wooded wind shelters, acreage abutting ditches,
ravines, rock piles, land subject to a setback requirement, and other similar land that is impractical
for the assessor to value separately from the rest of the property or that is unlikely to be able to
be sold separately from the rest of the property.
    An assessor may classify the part of a parcel described in this subdivision that is used for
agricultural purposes as class 2a and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use.

    (c) Class 2b rural vacant land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
unplatted real estate, rural in character and not used for agricultural purposes, including land
used for growing trees for timber, lumber, and wood and wood products, that is not improved
with a structure. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
Any parcel of 20 acres or more improved with a structure that is not a minor, ancillary nonresidential
structure must be split-classified, and ten acres must be assigned to the split parcel containing the
structure. Class 2b property has a net class rate of one percent of market value unless it is part of
an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a), or qualifies as class 2c under paragraph (d).
     (d) Class 2c managed forest land consists of no less than 20 and no more than 1,920 acres
statewide per taxpayer that is being managed under a forest management plan ­h                          t­­

                     am­ . It has a class rate of .65 percent, provided that the owner of the property must
apply to the assessor in order for the property to initially qualify for the reduced rate and provide
the information required by the assessor to verify that the property qualifies for the reduced rate.
If the assessor receives the application and information before May 1 in an assessment year, the
property qualifies beginning with that assessment year. If the assessor receives the application
and information after April 30 in an assessment year, the property may not qualify until the next
assessment year. The commissioner of natural resources must concur that the land is qualified. The
commissioner of natural resources shall annually provide county assessors verification information
on a timely basis. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
For purposes of this paragraph, a "forest management plan" means a written document providing
a framework for site-specific healthy, productive, and sustainable forest resources. A forest
management plan must include at least the following: (i) forest management goals for the land;
(ii) a reliable field inventory of the individual forest cover types, their age, and density; (iii) a
description of the soil type and quality; (iv) an aerial photo and/or map of the vegetation and other
natural features of the land clearly indicating the boundaries of the land and of the forest land; (v)
the proposed future conditions of the land; (vi) prescriptions to meet proposed future conditions
of the land; (vii) a recommended timetable for implementing the prescribed activities; and (viii)
a legal description of the land encompassing the parcels included in the plan. All management
activities prescribed in a plan must be in accordance with the recommended timber harvesting and
forest management guidelines. The commissioner of natural resources shall provide a framework
for plan content and updating and revising plans.
    (e) Agricultural land as used in this section means contiguous acreage of ten acres or more, used
during the preceding year for agricultural purposes. "Agricultural purposes" as used in this section
means the raising, cultivation, drying, or storage of agricultural products for sale, or the storage
of machinery or equipment used in support of agricultural production by the same farm entity.
For a property to be classified as agricultural based only on the drying or storage of agricultural
products, the products being dried or stored must have been produced by the same farm entity as the
entity operating the drying or storage facility. "Agricultural purposes" also includes enrollment in
the Reinvest in Minnesota program under sections 103F.501 to 103F.535 or the federal Conservation
Reserve Program as contained in Public Law 99-198 or a similar state or federal conservation
program if the property was classified as agricultural (i) under this subdivision for the assessment
year 2002 or (ii) in the year prior to its enrollment. Agricultural classification shall not be based
upon the market value of any residential structures on the parcel or contiguous parcels under the
2600                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [59TH DAY

same ownership.
    (f) Real estate of less than ten acres, which is exclusively or intensively used for raising or
cultivating agricultural products, shall be considered as agricultural land. To qualify under this
paragraph, property that includes a residential structure must be used intensively for one of the
following purposes:
    (i) for drying or storage of grain or storage of machinery or equipment used to support
agricultural activities on other parcels of property operated by the same farming entity;
    (ii) as a nursery, provided that only those acres used to produce nursery stock are considered
agricultural land;
   (iii) for livestock or poultry confinement, provided that land that is used only for pasturing and
grazing does not qualify; or
    (iv) for market farming; for purposes of this paragraph, "market farming" means the cultivation
of one or more fruits or vegetables or production of animal or other agricultural products for sale to
local markets by the farmer or an organization with which the farmer is affiliated.
   (g) Land shall be classified as agricultural even if all or a portion of the agricultural use of that
property is the leasing to, or use by another person for agricultural purposes.
   Classification under this subdivision is not determinative for qualifying under section 273.111.
    (h) The property classification under this section supersedes, for property tax purposes only, any
locally administered agricultural policies or land use restrictions that define minimum or maximum
farm acreage.
   (i) The term "agricultural products" as used in this subdivision includes production for sale of:
   (1) livestock, dairy animals, dairy products, poultry and poultry products, fur-bearing animals,
horticultural and nursery stock, fruit of all kinds, vegetables, forage, grains, bees, and apiary
products by the owner;
   (2) fish bred for sale and consumption if the fish breeding occurs on land zoned for agricultural
use;
    (3) the commercial boarding of horses, which may include related horse training and riding
instruction, if the boarding is done on property that is also used for raising pasture to graze horses
or raising or cultivating other agricultural products as defined in clause (1);
    (4) property which is owned and operated by nonprofit organizations used for equestrian
activities, excluding racing;
    (5) game birds and waterfowl bred and raised for use on a shooting preserve licensed under
section 97A.115;
   (6) insects primarily bred to be used as food for animals;
   (7) trees, grown for sale as a crop, including short rotation woody crops, and not sold for timber,
lumber, wood, or wood products; and

   (8) maple syrup taken from trees grown by a person licensed by the Minnesota Department of
Agriculture under chapter 28A as a food processor.
    (j) If a parcel used for agricultural purposes is also used for commercial or industrial purposes,
including but not limited to:
   (1) wholesale and retail sales;
   (2) processing of raw agricultural products or other goods;
   (3) warehousing or storage of processed goods; and
   (4) office facilities for the support of the activities enumerated in clauses (1), (2), and (3),
the assessor shall classify the part of the parcel used for agricultural purposes as class 1b, 2a, or 2b,
whichever is appropriate, and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use. The grading, sorting,
and packaging of raw agricultural products for first sale is considered an agricultural purpose. A
greenhouse or other building where horticultural or nursery products are grown that is also used for
the conduct of retail sales must be classified as agricultural if it is primarily used for the growing
of horticultural or nursery products from seed, cuttings, or roots and occasionally as a showroom
for the retail sale of those products. Use of a greenhouse or building only for the display of already
grown horticultural or nursery products does not qualify as an agricultural purpose.
    (k) The assessor shall determine and list separately on the records the market value of the
homestead dwelling and the one acre of land on which that dwelling is located. If any farm
buildings or structures are located on this homesteaded acre of land, their market value shall not be
included in this separate determination.
    (l) Class 2d airport landing area consists of a landing area or public access area of a privately
owned public use airport. It has a class rate of one percent of market value. To qualify for
classification under this paragraph, a privately owned public use airport must be licensed as a
public airport under section 360.018. For purposes of this paragraph, "landing area" means that part
of a privately owned public use airport properly cleared, regularly maintained, and made available
to the public for use by aircraft and includes runways, taxiways, aprons, and sites upon which are
situated landing or navigational aids. A landing area also includes land underlying both the primary
surface and the approach surfaces that comply with all of the following:
    (i) the land is properly cleared and regularly maintained for the primary purposes of the landing,
taking off, and taxiing of aircraft; but that portion of the land that contains facilities for servicing,
repair, or maintenance of aircraft is not included as a landing area;
   (ii) the land is part of the airport property; and
   (iii) the land is not used for commercial or residential purposes.
The land contained in a landing area under this paragraph must be described and certified by the
commissioner of transportation. The certification is effective until it is modified, or until the airport
or landing area no longer meets the requirements of this paragraph. For purposes of this paragraph,
"public access area" means property used as an aircraft parking ramp, apron, or storage hangar, or
an arrival and departure building in connection with the airport.
   (m) Class 2e consists of land with a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively being
2602                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [59TH DAY

mined and is not otherwise classified as class 2a or 2b, provided that the land is not located in a county
that has elected to opt-out of the aggregate preservation program as provided in section 273.1115,
subdivision 6. It has a class rate of one percent of market value. To qualify for classification under
this paragraph, the property must be at least ten contiguous acres in size and the owner of the property
must record with the county recorder of the county in which the property is located an affidavit
containing:
   (1) a legal description of the property;
   (2) a disclosure that the property contains a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively
being mined but is present on the entire parcel enrolled;
   (3) documentation that the conditional use under the county or local zoning ordinance of this
property is for mining; and
    (4) documentation that a permit has been issued by the local unit of government or the mining
activity is allowed under local ordinance. The disclosure must include a statement from a registered
professional geologist, engineer, or soil scientist delineating the deposit and certifying that it is a
commercial aggregate deposit.
   For purposes of this section and section 273.1115, "commercial aggregate deposit" means a
deposit that will yield crushed stone or sand and gravel that is suitable for use as a construction
aggregate; and "actively mined" means the removal of top soil and overburden in preparation for
excavation or excavation of a commercial deposit.
    (n) When any portion of the property under this subdivision or subdivision 22 begins to be
actively mined, the owner must file a supplemental affidavit within 60 days from the day any
aggregate is removed stating the number of acres of the property that is actively being mined.
The acres actively being mined must be (1) valued and classified under subdivision 24 in the next
subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource preservation property
tax program under section 273.1115, if the land was enrolled in that program. Copies of the
original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed with the county assessor, the local
zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Land and Minerals.
A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent portion of the property is actively
mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres, even if the actual mining activity
constitutes less than five acres.
   (o) The definitions prescribed by the commissioner under paragraphs (c) and (d) are not rules
and are exempt from the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14, and the provisions in section 14.386
concerning exempt rules do not apply.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2011, payable in 2012, and
thereafter.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.13, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 35. Homestead market value exclusion. (a) Prior to determining a property's net tax
capacity under this section, property classified as class 1a or 1b under subdivision 22, and the
portion of property classified as class 2a under subdivision 23 consisting of the house, garage, and
surrounding one acre of land, shall be eligible for a market value exclusion as determined under
paragraph (b).

    (b) For a homestead valued at $76,000 or less, the exclusion is 40 percent of market value. For
a homestead valued between $76,000 and $413,800, the exclusion is $30,400 minus nine percent
of the valuation over $76,000. For a homestead valued at $413,800 or more, there is no valuation
exclusion. The valuation exclusion shall be rounded to the nearest whole dollar, and may not be less
than zero.
    (c) Any valuation exclusions or adjustments under section 273.11 shall be applied prior to
determining the amount of the valuation exclusion under this subdivision.
    (d) In the case of a property that is classified as part homestead and part nonhomestead, (i)
the exclusion shall apply only to the homestead portion of the property, but (ii) if a portion of
a property is classified as nonhomestead solely because not all the owners occupy the property,
not all the owners have qualifying relatives occupying the property, or solely because not all the
spouses of owners occupy the property, the exclusion amount shall be initially computed as if that
nonhomestead portion were also in the homestead class and then prorated to the owner-occupant's
percentage of ownership. For the purpose of this section, when an owner-occupant's spouse does
not occupy the property, the percentage of ownership for the owner-occupant spouse is one-half of
the couple's ownership percentage.

       Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 276.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Contents of tax statements. (a) The treasurer shall provide for the printing of the tax
statements. The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the property tax statement
and its contents. The tax statement must not state or imply that property tax credits are paid by the
state of Minnesota. The statement must contain a tabulated statement of the dollar amount due to

each taxing authority and the amount of the state tax from the parcel of real property for which a
particular tax statement is prepared. The dollar amounts attributable to the county, the state tax, the
voter approved school tax, the other local school tax, the township or municipality, and the total
of the metropolitan special taxing districts as defined in section 275.065, subdivision 3, paragraph
(i), must be separately stated. The amounts due all other special taxing districts, if any, may be
aggregated except that any levies made by the regional rail authorities in the county of Anoka,
Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, or Washington under chapter 398A shall be listed on a
separate line directly under the appropriate county's levy. If the county levy under this paragraph
includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581,
the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately stated from the remaining county levy
amount. In the case of Ramsey County, if the county levy under this paragraph includes an amount
for public library service under section 134.07, the amount attributable for that purpose may be
separated from the remaining county levy amount. The amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying
under the senior citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount
of property tax before subtraction of the deferred property tax amount. The amount of the tax on
contamination value imposed under sections 270.91 to 270.98, if any, must also be separately stated.
The dollar amounts, including the dollar amount of any special assessments, may be rounded to the
nearest even whole dollar. For purposes of this section whole odd-numbered dollars may be adjusted
to the next higher even-numbered dollar. The amount of market value excluded under section 273.11,
subdivision 16, if any, must also be listed on the tax statement.
   (b) The property tax statements for manufactured homes and sectional structures taxed as
personal property shall contain the same information that is required on the tax statements for real
property.
   (c) Real and personal property tax statements must contain the following information in the order
given in this paragraph. The information must contain the current year tax information in the right
column with the corresponding information for the previous year in a column on the left:
   (1) the property's estimated market value under section 273.11, subdivision 1;

    Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.50, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. General right to refund. (a) Subject to the requirements of this section and
section 289A.40, a taxpayer who has paid a tax in excess of the taxes lawfully due and who files a
written claim for refund will be refunded or credited the overpayment of the tax determined by the
commissioner to be erroneously paid.
    (b) The claim must specify the name of the taxpayer, the date when and the period for which the
tax was paid, the kind of tax paid, the amount of the tax that the taxpayer claims was erroneously
paid, the grounds on which a refund is claimed, and other information relative to the payment and in
the form required by the commissioner. An income tax, estate tax, or corporate franchise tax return,
or amended return claiming an overpayment constitutes a claim for refund.
    (c) When, in the course of an examination, and within the time for requesting a refund, the
commissioner determines that there has been an overpayment of tax, the commissioner shall
refund or credit the overpayment to the taxpayer and no demand is necessary. If the overpayment
exceeds $1, the amount of the overpayment must be refunded to the taxpayer. If the amount of the
overpayment is less than $1, the commissioner is not required to refund. In these situations, the
commissioner does not have to make written findings or serve notice by mail to the taxpayer.
    (d) If the amount allowable as a credit for withholding, estimated taxes, or dependent care
exceeds the tax against which the credit is allowable, the amount of the excess is considered
an overpayment. T   ­h

              t­ The requirements of section 270C.33 do not apply to the refunding of such an
overpayment shown on the original return filed by a taxpayer.
   (e) If the entertainment tax withheld at the source exceeds by $1 or more the taxes, penalties,
and interest reported in the return of the entertainment entity or imposed by section 290.9201, the

need not refund that amount.
    (f) If the surety deposit required for a construction contract exceeds the liability of the
out-of-state contractor, the commissioner shall refund the difference to the contractor.
   (g) An action of the commissioner in refunding the amount of the overpayment does not
constitute a determination of the correctness of the return of the taxpayer.
   (h) There is appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of revenue the amount
necessary to pay refunds allowed under this section.

percent of the gross rent actually paid in cash, or its equivalent, or the portion of rent paid in lieu
of property taxes, in any calendar year by a claimant for the right of occupancy of the claimant's
Minnesota homestead in the calendar year, and which rent constitutes the basis, in the succeeding
calendar year of a claim for relief under this chapter by the claimant.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for claims based on rent paid in 2010 and
thereafter.
    Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290A.03, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
     Subd. 13. Property taxes payable. "Property taxes payable" means the property tax exclusive
of special assessments, penalties, and interest payable on a claimant's homestead after deductions
made under sections 273.135, 273.1384, 273.1391, 273.42, subdivision 2, and any other state paid
property tax credits in any calendar year, and after any refund claimed and allowable under section
290A.04, subdivision 2h, that is first payable in the year that the property tax is payable. In the case of
a claimant who makes ground lease payments, "property taxes payable" includes the amount of the
payments directly attributable to the property taxes assessed against the parcel on which the house
is located. No apportionment or reduction of the "property taxes payable" shall be required for the
use of a portion of the claimant's homestead for a business purpose if the claimant does not deduct
any business depreciation expenses for the use of a portion of the homestead in the determination of
federal adjusted gross income. For homesteads which are manufactured homes as defined in section
273.125, subdivision 8, and for homesteads which are park trailers taxed as manufactured homes
under section 168.012, subdivision 9, "property taxes payable" shall also include ­        1­9 15 percent
of the gross rent paid in the preceding year for the site on which the homestead is located. When a
homestead is owned by two or more persons as joint tenants or tenants in common, such tenants shall
determine between them which tenant may claim the property taxes payable on the homestead. If
they are unable to agree, the matter shall be referred to the commissioner of revenue whose decision
shall be final. Property taxes are considered payable in the year prescribed by law for payment of
the taxes.
    In the case of a claim relating to "property taxes payable," the claimant must have owned and
occupied the homestead on January 2 of the year in which the tax is payable and (i) the property must
have been classified as homestead property pursuant to section 273.124, on or before December 15
of the assessment year to which the "property taxes payable" relate; or (ii) the claimant must provide
documentation from the local assessor that application for homestead classification has been made
on or before December 15 of the year in which the "property taxes payable" were payable and that
the assessor has approved the application.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for claims based on rent paid in 2010 and
following years.

   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290A.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Homeowners. A claimant whose property taxes payable are in excess of the percentage
of the household income stated below shall pay an amount equal to the percent of income shown
for the appropriate household income level along with the percent to be paid by the claimant of the
remaining amount of property taxes payable. The state refund equals the amount of property taxes
payable that remain, up to the state refund amount shown below.

2014 and thereafter, the total aid in the previous year for any city means the amount of aid it was
certified to receive under this section in the previous payable year.
    (c) For aids payable in 2010 and thereafter, the total aid for any city shall not exceed the sum of
(1) ten percent of the city's net levy for the year prior to the aid distribution plus (2) its total aid in
the previous year. For aids payable in 2009 and thereafter, the total aid for any city with a population
of 2,500 or more may not be less than its total aid under this section in the previous year minus the
lesser of $10 multiplied by its population, or ten percent of its net levy in the year prior to the aid
distribution.
    (d) For aids payable in 2010 and thereafter, the total aid for a city with a population less than
2,500 must not be less than the amount it was certified to receive in the previous year minus the
lesser of $10 multiplied by its population, or five percent of its 2003 certified aid amount. For aids
payable in 2009 only, the total aid for a city with a population less than 2,500 must not be less than
what it received under this section in the previous year unless its total aid in calendar year 2008 was
aid under section 477A.011, subdivision 36, paragraph (s), in which case its minimum aid is zero.
    (e) A city's aid loss under this section may not exceed $300,000 in any year in which the total city
aid appropriation under section 477A.03, subdivision 2a, is equal or greater than the appropriation
under that subdivision in the previous year, unless the city has an adjustment in its city net tax
capacity under the process described in section 469.174, subdivision 28.
    (f) If a city's net tax capacity used in calculating aid under this section has decreased in any year

by more than 25 percent from its net tax capacity in the previous year due to property becoming
tax-exempt Indian land, the city's maximum allowed aid increase under paragraph (c) shall be
increased by an amount equal to (1) the city's tax rate in the year of the aid calculation, multiplied
by (2) the amount of its net tax capacity decrease resulting from the property becoming tax exempt.
   (g) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) to (f), the total aid for a first class city is its formula aid under
subdivision 8.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for aids payable in calendar year 2013 and
thereafter.
   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 477A.013, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 11. Aid payments in 2011 and 2012. (a) For purposes of this subdivision, "base aid"
means the lesser of (1) the total amount of aid it received under this section in 2010, after the
reductions under sections 477A.0133 and 477A.0134 and reduced by the amount of payments under
section 477A.011, subdivision 36, paragraphs (y) and (z), or (2) the amount it was certified to receive
in 2011 under subdivision 9. In 2011 only, a city that qualifies for the aid base adjustment under
section 477A.011, subdivision 36, paragraph (aa), shall receive the amount that it was certified to
receive in 2011. In 2012, a city that qualifies for the aid base adjustment under section 477A.011,
subdivision 36, paragraph (aa), shall receive the amount that it was certified to receive in 2011,
minus the aid base adjustment provided under section 477A.011, subdivision 36, paragraph (aa).
   (b) Notwithstanding aids calculated or certified for aids payable in 2011 under subdivision 9, in
2011 each city shall receive an aid distribution under this section as follows:
   (1) for a first class city, 75 percent of its base aid as defined in paragraph (a); and
   (2) for any other city, its base aid as determined under paragraph (a).
   (c) Notwithstanding aids calculated or certified for aids payable in 2012 under subdivision 9, in
2012 each city shall receive an aid distribution under this section as follows:
   (1) for a first class city, 50 percent of its base aid as defined in paragraph (a); and
   (2) for any other city, its base aid as defined under paragraph (a).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for aids payable in calendar years 2011 and 2012.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 477A.03, is amended to read:
   477A.03 APPROPRIATION.
   Subd. 2. Annual appropriation. A sum sufficient to discharge the duties imposed by sections
477A.011 to 477A.014 is annually appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of
revenue.

  Sec. 38. REPORT ON PAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXES FOR STATE NATURAL
RESOURCE LANDS.
    By December 1, 2011, the commissioner of natural resources, after consultation with the
commissioners of revenue and management and budget, and stakeholders, including representatives

ranking minority caucus members of the senate and house of representatives natural resources
and tax policy and finance committees with recommended changes to payment in lieu of taxes
for natural resource lands under Minnesota Statutes, sections 97A.061 and 477A.11 to 477A.145.
The report shall include an analysis of the current payment and distribution system, and any
recommended changes to:
   (1) the purpose of the payment system and the criteria for payments;
   (2) the rate of payments for specific classes of natural resource lands;
   (3) the formula for distribution of the payments to local units of government; and
   (4) recognition in the amount of the payments of the tax capacity foregone by the local
government due to the loss of the future development potential of the land.
   Sec. 39. COOPERATION AND CONSOLIDATION GRANTS.
   Subdivision 1. Definition. For the purposes of this section, "local government" means a town,
county, or home rule charter or statutory city.
    Subd. 2. Grants. The commissioner of administration may make a cooperation and
consolidation grant to a local government that is participating with at least one other local
government in planning for or implementing provision of services cooperatively or in planning
and implementing consolidation of services, functions, or governance. The grants shall be made
on a first-come first-served basis. The commissioner shall determine the form and content of the
application and grant agreements. At a minimum, an application must contain a resolution adopted
by the governing body of each participating local government supporting the cooperation or
consolidation effort that identifies the services and functions the local government is considering
providing cooperatively with one or more other local governments or that identifies the functions
the local governments seek to consolidate. The maximum grant amount is $100,000 per local
government.
    Subd. 3. Report. The commissioner of administration must report to the governor and legislative
committees with jurisdiction over local government governance and local government taxes and
finance on the cooperation and consolidation grants made and how the money was used, what
services and functions have been provided by local governments in cooperation with each other,
what programs or governance structures have been proposed for consolidation or consolidated,
and what impediments remain that prevent cooperation, consolidation, and service innovation. An
interim report is due February 1, 2012, and a final report is due December 15, 2012.
    Subd. 4. Appropriation. $1,000,000 in fiscal year 2012, and $2,500,000 in fiscal year 2013, are
appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of administration to make grants to counties
as provided in this section.
   Sec. 40. SUSTAINABLE FOREST INCENTIVE ACT REPEAL; TRANSITION

PAYMENTS; APPROPRIATION.
    (a) Given the limits on state budgetary resources for the coming and future fiscal biennia, the
projected cost of the sustainable forest resource management incentive program under Minnesota
Statutes, chapter 290C, of over $31,000,000 for the fiscal 2012 and 2013 biennium, and the minimal
amount of tangible public benefits of that program, the legislature determines that it is prudent and
necessary to repeal that program effective immediately to help balance the state budget for the fiscal
2012 and 2013 biennium and to help provide permanent structural balance to the state budget. The
legislature takes notice of and finds that many of the eligibility requirements for participants in
the sustainable forest incentive program are in the participants' own financial interests, determined
without regard to whether they receive state payments for doing so, and that the participants with
the largest amounts of acreage in the program do follow and would likely continue to follow similar
or more stringent management practices, regardless of whether the program exists. The legislature
further finds that the modification of the sustainable forest incentive program made by Laws 2009,
chapter 88, article 10, section 16, increased the per acre payments made to program claimants for
fiscal year 2011 by approximately 80 percent, even though it was intended by the 2009 legislature
to have little or no effect on the per acre amount of the payments. As a result, this legislative change
provided unintended and windfall benefits to almost all the claimants.
   (b) On or before October 1, 2011, the commissioner of revenue shall pay to:
    (1) each claimant whose fiscal year 2011 payment was $100,000 under Laws 2010, First Special
Session chapter 1, article 13, section 4, subdivision 3, a transition payment equal to one-twelfth
for each month, or part of a month, of calendar year 2011 in which the claimant's covenant was in
effect, multiplied by $100,000, except that this payment must be reduced, but not below zero, by
the increase, if any, in the claimant's 2010 total payment resulting from the increase in the per acre
payment rates between 2009 and 2010; and
    (2) each claimant who was eligible for a payment in calendar year 2011 and who received no
payment for calendar year 2010, a transition payment of $3.75 per acre of land enrolled in the
program, but not to exceed the amount allowed per claimant to claimants receiving payments under
clause (1).
   Because claimants not covered by clauses (1) or (2) received much larger per acre payments
than intended for calendar year 2010, no transition payments are provided to them.
   For purposes of this paragraph (b), "claimant" refers to each Social Security number or state or
federal business tax identification number.
   (c) An amount sufficient to make the transition payments required under paragraph (b) is
appropriated to the commissioner of revenue from the general fund.
    (d) Land that had been enrolled in the sustainable forest incentive program on May 1, 2011, may
be reclassified as class 2(c) managed forest land for taxes payable in 2012 if the owner applies to
the assessor for the reclassification before September 1, 2011, notwithstanding the application date
in Minnesota Statutes, section 273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (d).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

                                         ­6­ 2013 and subsequent years, the tax rate shall be equal to
the preceding year's tax rate plus an amount equal to the preceding year's tax rate multiplied by the
percentage increase in the implicit price deflator from the fourth quarter of the second preceding
year to the fourth quarter of the preceding year. "Implicit price deflator" means the implicit price
deflator for the gross domestic product prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United
States Department of Commerce.
    (c) An additional tax is imposed equal to three cents per gross ton of merchantable iron ore
concentrate for each one percent that the iron content of the product exceeds 72 percent, when dried
at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
    (d) The tax on taconite and iron sulphides shall be imposed on the average of the production for
the current year and the previous two years. The rate of the tax imposed will be the current year's
tax rate. This clause shall not apply in the case of the closing of a taconite facility if the property
taxes on the facility would be higher if this clause and section 298.25 were not applicable. The tax
on other iron-bearing material shall be imposed on the current year production.
    (e) If the tax or any part of the tax imposed by this subdivision is held to be unconstitutional, a
tax of $

          .­ 0
             ­3
              ­ $2.380 per gross ton of merchantable iron ore concentrate produced shall be imposed.
    (f) Consistent with the intent of this subdivision to impose a tax based upon the weight of
merchantable iron ore concentrate, the commissioner of revenue may indirectly determine the
weight of merchantable iron ore concentrate included in fluxed pellets by subtracting the weight of
the limestone, dolomite, or olivine derivatives or other basic flux additives included in the pellets
from the weight of the pellets. For purposes of this paragraph, "fluxed pellets" are pellets produced
in a process in which limestone, dolomite, olivine, or other basic flux additives are combined with
merchantable iron ore concentrate. No subtraction from the weight of the pellets shall be allowed
for binders, mineral and chemical additives other than basic flux additives, or moisture.
    (g)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, for the first two years of a plant's
commercial production of direct reduced ore from ore mined in this state, no tax is imposed under
this section. As used in this paragraph, "commercial production" is production of more than 50,000
tons of direct reduced ore in the current year or in any prior year, "noncommercial production"
is production of 50,000 tons or less of direct reduced ore in any year, and "direct reduced ore" is
ore that results in a product that has an iron content of at least 75 percent. For the third year of
a plant's commercial production of direct reduced ore, the rate to be applied to direct reduced ore
is 25 percent of the rate otherwise determined under this subdivision. For the fourth commercial
production year, the rate is 50 percent of the rate otherwise determined under this subdivision; for
the fifth commercial production year, the rate is 75 percent of the rate otherwise determined under
this subdivision; and for all subsequent commercial production years, the full rate is imposed.

    (2) Subject to clause (1), production of direct reduced ore in this state is subject to the tax imposed
by this section, but if that production is not produced by a producer of taconite, iron sulfides, or other
iron-bearing material, the production of taconite, iron sulfides, or other iron-bearing material, that
is consumed in the production of direct reduced iron in this state is not subject to the tax imposed
by this section on taconite, iron sulfides, or other iron-bearing material.
    (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, no tax is imposed on direct reduced
ore under this section during the facility's noncommercial production of direct reduced ore. The
taconite or iron sulphides consumed in the noncommercial production of direct reduced ore is subject
to the tax imposed by this section on taconite and iron sulphides. Three-year average production of
direct reduced ore does not include production of direct reduced ore in any noncommercial year.
Three-year average production for a direct reduced ore facility that has noncommercial production is
the average of the commercial production of direct reduced ore for the current year and the previous
two commercial years.
   (4) This paragraph applies only to plants for which all environmental permits have been obtained
and construction has begun before July 1, 2008.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for production in 2011 and thereafter.

distributed as provided in section 298.282.
    (b) An amount must be allocated to towns or cities that is annually certified by the county auditor
of a county containing a taconite tax relief area as defined in section 273.134, paragraph (b), within
which there is (1) an organized township if, as of January 2, 1982, more than 75 percent of the
assessed valuation of the township consists of iron ore or (2) a city if, as of January 2, 1980, more
than 75 percent of the assessed valuation of the city consists of iron ore.
    (c) The amount allocated under paragraph (b) will be the portion of a township's or city's certified
levy equal to the proportion of (1) the difference between 50 percent of January 2, 1982, assessed
value in the case of a township and 50 percent of the January 2, 1980, assessed value in the case of
a city and its current assessed value to (2) the sum of its current assessed value plus the difference
determined in (1), provided that the amount distributed shall not exceed $55 per capita in the case
of a township or $75 per capita in the case of a city. For purposes of this limitation, population
will be determined according to the 1980 decennial census conducted by the United States Bureau
of the Census. If the current assessed value of the township exceeds 50 percent of the township's
January 2, 1982, assessed value, or if the current assessed value of the city exceeds 50 percent of the
city's January 2, 1980, assessed value, this paragraph shall not apply. For purposes of this paragraph,
"assessed value," when used in reference to years other than 1980 or 1982, means the appropriate
net tax capacities multiplied by 10.2.
    (d) In addition to other distributions under this subdivision, three cents per taxable ton for
distributions in 2009 must be allocated for distribution to towns that are entirely located within
the taconite tax relief area defined in section 273.134, paragraph (b). For distribution in 2010 and
subsequent years, the three-cent amount must be annually increased in the same proportion as the
increase in the implicit price deflator as provided in section 298.24, subdivision 1. The amount

available under this paragraph will be distributed to eligible towns on a per capita basis, provided
that no town may receive more than $50,000 in any year under this paragraph. Any amount of
the distribution that exceeds the $50,000 limitation for a town under this paragraph must be
redistributed on a per capita basis among the other eligible towns, to whose distributions do not
exceed $50,000.

    (a) Each district may make a levy on all taxable property located within the district for the
purposes specified in this section. The maximum amount which may be levied for all costs under
this section shall be equal to $30 multiplied by the district's adjusted marginal cost pupil units
for the school year. The proceeds of the levy must be reserved and used for directly funding the
following purposes or for reimbursing the cities and counties who contract with the district for the
following purposes: (1) to pay the costs incurred for the salaries, benefits, and transportation costs
of peace officers and sheriffs for liaison in services in the district's schools; (2) to pay the costs for
a drug abuse prevention program as defined in section 609.101, subdivision 3, paragraph (e), in the
elementary schools; (3) to pay the costs for a gang resistance education training curriculum in the
district's schools; (4) to pay the costs for security in the district's schools and on school property;
(5) to pay the costs for other crime prevention, drug abuse, student and staff safety, voluntary opt-in
suicide prevention tools, and violence prevention measures taken by the school district; or (6) to pay
costs for licensed school counselors, licensed school nurses, licensed school social workers, licensed
school psychologists, and licensed alcohol and chemical dependency counselors to help provide
early responses to problems. For expenditures under clause (1), the district must initially attempt
to contract for services to be provided by peace officers or sheriffs with the police department of
each city or the sheriff's department of the county within the district containing the school receiving
the services. If a local police department or a county sheriff's department does not wish to provide
the necessary services, the district may contract for these services with any other police or sheriff's
department located entirely or partially within the school district's boundaries.
    (b) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with safe schools activities authorized under
paragraph (a) for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed $10 times
the adjusted marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to
any other authority authorized under this section. Revenue raised under this paragraph must be
transferred to the intermediate school district.

   , must be allocated to the city or town in the county in which the lands from which taconite
was mined or quarried were located or within which the concentrate was produced. If the mining,
quarrying, and concentration, or different steps in either thereof are carried on in more than one
taxing district, the commissioner shall apportion equitably the proceeds of the part of the tax going
to cities and towns among such subdivisions upon the basis of attributing 50 percent of the proceeds
of the tax to the operation of mining or quarrying the taconite, and the remainder to the concentrating
plant and to the processes of concentration, and with respect to each thereof giving due consideration
to the relative extent of such operations performed in each such taxing district. The commissioner's
order making such apportionment shall be subject to review by the Tax Court at the instance of any
of the interested taxing districts, in the same manner as other orders of the commissioner.
    (b) Four cents per taxable ton shall be allocated to cities and organized townships affected by
mining because their boundaries are within three miles of a taconite mine pit that has been actively
mined in at least one of the prior three years. If a city or town is located near more than one mine
meeting these criteria, the city or town is eligible to receive aid calculated from only the mine
producing the largest taxable tonnage. When more than one municipality qualifies for aid based on
one company's production, the aid must be apportioned among the municipalities in proportion to
their populations. Of the amounts distributed under this paragraph to each municipality, one-half
must be used for infrastructure improvement projects, and one-half must be used for projects in
which two or more municipalities cooperate. Each municipality that receives a distribution under
this paragraph must report annually to the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board and the
commissioner of Iron Range resources and rehabilitation on the projects involving cooperation with
other municipalities.

received under this paragraph or $25 times the number of pupil units served in the district. It may

school district or charter school. School districts and charter schools must formally establish a
periodic review cycle for the academic standards and related benchmarks in health, world languages,
and career and technical education.
    (h) The commissioner is prohibited from adopting common core state standards in any subject
and school year listed in any revision cycle under this section that were developed with the
participation of the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 120B.35, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. School and student indicators of growth and achievement. The commissioner
must develop and implement a system for measuring and reporting academic achievement and
individual student growth, consistent with the statewide educational accountability and reporting
system. The system components must measure and separately report the adequate yearly progress
of schools and the growth of individual students: students' current achievement in schools under
subdivision 2; and individual students' educational growth over time under subdivision 3. The
commissioner annually must report a student's growth and progress toward grade-level proficiency
under section 120B.299 as it relates to applicable state academic standards and the statewide
assessments aligned with those standards. The system also must include statewide measures of
student academic growth that identify schools with high levels of growth, and also schools with low
levels of growth that need improvement. When determining a school's effect, the data must include
both statewide measures of student achievement and, to the extent annual tests are administered,
indicators of achievement growth that take into account a student's prior achievement. Indicators
of achievement and prior achievement must be based on highly reliable statewide or districtwide
assessments. Indicators that take into account a student's prior achievement must not be used
to disregard a school's low achievement or to exclude a school from a program to improve low
achievement levels.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2012, and applies to growth data
beginning in the 2012-2013 school year.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 120B.36, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. School performance report cards. (a) The commissioner shall report student
academic performance under section 120B.35, subdivision 2; the percentages of students showing
low, medium, and high growth under section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph (b); school
safety and student engagement and connection under section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph
(d); rigorous coursework under section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph (c); two separate
student-to-teacher ratios that clearly indicate the definition of teacher consistent with sections
122A.06 and 122A.15 for purposes of determining these ratios; staff characteristics excluding
salaries; the number of teachers in each performance effectiveness rating category under section
122A.411, subdivision 3, by school site; student enrollment demographics; district mobility; and
extracurricular activities. The report also must indicate a school's adequate yearly progress status,
and must not set any designations applicable to high- and low-performing schools due solely to
adequate yearly progress status.
   (b) The commissioner shall develop, annually update, and post on the department Web site
school performance report cards.

   (c) The commissioner must make available performance report cards by the beginning of each
school year.
   (d) A school or district may appeal its adequate yearly progress status in writing to the
commissioner within 30 days of receiving the notice of its status. The commissioner's decision to
uphold or deny an appeal is final.
    (e) School performance report card data are nonpublic data under section 13.02, subdivision 9,
until not later than ten days after the appeal procedure described in paragraph (d) concludes. The
department shall annually post school performance report cards to its public Web site no later than
September 1.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2014.
  Sec. 5. [120B.361] DISTRICT AND CHARTER SCHOOL AND SCHOOL DISTRICT
GRADING SYSTEM AND SCHOOL RECOGNITION PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. District and charter school and school district grades. (a) Consistent with the
state growth targets established under sections 120B.299 and 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraphs
(a) and (b), and the school performance report cards under section 120B.36, subdivision 1, an "A to
F" grading system for district and charter schools and school districts is established to help identify
those schools and districts where students are achieving low, medium, or high growth and achieving
or not achieving proficiency on statewide assessments under section 120B.30. For purposes of this
section, and using the state growth target, the commissioner annually must assign each district and
charter school and school district an "A to F" grade and then report that grade under section 120B.36,
subdivision 1, based on the following calculations:
    (1) 50 percent of a school's grade must be determined based on the numbers and percentages
of students in each applicable student category for which assessment data is disaggregated under
section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), clause (2), and paragraph (c), who achieved
proficiency on the statewide reading and mathematics assessments under section 120B.30 in the
previous school year;
    (2) 25 percent of a school's grade must be determined based on the numbers and percentages
of students in each applicable student category for which assessment data is disaggregated under
section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), clause (2), and paragraph (c), who achieved low
growth, medium growth, or high growth on the statewide reading and mathematics assessments
under section 120B.30 in the previous school year;
    (3) 15 percent of a school's grade must be determined based on the numbers and percentages
of students in each applicable student category for which assessment data is disaggregated under
section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), clause (2), and paragraph (c), who achieved low
growth and did not achieve proficiency on the statewide reading assessments under section 120B.30
in the previous school year;
    (4) ten percent of a school's grade must be determined based on the numbers and percentages
of students in each applicable student category for which assessment data is disaggregated under
section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), clause (2), and paragraph (c), who achieved low
growth and did not achieve proficiency on the statewide mathematics assessments under section
120B.30 in the previous school year; and

    (5) using the calculations in clauses (1) to (4), a school district's grade must be determined based
on the combined average scores of all district schools.
    (b) The grade a school or district receives under this subdivision must accurately reflect
the differences in schools' performances based on students' proficiency and growth and the
calculations required under this subdivision. A school or district may appeal its grade in writing
to the commissioner within 30 days of receiving notice of its grade. The commissioner's decision
regarding the grade is final. Grades given under this section are nonpublic data under section 13.02,
subdivision 9, until not later than ten days after the appeal under this paragraph is complete.
   Subd. 2. District and charter school recognition. (a) A school that received a letter grade of
"A" in the previous school year, improved at least one letter grade in the previous school year, or
improved two or more letter grades in the two previous school years is eligible to receive a school
recognition award.
   (b) A school recognition award under this subdivision equals $100 per enrollee for each eligible
school. The commissioner must distribute the award to each eligible school.
   (c) An eligible school that receives a school recognition award may use the award to:
   (1) pay onetime bonuses for licensed staff employed at the school;
    (2) pay onetime expenditures for educational equipment or materials to help maintain or improve
student academic achievement; or
   (3) temporarily employ licensed or otherwise qualified staff to help maintain or improve student
academic achievement.
    Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, an award a school receives under this subdivision
is not subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
    (d) To distribute the award at the school, and consistent with paragraph (c), an eligible school
may select a site team that includes at least the school principal or other person having administrative
control of the school, teachers employed at the school, the parent of a student enrolled in the school,
and a community representative to decide how best to use the award. Alternatively, if by November
1 in the year in which the award is made the site team cannot reach agreement or if no site team
is selected, the school principal or other person having administrative control of the school must
distribute the award.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and requires the
education commissioner to use student performance data beginning in the 2011-2012 school year,
determine and report a letter grade for each school and district, and distribute school recognition
awards beginning in the 2012-2013 school year and later.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.40, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3a. Qualified economic offer. (a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, if a school
board offers teachers a biennial contract that includes a percentage increase in total compensation
at least equal to the district's biennial percentage increase in basic revenue under section 126C.10,
subdivision 2, as measured by the ratio of (1) the most recent estimate of district basic revenue for
the biennium that corresponds to the prospective contract term to (2) district basic revenue for the
2654                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [59TH DAY

previous biennium; teachers may not strike for any issue relating to total compensation for the years
covered by that contract or submit any total compensation issue to interest arbitration under section
179A.16. District fund balances or other revenue sources or allocations are not to be included in any
calculation of compensation under this subdivision.
    (b) If a school board and teachers do not agree on the allocation of the total compensation offered
by the board under paragraph (a) by September 1 of an even-numbered calendar year, the allocation
of total compensation among teachers shall be as follows:
    (1) existing employee benefits must continue at the same percentage of the total compensation
and in the same manner as provided in the teachers' immediately preceding employment contract;
and
    (2) based on the percentage increase in the general education formula allowance for the biennium
for which the contract is in effect, any remaining percentage of the total compensation for the
contract period being negotiated, after subtracting the value of clause (1), is for increases in teacher
salary based on first, alternative teacher pay plans under section 122A.414; second, the number of
years of service; and third, promotion and advanced education.
    (c) For purposes of this subdivision, the following terms have the meanings given them.
    "Teachers" means classroom teachers licensed under section 122A.18. At a school board's
election, teachers also means school administrators licensed under section 122A.14, subdivision
1. A school board that elects to offer school administrators an employment contract under this
subdivision must make the offer consistent with section 179A.20 and the provisions of this
subdivision. A school board, at its discretion, also may elect to offer any of its nonlicensed
employees an employment contract under the terms of this subdivision.
    "Total compensation" means the sum of the following cost components: (i) a school district's
total salary schedule costs excluding alternative teacher compensation under sections 122A.413 to
122A.415; (ii) a school district's total salary costs of an alternative teacher professional pay system
under sections 122A.413 to 122A.415; (iii) total health insurance costs paid by the school district
for its teachers, excluding any district contributions to health reimbursement arrangements (HRA)
or health savings accounts (HSA) for teachers; (iv) total life insurance costs paid by the school
district for its teachers; (v) total long-term disability costs paid by the school district for its teachers;
(vi) total dental insurance costs paid by the school district for its teachers; (vii) total extracurricular

schedule; (ix) total Teachers Retirement Association costs paid by the school district for its teachers;
(x) total Social Security and Medicare (FICA) contribution costs paid by the school district for its

services or benefits such as special school events, extra service duty, summer school instruction,
drivers' education outside the regular school day and school year, and other direct salary payments to
teachers or fringe benefit costs paid by the school district for its teachers and not otherwise provided

experience in Minnesota in a single district is deemed to be a probationary period of employment,
and after completion thereof, the probationary period in each district in which the teacher is
thereafter employed shall be one year. The school board must adopt a plan for written evaluation
of teachers during the probationary period that complies with section 122A.411. Evaluation must
occur at least three times each year for a teacher performing services on 120 or more school days,
at least two times each year for a teacher performing services on 60 to 119 school days, and at least
one time each year for a teacher performing services on fewer than 60 school days. Days devoted
to parent-teacher conferences, teachers' workshops, and other staff development opportunities and
days on which a teacher is absent from school must not be included in determining the number of
school days on which a teacher performs services. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b),
during the probationary period any annual contract with any teacher may or may not be renewed
as the school board shall see fit. However, the board must give any ­     su

whose contract it declines to renew for the following school year written notice to that effect
before July 1. If the teacher requests reasons for any nonrenewal of a teaching contract, the board
must give the teacher its reason in writing, including a statement that appropriate supervision was
furnished describing the nature and the extent of such supervision furnished the teacher during
the employment by the board, within ten days after receiving such request. The school board may,
after a hearing held upon due notice, discharge a teacher during the probationary period for cause,
effective immediately, under section 122A.44.
    (b) A board must discharge a probationary teacher, effective immediately, upon receipt of notice
under section 122A.20, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), that the teacher's license has been revoked due
to a conviction for child abuse or sexual abuse.
    (c) A probationary teacher whose first three years of consecutive employment are interrupted for
active military service and who promptly resumes teaching consistent with federal reemployment
timelines for uniformed service personnel under United States Code, title 38, section 4312(e), is
considered to have a consecutive teaching experience for purposes of paragraph (a).
    (d) A probationary teacher must complete at least 60 days of teaching service each year during
the probationary period. Days devoted to parent-teacher conferences, teachers' workshops, and other
staff development opportunities and days on which a teacher is absent from school do not count as
days of teaching service under this paragraph.
    (e) A district must decide whether to issue a renewable five-year contract to a classroom teacher
at the end of the teacher's probationary period based on:
      (1) the teacher's appraisal results and performance effectiveness rating under section 122A.411;
and
      (2) other locally selected criteria aligned to instructional practices in teaching and learning.

      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for the 2013-2014 school year and later.
      Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.40, subdivision 11, is amended to read:
    Subd. 11. Unrequested leave of absence. (a) The board may place on unrequested leave
of absence, without pay or fringe benefits, as many teachers as may be necessary because of
discontinuance of position, lack of pupils, financial limitations, or merger of classes caused by
consolidation of districts. The unrequested leave is effective at the close of the school year.
In placing teachers on unrequested leave, the superintendent may exempt from the effects of
paragraphs (b) to (e) those teachers who, based on the teachers' effectiveness ratings under section
122A.411, are able to provide instruction that similarly licensed teachers cannot provide or whose
subject area license meets unmet district needs for student instruction. The board is governed by

    (c) A probationary teacher must complete at least 60 days of teaching service each year during
the probationary period. Days devoted to parent-teacher conferences, teachers' workshops, and other
staff development opportunities and days on which a teacher is absent from school do not count as
days of teaching service under this paragraph.
    (d) A district must decide whether to issue a renewable five-year contract to a classroom teacher
at the end of the teacher's probationary period based on:
      (1) the teacher's appraisal results and performance effectiveness rating under section 122A.411;
and
      (2) other locally selected criteria aligned to instructional practices in teaching and learning.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for the 2013-2014 school year and later.
      Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.41, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2a. Qualified economic offer. (a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, if a school
board offers teachers a biennial contract that includes a percentage increase in total compensation
at least equal to the district's biennial percentage increase in basic revenue under section 126C.10,
subdivision 2, as measured by the ratio of (1) the most recent estimate of district basic revenue for
the biennium that corresponds to the prospective contract term to (2) district basic revenue for the
previous biennium; teachers may not strike for any issue relating to total compensation for the years
covered by that contract or submit any total compensation issue to interest arbitration under section
179A.16. District fund balances or other revenue sources or allocations are not to be included in any
calculation of compensation under this subdivision.
    (b) If a school board and teachers do not agree on the allocation of the total compensation offered
by the board under paragraph (a) by September 1 of an even-numbered calendar year, the allocation
of total compensation among teachers shall be as follows:
    (1) existing employee benefits must continue at the same percentage of the total compensation
and in the same manner as provided in the teachers' immediately preceding employment contract;
and
    (2) based on the percentage increase in the general education formula allowance for the biennium
for which the contract is in effect, any remaining percentage of the total compensation for the
contract period being negotiated, after subtracting the value of clause (1), is for increases in teacher
salary based on first, alternative teacher pay plans under section 122A.414; second, the number of
years of service; and third, promotion and advanced education.
      (c) For the purposes of this subdivision, the following terms have the meanings given them.
    "Teachers" means classroom teachers licensed under section 122A.18. At a school board's
election, teachers also means school administrators licensed under section 122A.14, subdivision
1. A school board that elects to offer school administrators an employment contract under this
subdivision must make the offer consistent with section 179A.20 and the provisions of this
subdivision. A school board, at its discretion, also may elect to offer any of its nonlicensed
employees an employment contract under the terms of this subdivision.
      "Total compensation" means the sum of the following cost components: (i) a school district's

total salary schedule costs excluding alternative teacher compensation under sections 122A.413 to
122A.415; (ii) a school district's total salary costs of an alternative teacher professional pay system

for its teachers, excluding any district contributions to health reimbursement arrangements (HRA)
or health savings accounts (HSA) for teachers; (iv) total life insurance costs paid by the school
district for its teachers; (v) total long-term disability costs paid by the school district for its teachers;
(vi) total dental insurance costs paid by the school district for its teachers; (vii) total extracurricular

schedule; (ix) total Teachers Retirement Association costs paid by the school district for its teachers;
(x) total Social Security and Medicare (FICA) contribution costs paid by the school district for its
teachers; and (xi) other miscellaneous costs identified by the school district as payment for teachers'
services or benefits such as special school events, extra service duty, summer school instruction,
drivers' education outside the regular school day and school year, and other direct salary payments to
teachers or fringe benefit costs paid by the school district for its teachers and not otherwise provided
for in items (i) to (x).

they were employed by the school district;
   (2) teachers with a "needs improvement" rating under section 122A.411 in the inverse order in
which they were employed by the school district;
   (3) teachers with an "average" rating under section 122A.411 with four or more years of teaching
experience in the inverse order in which they were employed by the school district;
    (4) teachers with an "effective" rating under section 122A.411 with fewer than four years of
teaching experience in the inverse order in which they were employed by the school district; and
   (5) teachers with a "highly effective" rating under section 122A.411 in the inverse order in which
they were employed by the school district.
    The superintendent may exempt from the effects of this subdivision those teachers who, based
on the teachers' effectiveness rating under section 122A.411, are able to provide instruction that
similarly licensed teachers cannot provide or whose subject area license meets unmet district needs
for student instruction.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for the 2013-2014 school year and later.
     Sec. 20. [122A.411] TEACHER EVALUATIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Evaluation structure. A teacher evaluation structure is established to provide
information about teacher effectiveness for teachers under section 122A.06, subdivision 2, districts,
and charter schools to use in developing and improving teacher performance and student learning.
The two-part structure contains:
    (1) a teacher appraisal framework that identifies performance measures for determining teacher
effectiveness; and
    (2) a mechanism for translating the performance data into a five-part teacher effectiveness rating
scale.
    Subd. 2. Teacher appraisal framework. (a) Each school district and charter school must create
and implement a teacher appraisal framework. The framework must translate performance measures
and scores under this subdivision into five performance effectiveness rating scores where "5" is the
highest rating and "1" is the lowest rating. The framework must be designed to give an effectiveness
rating score that has 50 percent based on assessment results under paragraph (b), (c), or (d), and 50
percent based on district criteria under paragraph (e). The department, in collaboration with the
Board of Teaching, must make available to districts and charter schools appraisal frameworks and
other materials from evidence-based sources to assist districts and charter schools in implementing
an appraisal framework, consistent with this section.
    (b) If statewide assessment results are available under section 120B.35, these results are the basis
for 50 percent of a teacher's total appraisal.
2666                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [59TH DAY

   (c) If statewide assessment results are unavailable, 50 percent of a teacher's total appraisal must
consist of results from districtwide assessments of state and local standards.
    (d) If no districtwide assessment results are available, 50 percent of a teacher's total appraisal
must consist of teacher-developed and administrator-approved assessments of state and local
standards. A school administrator shall meet with teachers at least annually under this paragraph
to review, modify if needed, and approve local course and grade-level expectations for student
achievement and growth.
    (e) A charter school or a school board, in consultation with its teachers, must identify the
performance measures used as a basis for the other 50 percent of a teacher's total appraisal under
this subdivision. The appraisal must include data from parent surveys and at least one annual
evaluation performed by a trained school administrator or an administrator's trained designee.
Other performance measures may include student surveys, peer observations and review, teacher
performance portfolios, video classroom observations with teacher reflection after viewing videos,
measures approved as part of an educational improvement plan under section 122A.413, and other
highly reliable research-based measures.
    Subd. 3. Teacher performance effectiveness ratings. (a) Beginning in the 2012-2013 school
year and consistent with subdivision 2, a school district or charter school annually must use the
following scale to determine a teacher performance effectiveness rating for each teacher who teaches
a subject for which statewide assessment results are available under section 120B.35:
    (1) a teacher is "highly effective" if the teacher's appraisal shows that the teacher's students,
on average, achieved one and one-half or more years of growth on statewide assessments and the
teacher received a "5" performance rating under the district or charter school appraisal framework;
    (2) a teacher is "effective" if the teacher's appraisal shows that the teacher's students, on
average, achieved at least one year of growth on statewide assessments and the teacher received a
"4" performance rating under the district or charter school appraisal framework;
    (3) a teacher is "average" if the teacher's appraisal shows that the teacher's students, on average,
achieved at least 0.9 years of growth on statewide student assessments and the teacher received a
"3" performance rating under the district or charter school appraisal framework;
    (4) a teacher "needs improvement" if the teacher's appraisal shows that the teacher's students,
on average, achieved between 0.5 and 0.9 years of growth on statewide assessments or the teacher
received a "2" or lower performance rating under the district or charter school appraisal framework;
and
    (5) a teacher is "ineffective" if the teacher's appraisal shows that the teacher's students, on
average, achieved less than one-half year of growth on statewide assessments and the teacher
received a "1" performance rating under the district or charter school appraisal framework.
    A teacher who does not meet both the growth and performance rating requirements in any of
clauses (1) to (4) receives the next lower effectiveness rating that immediately follows the clause
where the teacher met either the growth or the performance rating requirement.
    (b) Beginning in the 2012-2013 school year and consistent with subdivision 2, a school district or
charter school annually must use a teacher performance effectiveness rating scale developed under
this paragraph for each teacher who teaches a subject for which no statewide assessment data exist.
59TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                        2667

The district or charter school, in consultation with its teachers, must define low, medium, and high
academic growth and progress toward grade-level proficiency for purposes of establishing teacher
performance effectiveness ratings so that a teacher is rated:
   (1) "highly effective" if the teacher receives a "5" performance rating under the district or charter
school appraisal framework;
   (2) "effective" if the teacher receives a "4" performance rating under the district or charter school
appraisal framework;
   (3) "average" if the teacher receives a "3" performance rating under the district or charter school
appraisal framework;
   (4) "needs improvement" if the teacher receives a "2" performance rating under the district or
charter school appraisal framework; and
   (5) "ineffective" if the teacher receives a "1" performance rating under the district or charter
school appraisal framework.
    (c) A teacher, other than a probationary teacher, who receives a highly effective or effective
performance rating under this subdivision is not subject to an appraisal under subdivision 2,
paragraph (e), in the next year after the teacher receives that rating.
    Subd. 4. Data gathering and analysis. (a) Beginning in the 2012-2013 school year, the
department, in consultation with the Board of Teaching, shall assist a school district or charter
school in collecting and aggregating student data needed to implement subdivisions 2 and 3.
If the school district or charter school and the department agree that an ongoing need exists
for department assistance, the district or charter school and the department shall enter into a
data-sharing agreement. Any data on individual students or teachers received, collected, or created
that are used to generate summary data under this section are nonpublic data under chapter 13.
    (b) Beginning in 2014, the department annually by June 30 shall submit summary data on
teachers' effectiveness under paragraph (a) to the Minnesota teacher preparation program or
institution that prepared the teachers covered in that year's district and charter school reports to the
department.
   Subd. 5. Reports. (a) Beginning in the 2012-2013 school year, each school district and charter
school annually shall report to the department by July 15 the following information about the school
year just completed:
   (1) each teacher's performance effectiveness rating determined under both subdivision 2,
paragraph (b), (c), or (d), and subdivision 3, paragraph (a) or (b);
   (2) each teacher's professional preparation program;
   (3) its appraisal framework; and
   (4) its graduation rate.
    (b) Beginning in 2014, the department annually by February 15 shall submit a report to the
committees of the legislature with primary jurisdiction over kindergarten through grade 12 education
policy and finance that analyzes and evaluates summary data generated under paragraph (a) to

recognized experts in teacher evaluation and assessment who alone shall serve six-year terms.
    (b) The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall serve as a nonvoting member of
the task force and shall provide technical assistance to the task force upon request. The terms,
compensation, and removal of advisory task force members shall be as provided in section 15.059,
except that the task force shall continue until it is specifically terminated by the legislature and
operate as otherwise specified under this section. The commissioner may reimburse task force
members from the department's current operating budget but may not compensate task force
members for task force activities. The task force annually must:
   (1) recommend changes needed to more effectively implement the teacher appraisal framework
and teacher evaluation process under section 122A.411, including statutory changes needed to
accomplish its recommendations; and

122A.413 and 122A.415, the department must prepare and transmit to interested school districts,
intermediate school districts, school sites, and charter schools a standard form for applying to
participate in the alternative teacher professional pay system. The commissioner annually must
establish at least three dates as deadlines by which interested applicants must submit an application
to the commissioner under this section. An interested school district, intermediate school district,
school site, or charter school must submit to the commissioner a completed application executed
by the district superintendent and the exclusive bargaining representative of the teachers if the
applicant is a school district, intermediate school district, or school site, or executed by the
charter school board of directors if the applicant is a charter school. The application must include
the proposed alternative teacher professional pay system agreement under subdivision 2. The
department must review a completed application within 30 business days of the most recent
application deadline and recommend to the commissioner whether to approve or disapprove the
application. The commissioner must approve applications on a first-come, first-served basis. The
applicant's alternative teacher professional pay system agreement must be legally binding on the
applicant and the collective bargaining representative before the applicant receives alternative
compensation revenue. The commissioner must approve or disapprove an application based on the
requirements under subdivisions 2 and 2a.
    (b) If the commissioner disapproves an application, the commissioner must give the applicant
timely notice of the specific reasons in detail for disapproving the application. The applicant may
revise and resubmit its application and related documents to the commissioner within 30 business
days of receiving notice of the commissioner's disapproval and the commissioner must approve or
disapprove the revised application, consistent with this subdivision. Applications that are revised
and then approved are considered submitted on the date the applicant initially submitted the
application.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

development resources and plans, including those under sections 122A.414, if applicable,
and 122A.60. The model must be designed to improve teaching and learning by supporting
administrators in shaping the school's professional environment and developing teacher quality,
performance, and effectiveness. The model must, at a minimum:
   (1) support and improve administrators' instructional leadership and organizational,
management, and professional development; and strengthen their capacity in instruction and
supervision and in teacher evaluation and development under section 122A.411;
    (2) provide professional development that emphasizes improved teaching and learning,
curriculum and instruction, student learning, and a collaborative professional culture;
    (3) make appropriate recommendations for administrators to participate in development
opportunities, including the Principals' Leadership Institute under section 122A.74 and other
statewide development programs that support administrators' leadership behaviors and practices,
rigorous curriculum, school performance, and high quality instruction; and
    (4) use formative and summative assessments, on-the-job evaluations, surveys, and longitudinal
data on student academic growth as evaluation components; and provide professional development
opportunities targeted at identifying systemic strengths and weaknesses and administrators'
strengths and weaknesses in exercising leadership in pursuit of school success.
   The provisions of this section are intended to provide districts with sufficient flexibility to
accommodate district needs and goals, consistent with section 122A.411.

employment contract must not exceed a period of three years. A board, at its discretion, may or may
not renew an employment contract. A board must not, by action or inaction, extend the duration
of an existing employment contract. Beginning 365 days prior to the expiration date of an existing
employment contract, a board may negotiate and enter into a subsequent employment contract to
take effect upon the expiration of the existing contract. A subsequent contract must be contingent
upon the employee completing the terms of an existing contract. If a contract between a board and a
superintendent is terminated prior to the date specified in the contract, the board may not enter into
another superintendent contract with that same individual that has a term that extends beyond the
date specified in the terminated contract. A board may terminate a superintendent during the term
of an employment contract for any of the grounds specified in section 122A.40, subdivision 9 or
13. A superintendent shall not rely upon an employment contract with a board to assert any other
continuing contract rights in the position of superintendent under section 122A.40. Notwithstanding
the provisions of sections 122A.40, subdivision 10 or 11, 123A.32, 123A.75, or any other law to
the contrary, no individual shall have a right to employment as a superintendent based on order of
employment in any district. If two or more districts enter into an agreement for the purchase or
sharing of the services of a superintendent, the contracting districts have the absolute right to select
one of the individuals employed to serve as superintendent in one of the contracting districts and
no individual has a right to employment as the superintendent to provide all or part of the services
based on order of employment in a contracting district. The superintendent of a district shall perform
the following:
   (1) visit and supervise the schools in the district, report and make recommendations about their
condition when advisable or on request by the board;
   (2) recommend to the board employment and dismissal of teachers;
    (3) annually evaluate each school principal assigned responsibility for supervising a school
building within the district, consistent with section 122A.73;

may contract for other services. The school may discharge teachers and nonlicensed employees.
The school must create and implement a teacher evaluation structure under section 122A.411 to
use in developing and improving teacher performance and student learning. Teacher evaluations
undertaken under this paragraph do not create additional due process rights for teachers employed

    Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 124D.11, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Building lease aid. When a charter school finds it economically advantageous to rent
or lease a building or land for any instructional purposes and it determines that the total operating
capital revenue under section 126C.10, subdivision 13, is insufficient for this purpose, it may apply
to the commissioner for building lease aid for this purpose. The commissioner must review and
either approve or deny a lease aid application using the following criteria:
    (1) the reasonableness of the price based on current market values;
    (2) the extent to which the lease conforms to applicable state laws and rules; and
    (3) the appropriateness of the proposed lease in the context of the space needs and financial
circumstances of the charter school.

utility, or other operating costs. The amount of building lease aid per pupil unit served for a charter
school for any year shall not exceed the lesser of (a) 90 percent of the approved cost or (b) the
product of the pupil units served for the current school year times ­h                   t­­

     (c) The district must recognize the full amount of this levy as revenue for the fiscal year in which
it is certified.
   (d) The amount of the levy certified under this subdivision may not exceed $17,600,000 for taxes

   Sec. 49. [124D.855] SCHOOL SEGREGATION PROHIBITED.
   The state, consistent with section 123B.30 and chapter 363A, does not condone separating
school children of different socioeconomic, demographic, ethnic, or racial backgrounds into distinct
public schools. Instead, the state's interest lies in offering children a diverse and nondiscriminatory
educational experience.
   Sec. 50. [124D.975] INNOVATION ACHIEVEMENT TRANSITION REVENUE.
  Subdivision 1. Purpose. Innovation achievement transition revenue received under this section
must be spent on research-based activities designed to increase student achievement.
     Subd. 2. Innovation achievement transition revenue. A school district's innovation
achievement transition revenue equals the sum of its innovation achievement transition levy and
its innovation achievement transition aid.
   Subd. 3. Innovation achievement transition levy allowance. A district's innovation
achievement transition levy allowance equals its levy authority under section 124D.86, for taxes
payable in 2011, divided by its adjusted average daily membership for fiscal year 2012.
    Subd. 4. Innovation achievement transition levy. A district's innovation achievement

achievement transition aid equals the amount of aid the district would have received for fiscal year
2012 under Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 124D.86, for that year. For fiscal year 2013 and later,
innovation achievement transition aid equals the district's adjusted average daily membership for
that year, times $180 for Special School District No. 1, Minneapolis, $180 for Independent School
District No. 625, St. Paul, and $50 for Independent School District No. 709, Duluth.
   Subd. 6. Aid reduction. Innovation achievement transition aid for fiscal year 2012 is reduced
by $2,514,000 for Special School District No. 1, Minneapolis, $2,247,000 for Independent School
District No. 625, St. Paul, and $61,000 for Independent School District No. 709, Duluth.
   Sec. 51. [124D.98] LITERACY INCENTIVE AID.
    Subdivision 1. Literacy incentive aid. In fiscal year 2013 and later, a district's literacy incentive
aid equals the sum of the proficiency aid under subdivision 2, and the growth aid under subdivision
3.
    Subd. 2. Proficiency aid. In fiscal year 2013 and later, the proficiency aid for each school is
equal to the product of the school's proficiency allowance times the number of pupils at the school
on October 1 of the previous fiscal year. A school's proficiency allowance is equal to the percentage
of students in each building that meet or exceed proficiency on the third grade reading Minnesota
Comprehensive Assessment, averaged across the previous three test administrations, times $100.
    Subd. 3. Growth aid. In fiscal year 2013 and later, the growth aid for each school is equal to
the product of the school's growth allowance times the number of pupils enrolled at the school
on October 1 of the previous fiscal year. A school's growth allowance is equal to the percentage
of students at that school making medium or high growth, under section 120B.299, on the fourth
grade reading Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment, averaged across the previous three test
administrations, times $100.
   Sec. 52. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 179A.16, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Nonessential employees. An exclusive representative or an employer of a
unit of employees other than essential employees or teachers may request interest arbitration by
providing written notice of the request to the other party and the commissioner. The written request
for arbitration must specify the items to be submitted to arbitration and whether conventional,
final-offer total-package, or final-offer item-by-item arbitration is contemplated by the request.
    The items to be submitted to arbitration and the form of arbitration to be used are subject to
mutual agreement. If an agreement to arbitrate is reached, it must be reduced to writing and a copy
of the agreement filed with the commissioner. A failure to respond, or to reach agreement on the
items or form of arbitration, within 15 days of receipt of the request to arbitrate constitutes a rejection
of the request.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective beginning July 1, 2013, and applies to all teacher
collective bargaining agreements entered into or modified after that date.
   Sec. 53. [179A.175] TEACHER CONTRACTS.
   Notwithstanding section 179A.16 and any other law to the contrary, a school board and the
exclusive representative of the teachers may meet and negotiate and enter into an employment
contract between March 15 and October 15 in an odd-numbered year. If the school board and

the exclusive representative fail to reach a certified written agreement by October 15 in the
odd-numbered year, the negotiations must be suspended until the next even-numbered calendar year
and resume during the three-month period preceding September 1 when school is not in session.
During the time the negotiations are suspended, employee compensation must be according to the
terms of the collective bargaining agreement in effect in the preceding collective bargaining cycle.
If agreement is not reached during the three-month period in the even-numbered year, the school
board must submit the matter to an arbitrator selected by the Bureau of Mediation Services who
must determine the matter based on a final offer total package from each party. The arbitrator's
award must not cause a structural imbalance in a district's budget during the contract term that is
subject to the arbitrator's award under this section. An award will not cause a structural imbalance
only if district expenditures do not exceed available revenue, taking into account current state aid
formulas and reasonable and comprehensive calculations and projections of the district's ongoing
revenues and expenditures during the contract term. Onetime revenue must not be considered when
calculating or projecting available revenue for ongoing expenditures in a contract term.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective beginning July 1, 2013, and applies to all teacher
collective bargaining agreements entered into or modified after that date.
    Sec. 54. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 179A.18, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. When authorized. Essential employees and teachers may not strike. Except as
otherwise provided by subdivision 2 and section 179A.17, subdivision 2, other public employees
may strike only under the following circumstances:
   (1)(i) the collective bargaining agreement between their exclusive representative and their
employer has expired or, if there is no agreement, impasse under section 179A.17, subdivision 2,
has occurred; and
    (ii) the exclusive representative and the employer have participated in mediation over a period
of at least 45 days, provided that the mediation period established by section 179A.17, subdivision
2, governs negotiations under that section, and provided that for the purposes of this subclause the
mediation period commences on the day following receipt by the commissioner of a request for
mediation; or
    (2) the employer violates section 179A.13, subdivision 2, clause (9); or
    (3) in the case of state employees, (i) the Legislative Coordinating Commission has rejected a
negotiated agreement or arbitration decision during a legislative interim; or (ii) the entire legislature
rejects or fails to ratify a negotiated agreement or arbitration decision, which has been approved
during a legislative interim by the Legislative Coordinating Commission, at a special legislative
session called to consider it, or at its next regular legislative session, whichever occurs first.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective beginning July 1, 2013, and applies to all teacher
collective bargaining agreements entered into or modified after that date.
    Sec. 55. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 179A.18, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Notice. In addition to the other requirements of this section, no employee may strike
unless written notification of intent to strike is served on the employer and the commissioner by the
exclusive representative at least ten days prior to the commencement of the strike. For all employees

   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 125A.21, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Third-party reimbursement. (a) Beginning July 1, 2000, districts shall seek
reimbursement from insurers and similar third parties for the cost of services provided by the
district whenever the services provided by the district are otherwise covered by the child's health
coverage. Districts shall request, but may not require, the child's family to provide information
about the child's health coverage when a child with a disability begins to receive services from
the district of a type that may be reimbursable, and shall request, but may not require, updated
information after that as needed.
    (b) For children enrolled in medical assistance under chapter 256B or MinnesotaCare under
chapter 256L who have no other health coverage, a district shall provide an initial and annual
written notice to the enrolled child's parent or legal representative of its intent to seek reimbursement
from medical assistance or MinnesotaCare for the ­n   i­d

health-related services provided by the district. The initial notice must give the child's parent or legal
representative the right to:
   (1) request a copy of the child's education records on the health-related services that the district
provided to the child and disclosed to a third-party payer;
   (2) withdraw consent for the district to disclose information in a child's education record at any
time without affecting a parent's eligibility for MinnesotaCare or medical assistance under section
256B.08, subdivision 1, including consent that the parent or legal representative gave as part of the
application process for MinnesotaCare or medical assistance; and
   (3) receive a statement, consistent with clause (2), indicating that a decision to withdraw
consent for the district to disclose information in a child's education record does not affect a
parent's eligibility for MinnesotaCare or medical assistance.
   (c) The district shall give the parent or legal representative annual written notice of:
    (1) the district's intent to seek reimbursement from medical assistance or MinnesotaCare for
individual education plan health-related services provided by the district;
    (2) the right of the parent or legal representative to request a copy of all records concerning
individual education plan health-related services disclosed by the district to any third party; and
    (3) the right of the parent or legal representative to withdraw consent for disclosure of a child's
records at any time without consequence, including consent that the parent or legal representative
gave as part of the application process for any public assistance program that may result in a parent's
eligibility for MinnesotaCare or medical assistance under section 256B.08, subdivision 1.

The written notice shall be provided as part of the written notice required by Code of Federal
Regulations, title 34, section 300.504. The district must ensure that the parent of a child with a
disability is given notice, in understandable language, of federal and state procedural safeguards
available to the parent under this paragraph and paragraph (b).
    (d) In order to access the private health care coverage of a child who is covered by private health
care coverage in whole or in part, a district must:
   (1) obtain annual written informed consent from the parent or legal representative, in compliance
with subdivision 5; and
    (2) inform the parent or legal representative that a refusal to permit the district or state Medicaid
agency to access their private health care coverage does not relieve the district of its responsibility
to provide all services necessary to provide free and appropriate public education at no cost to the
parent or legal representative.
    (e) If the commissioner of human services obtains federal approval to exempt covered
individual education plan health-related services from the requirement that private health care
coverage refuse payment before medical assistance may be billed, paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) shall
also apply to students with a combination of private health care coverage and health care coverage
through medical assistance or MinnesotaCare.
    (f) In the event that Congress or any federal agency or the Minnesota legislature or any state
agency establishes lifetime limits, limits for any health care services, cost-sharing provisions, or
otherwise provides that individual education plan health-related services impact benefits for persons
enrolled in medical assistance or MinnesotaCare, the amendments to this subdivision adopted in
2002 are repealed on the effective date of any federal or state law or regulation that imposes the
limits. In that event, districts must obtain informed consent consistent with this subdivision as it
existed prior to the 2002 amendments and subdivision 5, before seeking reimbursement for children
enrolled in medical assistance under chapter 256B or MinnesotaCare under chapter 256L who have
no other health care coverage.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 125A.21, subdivision 3, is amended to read:

    (1) It must be decided by the individual education planning team that education in regular or
special education classes in the pupil's district of residence cannot be achieved satisfactorily because
of the nature and severity of the deafness or blindness or visual impairment respectively.
  (2) It must be decided by the individual education planning team that the academy provides the
most appropriate placement within the least restrictive alternative for the pupil.
   (b) A deaf or hard-of-hearing child or a visually impaired pupil may be admitted to get
socialization skills or on a short-term basis for skills development.
    (c) A parent of a child who resides in Minnesota and who meets the disability criteria for being
deaf or hard of hearing, blind or visually impaired, or multiply disabled may apply to place the
child in the Minnesota State Academies. Academy staff must review the application to determine
whether the Minnesota State Academies is an appropriate placement for the child. If academy staff
determine that the Minnesota State Academies is an appropriate placement, the staff must invite
the individualized education program team at the child's resident school district to participate in
a meeting to arrange a trial placement of between 60 and 90 calendar days at the Minnesota State
Academies. If the child's parent consents to the trial placement, the Minnesota State Academies is the
responsible serving school district and incurs all due process obligations under law, and the child's
resident school district is responsible for any transportation included in the child's individualized
education program during the trial placement. Before the trial placement ends, academy staff must
convene an individualized education program team meeting to determine whether to continue the
child's placement at the Minnesota State Academies or that another placement is appropriate. If the
academy members of the individualized education program team and the parent are unable to agree
on the child's placement, the child's placement reverts to the placement in the child's individualized
education program that immediately preceded the trial placement. If the parent and individualized
education program team agree to continue the placement beyond the trial period, the transportation
and due process responsibilities are the same as those described for the trial placement under this
paragraph.

shall include on new and revised Minnesota health care program application forms, including
electronic application forms, an authorization for consent that, if signed by the parent or legal
representative of a child receiving health-related services through an individualized education
program or an individual family services plan, would allow the school district or other provider of
covered services to release information from the child's education record to the commissioner to
permit the provider to be reimbursed by MinnesotaCare or medical assistance. The authorization
for consent under this paragraph must conform to federal data practices law governing access to
nonpublic data in a child's education record and indicate that the parent or legal representative of
the child may withdraw his or her consent at any time without any consequence to the parent or
child. The commissioner must include this authorization for consent on an application form at the
time the commissioner reviews, revises, or replaces the form.

    (1) summarize and document school district efforts to secure reimbursement from legally liable
third parties; and
    (2) request initial and continuing waivers of the requirement to seek payment from a child's
private health plan, consistent with Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 433.139, chapter
IV, part 433, based on the determination by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that this
requirement is not cost-effective. The waiver request must seek permission for the commissioner to
allow school districts to bill Medicaid alone, without first billing private payers, when a child has
both public and private coverage.
    (b) If the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not grant ongoing permission to
implement paragraph (a), clause (2), the commissioner of human services shall seek permission
to implement clause (2) on a time-limited basis, with the opportunity to renew this time-limited
permission as needed.

Accounting and Reporting Standards (UFARS) finance code, by fiscal year. Upon approval through
the adoption of a resolution by each of an intermediate district's member school district boards and
the approval of the Department of Education, a school district may include its proportionate share
of the costs of health and safety projects for an intermediate district in its application.
    (b) Health and safety projects with an estimated cost of $500,000 or more per site are not eligible
for health and safety revenue. Health and safety projects with an estimated cost of $500,000 or more
per site that meet all other requirements for health and safety funding, are eligible for alternative
facilities bonding and levy revenue according to section 123B.59. A school board shall not separate
portions of a single project into components to qualify for health and safety revenue, and shall not
combine unrelated projects into a single project to qualify for alternative facilities bonding and levy
revenue.
   (c) The commissioner of education shall not make eligibility for health and safety revenue
contingent on a district's compliance status, level of program development, or training. The
commissioner shall not mandate additional performance criteria such as training, certifications, or
compliance evaluations as a prerequisite for levy approval.

   Subd. 3. Health and safety revenue. A district's health and safety revenue for a fiscal year
equals the district's alternative facilities levy under section 123B.59, subdivision 5, paragraph (b),
plus the greater of zero or:
    (1) the sum of (a) the total approved cost of the district's hazardous substance plan for fiscal
years 1985 through 1989, plus (b) the total approved cost of the district's health and safety program
for fiscal year 1990 through the fiscal year to which the levy is attributable, excluding expenditures
funded with bonds issued under section 123B.59 or 123B.62, or chapter 475; certificates of
indebtedness or capital notes under section 123B.61; levies under section 123B.58, 123B.59,
123B.63, or 126C.40, subdivision 1 or 6; and other federal, state, or local revenues, minus
    (2) the sum of (a) the district's total hazardous substance aid and levy for fiscal years 1985
through 1989 under sections 124.245 and 275.125, subdivision 11c, plus (b) the district's health and
safety revenue under this subdivision, for years before the fiscal year to which the levy is attributable.
    Subd. 4. Health and safety levy. To receive health and safety revenue, a district may levy an
amount equal to the district's health and safety revenue as defined in subdivision 3 multiplied by
the lesser of one, or the ratio of the quotient derived by dividing the adjusted net tax capacity of the
district for the year preceding the year the levy is certified by the adjusted marginal cost pupil units
in the district for the school year to which the levy is attributable, to $2,935.
    Subd. 5. Health and safety aid. A district's health and safety aid is the difference between its
health and safety revenue and its health and safety levy. If a district does not levy the entire amount
permitted, health and safety aid must be reduced in proportion to the actual amount levied. Health
and safety aid may not be reduced as a result of reducing a district's health and safety levy according
to section 123B.79.

subdivision 6, health and safety revenue must not be used:

payments agreement;
   (2) for the construction of new facilities, remodeling of existing facilities, or the purchase of
portable classrooms;
      (3) for interest or other financing expenses;
    (4) for energy-efficiency projects under section 123B.65, for a building or property or part of a
building or property used for postsecondary instruction or administration or for a purpose unrelated
to elementary and secondary education;
    (5) for replacement of building materials or facilities including roof, walls, windows, internal
fixtures and flooring, nonhealth and safety costs associated with demolition of facilities, structural
repair or replacement of facilities due to unsafe conditions, violence prevention and facility security,
ergonomics, or public announcement systems and emergency communication devices; or

engineering or construction of a project shall be included in the health, safety, and environmental
management costs in subdivision 8, paragraph (a).
    Subd. 6b. Health and safety projects. (a) Health and safety revenue applications defined in
subdivision 1 must be accompanied by a description of each project for which funding is being
requested. Project descriptions must provide enough detail for an auditor to determine if the work
qualifies for revenue. For projects other than fire and life safety projects, playground projects,
and health, safety, and environmental management activities, a project description does not need
to include itemized details such as material types, room locations, square feet, names, or license
numbers. The commissioner may request supporting information and shall approve only projects
that comply with subdivisions 6 and 8, as defined by the Department of Education.
   (b) Districts may request funding for allowable projects based on self-assessments, safety
committee recommendations, insurance inspections, management assistance reports, fire marshal
orders, or other mandates. Notwithstanding subdivision 1, paragraph (b), and subdivision 8,
paragraph (b), for projects under $500,000, individual project size for projects authorized by this
subdivision is not limited and may include related work in multiple facilities. Health and safety
management costs from subdivision 8 may be reported as a single project.
   (c) All costs directly related to a project shall be reported in the appropriate Uniform Financial
Accounting and Reporting Standards (UFARS) finance code.
    (d) For fire and life safety egress and all other projects exceeding $20,000, cited under Minnesota
Fire Code, a fire marshal plan review is required.
   (e) Districts shall update project estimates with actual expenditures for each fiscal year. If a
project's final cost is significantly higher than originally approved, the commissioner may request
additional supporting information.
    Subd. 6c. Appeals process. In the event a district is denied funding approval for a project the
district believes complies with subdivisions 6 and 8, and is not otherwise excluded, a district may
appeal the decision. All such requests must be in writing. The commissioner shall respond in writing.
A written request must contain the following: project number; description and amount; reason for
denial; unresolved questions for consideration; reasons for reconsideration; and a specific statement
of what action the district is requesting.
    Subd. 7. Proration. In the event that the health and safety aid available for any year is prorated,
a district having its aid prorated may levy an additional amount equal to the amount not paid by the
state due to proration.
   Subd. 8. Health, safety, and environmental management cost. (a) "Health, safety, and
environmental management" is defined in section 123B.56.
   (b) A district's cost for health, safety, and environmental management is limited to the lesser of:
   (1) actual cost to implement their plan; or
   (2) an amount determined by the commissioner, based on enrollment, building age, and size.

    ­­) (c) The department may contract with regional service organizations, private contractors,
Minnesota Safety Council, or state agencies to provide management assistance to school districts for

     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 123B.63, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Capital project levy referendum. (a) A district may levy the local tax rate approved
by a majority of the electors voting on the question to provide funds for an approved project. The
election must take place no more than five years before the estimated date of commencement of
the project. The referendum must be held on a date set by the board. A referendum for a project
not receiving a positive review and comment by the commissioner under section 123B.71 must be
approved by at least 60 percent of the voters at the election.
     (b) The referendum may be called by the school board and may be held:
   (1) separately, before an election for the issuance of obligations for the project under chapter
475; or
   (2) in conjunction with an election for the issuance of obligations for the project under chapter
475; or
    (3) notwithstanding section 475.59, as a conjunctive question authorizing both the capital project
levy and the issuance of obligations for the project under chapter 475. Any obligations authorized
for a project may be issued within five years of the date of the election.
    (c) The ballot must provide a general description of the proposed project, state the estimated total
cost of the project, state whether the project has received a positive or negative review and comment
from the commissioner, state the maximum amount of the capital project levy as a percentage of
net tax capacity, state the amount that will be raised by that local tax rate in the first year it is to be
levied, and state the maximum number of years that the levy authorization will apply.
   The ballot must contain a textual portion with the information required in this section and a
question stating substantially the following:
   "Shall the capital project levy proposed by the board of .......... School District No. .......... be
approved?"
    If approved, the amount provided by the approved local tax rate applied to the net tax capacity
for the year preceding the year the levy is certified may be certified for the number of years, not to
exceed ten, approved.
   (d) If the district proposes a new capital project to begin at the time the existing capital project
expires and at the same maximum tax rate, the general description on the ballot may state that the
capital project levy is being renewed and that the tax rate is not being increased from the previous

year's rate. An election to renew authority under this paragraph may be called at any time that is
otherwise authorized by this subdivision. The ballot notice required under section 275.60 may be
modified to read:
  "BY VOTING YES ON THIS BALLOT QUESTION, YOU ARE VOTING TO RENEW AN
EXISTING CAPITAL PROJECTS REFERENDUM THAT IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE."
    (e) In the event a conjunctive question proposes to authorize both the capital project levy and the
issuance of obligations for the project, appropriate language authorizing the issuance of obligations
must also be included in the question.
   (f) The district must notify the commissioner of the results of the referendum.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment for referenda
conducted on or after the 53rd day following final enactment.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 126C.40, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. To lease building or land. (a) When an independent or a special school district
or a group of independent or special school districts finds it economically advantageous to rent
or lease a building or land for any instructional purposes or for school storage or furniture repair,
and it determines that the operating capital revenue authorized under section 126C.10, subdivision
13, is insufficient for this purpose, it may apply to the commissioner for permission to make an
additional capital expenditure levy for this purpose. An application for permission to levy under
this subdivision must contain financial justification for the proposed levy, the terms and conditions
of the proposed lease, and a description of the space to be leased and its proposed use.
    (b) The criteria for approval of applications to levy under this subdivision must include: the
reasonableness of the price, the appropriateness of the space to the proposed activity, the feasibility
of transporting pupils to the leased building or land, conformity of the lease to the laws and rules
of the state of Minnesota, and the appropriateness of the proposed lease to the space needs and the
financial condition of the district. The commissioner must not authorize a levy under this subdivision
in an amount greater than the cost to the district of renting or leasing a building or land for approved
purposes. The proceeds of this levy must not be used for custodial or other maintenance services.
A district may not levy under this subdivision for the purpose of leasing or renting a district-owned
building or site to itself.
    (c) For agreements finalized after July 1, 1997, a district may not levy under this subdivision
for the purpose of leasing: (1) a newly constructed building used primarily for regular kindergarten,
elementary, or secondary instruction; or (2) a newly constructed building addition or additions used
primarily for regular kindergarten, elementary, or secondary instruction that contains more than 20
percent of the square footage of the previously existing building.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), a district may levy under this subdivision for the purpose
of leasing or renting a district-owned building or site to itself only if the amount is needed by the
district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement, installment purchase agreement,
or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, and the levy meets the requirements of
paragraph (c). A levy authorized for a district by the commissioner under this paragraph may be
in the amount needed by the district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement,
installment purchase agreement, or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, provided

that any agreement include a provision giving the school districts the right to terminate the agreement
annually without penalty.
    (e) The total levy under this subdivision for a district for any year must not exceed $150 times
the resident pupil units for the fiscal year to which the levy is attributable.
   (f) For agreements for which a review and comment have been submitted to the Department of
Education after April 1, 1998, the term "instructional purpose" as used in this subdivision excludes
expenditures on stadiums.
   (g) The commissioner of education may authorize a school district to exceed the limit in
paragraph (e) if the school district petitions the commissioner for approval. The commissioner
shall grant approval to a school district to exceed the limit in paragraph (e) for not more than five
years if the district meets the following criteria:
   (1) the school district has been experiencing pupil enrollment growth in the preceding five years;
   (2) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term public interest;
   (3) the purpose of the increased levy promotes colocation of government services; and
   (4) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term interest of the district by avoiding over
construction of school facilities.
    (h) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with leases of administrative and classroom space
for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed $43 times the adjusted
marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to any other authority
authorized under this section.
     (i) In addition to the allowable capital levies in paragraph (a), for taxes payable in 2012 to 2022,

    Subd. 3. Procedures for polling place rosters. The secretary of state shall prescribe the form
of polling place rosters that include the voter's name, address, date of birth, school district number,
and space for the voter's signature. The address listed on the polling place roster must be the voter's
address of residence, unless the voter has requested that the address printed on the roster be the
voter's mailing address because the voter is a judge, or a law enforcement or corrections officer.
The secretary of state may prescribe additional election-related information to be placed on the
polling place rosters on an experimental basis for one state primary and general election cycle; the
same information may not be placed on the polling place roster for a second state primary and
general election cycle unless specified in this subdivision. The polling place roster must be used
to indicate whether the voter has voted in a given election. The secretary of state shall prescribe
procedures for transporting the polling place rosters to the election judges for use on election day.
The secretary of state shall prescribe the form for a county or municipality to request the date of
birth from currently registered voters. The county or municipality shall not request the date of birth
from currently registered voters by any communication other than the prescribed form and the form
must clearly indicate that a currently registered voter does not lose registration status by failing to
provide the date of birth. In accordance with section 204B.40, the county auditor shall retain the
prescribed polling place rosters used on the date of election for 22 months following the election.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 204B.21, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Appointing authority; powers and duties. Election judges for precincts in a
municipality shall be appointed by the governing body of the municipality. Election judges for
precincts in unorganized territory and for performing election-related duties assigned by the
county auditor shall be appointed by the county board. Election judges for a precinct composed
of two or more municipalities must be appointed by the governing body of the municipality or
municipalities responsible for appointing election judges as provided in the agreement to combine
for election purposes. Except as otherwise provided in this section, appointments shall be made
from lists furnished pursuant to subdivision 1 subject to the eligibility requirements and other
qualifications established or authorized under section 204B.19. At least two election judges in each
precinct must be affiliated with different major political parties. If no lists have been furnished
or if additional election judges are required after all listed names in that municipality have been
exhausted, the appointing authority may appoint other individuals who meet the qualifications to
serve as an election judge, including persons who are not affiliated with a major political party.
The appointments shall be made at least 25 days before the election at which the election judges
will serve, except that the appointing authority may pass a resolution authorizing the appointment
of additional election judges within the 25 days before the election if the appointing authority
determines that additional election judges will be required. Notwithstanding any other provision
of law, an individual serving only as an election judge, is not an employee of a school district,
regardless of whether an office of the school district appears on the ballot in the precinct at the
election.
   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 204C.10, is amended to read:
   204C.10 PERMANENT REGISTRATION; VERIFICATION OF REGISTRATION.
    Subdivision 1. Polling place roster. (a) In precincts using paper rosters, an individual seeking
to vote shall sign a polling place roster which states that the individual is at least 18 years of age,
a citizen of the United States, has resided in Minnesota for 20 days immediately preceding the
election, maintains residence at the address shown, is not under a guardianship in which the court

order revokes the individual's right to vote, has not been found by a court of law to be legally
incompetent to vote or has the right to vote because, if the individual was convicted of a felony,
the felony sentence has expired or been completed or the individual has been discharged from
the sentence, is registered and has not already voted in the election. The roster must also state:
"I understand that deliberately providing false information is a felony punishable by not more than
five years imprisonment and a fine of not more than $10,000, or both." In precincts using electronic
rosters, an individual seeking to vote shall sign a printed voter's receipt generated from an electronic
roster that meets the standards provided in section 201.225, subdivision 2.

                     , Before the applicant signs the roster or a printed voter's receipt generated from
an electronic roster, a judge must: (1) require the voter to present a photo identification document, as
described in subdivision 2; and (2) confirm the applicant's name, address, and date of birth. A voter
who cannot produce sufficient identification as required by subdivision 2 may not sign the polling
place roster, but may cast a provisional ballot, as provided in section 204C.135.
    (c) In precincts using paper rosters, after the applicant signs the roster, the judge shall give the
applicant a voter's receipt. In all precincts, the voter shall deliver the voter's receipt to the judge in
charge of ballots as proof of the voter's right to vote, and thereupon the judge shall hand to the voter
the ballot. The voters' receipts must be maintained ­   du  i­­

provided in section 204C.135.
     Sec. 26. [204C.135] PROVISIONAL BALLOTS.
    Subdivision 1. Casting of provisional ballots. (a) The following voters seeking to vote are
entitled to cast a provisional ballot in the manner provided by this section:
     (1) a voter who is unable to provide proper photo identification as required by section 204C.10;
   (2) a voter whose registration status is listed as "challenged" on the polling place roster and who
has not proven the voter's eligibility to vote in the precinct; and
   (3) a voter whose eligibility to vote is challenged in the polling place and who is unable to
overcome the challenge as permitted by section 204C.12.
    (b) A voter seeking to vote a provisional ballot must sign a provisional ballot roster and complete
a provisional ballot envelope. The envelope must contain a space for the voter to list the voter's
name, address of residence, date of birth, voter identification number, and any other information
prescribed by the secretary of state. The voter must also swear or affirm, in writing, that the voter is
eligible to vote, has not voted previously in the same election, and meets the criteria for registering
to vote in the precinct in which the voter appears.
    Once the voter has completed the provisional ballot envelope, the voter must be allowed to cast
a provisional ballot. The provisional ballot must be the same as the official ballot available in the
precinct on election day. A completed provisional ballot shall be sealed in a secrecy envelope. The
2748                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [59TH DAY

secrecy envelope shall be sealed inside the voter's provisional ballot envelope and deposited by the
voter in a secure, sealed provisional ballot box. Completed provisional ballots may not be combined
with other voted ballots in the polling place.
    (c) The form of the secrecy and provisional ballot envelopes shall be prescribed by the secretary
of state. The provisional ballot envelope must be a color other than that provided for absentee ballot
envelopes and must be prominently labeled "Provisional Ballot Envelope."
    (d) Provisional ballots and related documentation shall be delivered to and securely maintained
by the county auditor or municipal clerk in the same manner as required for other election materials
under sections 204C.27 to 204C.28.
    Subd. 2. Counting provisional ballots. (a) A voter who casts a provisional ballot in the polling
place may personally appear before the county auditor or municipal clerk no later than seven
calendar days following the election to prove that the voter's provisional ballot should be counted.
The county auditor or municipal clerk must count a provisional ballot in the final certified results
from the precinct if:
   (1) the statewide voter registration system indicates that the voter is eligible to vote or, if
challenged, the county auditor or municipal clerk does not, based upon available records and any
documentation presented by the voter, conclude that the voter is ineligible; and
    (2) the voter presents proof of identity and residence in the precinct in the manner permitted by
section 200.035.
    (b) If a voter does not appear before the county auditor or municipal clerk within seven calendar
days following the election or otherwise does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a), or if the
data listed on the items of identification presented by the voter does not match the data submitted
by the voter on the provisional ballot envelope, the voter's provisional ballot must not be counted.
    (c) The county auditor or municipal clerk must notify, in writing, any provisional voter who
does not appear within seven calendar days of the election that the voter's provisional ballot was not
counted because of the voter's failure to appear before the county auditor or municipal clerk within
the time permitted by law to determine whether the provisional ballot should be counted.
    Subd. 3. Provisional ballots; reconciliation. Prior to counting any provisional ballots in the final
vote totals from a precinct, the county auditor must verify that the number of signatures appearing on
the provisional ballot roster from that precinct is equal to the number of provisional ballots submitted
by voters in the precinct on election day. Any discrepancy must be resolved before the provisional
ballots from the precinct may be counted. Excess provisional ballots must be randomly withdrawn
in the manner required by section 204C.20, subdivision 2, after the period for a voter to appear to
prove residence and identity has expired and the ballots to be counted have been separated from the
provisional ballot envelopes.

   (b) vote more than once at the same election;
   (c) put a ballot in a ballot box for any illegal purpose;
    (d) give more than one ballot of the same kind and color to an election judge to be placed in a
ballot box;
   (e) aid, abet, counsel or procure another to go into any precinct for the purpose of voting in that
precinct, knowing that the other individual is not eligible to vote in that precinct; or

    A permanent system of voter registration by county is established, with a single, official,
centralized, interactive computerized statewide voter registration list defined, maintained, and
administered at the state level that contains the name and registration information of every legally
registered voter in the state, and assigns a unique identifier to each legally registered voter in the
state. The unique identifier shall be permanently assigned to the voter and may not be changed
or reassigned to another voter. The interactive computerized statewide voter registration list
constitutes the official list of every legally registered voter in the state. The county auditor shall be
chief registrar of voters and the chief custodian of the official registration records in each county.
The secretary of state is responsible for defining, maintaining, and administering the centralized
system.

    Subdivision 1. Establishment. The secretary of state shall maintain a statewide voter registration
system to facilitate voter registration and to provide a central database containing voter registration

secretary of state, or the Department of Public Safety;
    (2) provide for the definition, establishment, and maintenance of a central database for all voter
registration information;

voters under section 203B.16; and
    (15) provide reports on individuals who are not registered and reported to be ineligible to vote,

   The appropriate state or local official shall provide security measures to prevent unauthorized
access to the computerized list established under section 201.021.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 201.061, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Registration by election judges; procedures. Registration at the polling place on
election day shall be conducted by the election judges. Before registering an individual to vote
at the polling place, the election judge must review any list of absentee election day registrants
provided by the county auditor or municipal clerk to see if the person has already voted by absentee
ballot. If the person's name appears on the list, the election judge must not allow the individual to
register or to vote in the polling place. The election judges shall also review the list of individuals
reported to be ineligible to vote using the electronic roster, or a paper list provided by the county
auditor or municipal clerk. If an individual is on the challenged eligibility list maintained by the
secretary of state, the elections official shall comply with section 201.197. The election judge who
registers an individual at the polling place on election day shall not handle that voter's ballots at
any time prior to the opening of the ballot box after the voting ends. Registration applications and
forms for oaths shall be available at each polling place. If an individual who registers on election
day proves residence by oath of a registered voter, the form containing the oath shall be attached to
the individual's registration application. Registration applications completed on election day shall
be forwarded to the county auditor who shall add the name of each voter to the registration system
unless the information forwarded is substantially deficient. A county auditor who finds an election
day registration substantially deficient shall give written notice to the individual whose registration
is found deficient. An election day registration shall not be found deficient solely because the
individual who provided proof of residence was ineligible to do so.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 201.061, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Record of attempted registrations. The election judge responsible for election day

    A voter registration application accepted before January 1, 2004, is not deficient for lack of a
valid Minnesota driver's license or state identification number, voter identification card number, or
the last four digits of a Social Security number. A voter registration application submitted by a voter
who does not have a Minnesota driver's license or state identification number, voter identification
card number, or a Social Security number, is not deficient for lack of any of these numbers.
    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 201.081, is amended to read:
    201.081 REGISTRATION FILES.
    The statewide registration system is the official record of registered voters. The voter registration
applications and the terminal providing access to the statewide registration system must be under
the control of the county auditor or the public official to whom the county auditor has delegated
the responsibility for maintaining voter registration records. The voter registration applications and
terminals providing access to the statewide registration system must not be removed from the control
of the county auditor except as provided in this section. The county auditor may make photographic
copies of voter registration applications in the manner provided by section 138.17.
    A properly completed voter registration application that has been submitted to the secretary of
state or a county auditor must be maintained by the secretary of state or the county auditor for at
least 2
      ­2­ 36 months after the date that the information on the application is entered into the database
of the statewide registration system. The secretary of state or the county auditor may dispose of the
applications after retention for ­
                                 22­ 36 months in the manner provided by section 138.17.

soon as possible for review by the county auditor before final entry into the statewide registration
system. The secretary of state may mail the voter registration application to the county auditor.
    (c) Within ten days after the county auditor has entered information from a voter registration
application into the statewide registration system, the secretary of state shall compare the voter's
name, date of birth, and driver's license number, state identification number, voter identification card
number, or the last four digits of the Social Security number with the same information contained
in the Department of Public Safety database.
    (d) The secretary of state shall provide a report to the county auditor on a weekly basis that
includes a list of voters whose name, date of birth, or identification number have been compared
with the same information in the Department of Public Safety database and cannot be verified as
provided in this subdivision. The report must list separately those voters who have submitted a voter
registration application by mail and have not voted in a federal election in this state.
    (e) The county auditor shall compile a list of voters for whom the county auditor and the
secretary of state are unable to conclude that information on the voter registration application and
the corresponding information in the Department of Public Safety database relate to the same
person.
    (f) The county auditor shall send a notice of incomplete registration to any voter whose name
appears on the list and change the voter's status to "incomplete." A voter who receives a notice
of incomplete registration from the county auditor may either provide the information required to
complete the registration at least 21 days before the next election or at the polling place on election
day.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 201.121, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Postelection sampling. Within ten days after an election, the county auditor shall send
the notice required by subdivision 2 to a random sampling of the individuals registered on election
day. The random sampling shall be determined in accordance with the rules of the secretary of state.
As soon as practicable after the election, but no later than January 1 of the following year, the county
auditor shall mail the notice required by subdivision 2 to all other individuals registered on election
day. If a notice is returned as not deliverable, the county auditor shall attempt to determine the reason
for the return. A county auditor who does not receive or obtain satisfactory proof of an individual's
eligibility to vote shall immediately notify the county attorney of all of the relevant information
and the secretary of state of the numbers by precinct. By March 1 of every odd-numbered year,
the secretary of state shall report to the chair and ranking minority members of the legislative
committees with jurisdiction over elections the number of notices reported under this subdivision
to the secretary of state for the previous state general election by county and precinct.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 201.171, is amended to read:
  201.171 POSTING VOTING HISTORY; FAILURE TO VOTE; REGISTRATION
REMOVED.
    Within six weeks after every election, the county auditor shall post the voting history for
every person who voted in the election. After the close of the calendar year, the secretary of state
shall determine if any registrants have not voted during the preceding four years. The secretary
of state shall perform list maintenance by changing the status of those registrants to "inactive" in

the statewide registration system. The list maintenance performed must be conducted in a manner
that ensures that the name of each registered voter appears in the official list of eligible voters in
the statewide registration system. A voter must not be removed from the official list of eligible
voters unless the voter is not eligible or is not registered to vote. List maintenance must include
procedures for eliminating duplicate names from the official list of eligible voters.
     The secretary of state shall also prepare a report to the county auditor containing the names of

    Sec. 11. [201.197] CHALLENGED ELIGIBILITY LIST.
    (a) The secretary of state shall maintain an electronic database of individuals not registered and
who are reported to be ineligible to vote under section 201.014. The database may be maintained as
a module of the statewide voter registration system, if permitted by federal law, or maintained as a
separate database, and at a minimum must include an individual's name, address of residence, date
of birth, the reason the individual is reported to be ineligible to vote and, if available, the individual's
driver's license or state identification card number, voter identification card number, or the last four
digits of the individual's Social Security number. Entries in the database shall be compiled using
data submitted to the secretary of state under this chapter.
    (b) An elections official processing a voter registration application must verify whether the
individual listed on the application is included in the database of individuals reported to be ineligible
to vote. If the individual is listed in the database, the voter registration application may be accepted,
but the voter's status must be listed as "challenged." An election judge processing a voter registration
application submitted by a voter in a polling place on election day must verify the application using
the electronic roster, or if the polling place does not have an electronic roster, using a paper list
provided by the county auditor. A paper list used for verification in a polling place may be limited
to only those individuals reported to be residents of the county in which the precinct is located.
    Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 201.221, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Procedures for polling place rosters. The secretary of state shall prescribe the form
of polling place rosters that include the voter's name, address, date of birth, school district number,
and space for the voter's signature. The secretary of state may prescribe additional election-related
information to be placed on the polling place rosters on an experimental basis for one state primary
and general election cycle; the same information may not be placed on the polling place roster for a
second state primary and general election cycle unless specified in this subdivision. The polling place
roster must be used to indicate whether the voter has voted in a given election. The secretary of state
shall prescribe procedures for transporting the polling place rosters to the election judges for use on
election day. The secretary of state shall prescribe the form for a county or municipality to request
the date of birth from currently registered voters. The county or municipality shall not request the
date of birth from currently registered voters by any communication other than the prescribed form

and the form must clearly indicate that a currently registered voter does not lose registration status
by failing to provide the date of birth. In accordance with section 204B.40, the county auditor shall
retain the prescribed polling place rosters used on the date of election for ­
                                                                             2­2 36 months following
the election.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 203B.04, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Application procedures. (a) Except as otherwise allowed by subdivision 2 or by
section 203B.11, subdivision 4, an application for absentee ballots for any election may be submitted
at any time not less than one day before the day of that election. The county auditor shall prepare
absentee ballot application forms in the format provided by the secretary of state and shall furnish
them to any person on request. By January 1 of each even-numbered year, the secretary of state shall
make the forms to be used available to auditors through electronic means. An application submitted
pursuant to this subdivision shall be in writing and shall be submitted to:
   (1) the county auditor of the county where the applicant maintains residence; or
   (2) the municipal clerk of the municipality, or school district if applicable, where the applicant
maintains residence.
   (b) An application shall be approved if it is timely received, signed and dated by the applicant,
and contains:
   (1) the applicant's name and residence and mailing addresses,

paragraph.
   (d) Except as otherwise provided by this section, all provisions of the Minnesota Election Law

may, for the purpose of monitoring and evaluating election procedures: (1) open the sealed ballot
envelopes and inspect the ballots for that election maintained by the county auditors, municipal
clerks, or school district clerks; (2) inspect the polling place rosters and completed voter registration
applications; or (3) examine other forms required in the Minnesota election laws for use in the
polling place. No inspected ballot or document may be marked or identified in any manner. After
inspection, all ballots must be returned to the ballot envelope and the ballot envelope must be
securely resealed. Any other election materials inspected or examined must be secured or resealed.

with the number of ballots to be counted.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 204C.20, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Excess ballots. If two or more ballots are found folded together like a single ballot, the
election judges shall lay them aside until all the ballots in the box have been counted. If it is evident
from the number of ballots to be counted that the ballots folded together were cast by one voter,
the election judges shall preserve but not count them. If the number of ballots in one box exceeds
the number to be counted, the election judges shall examine all the ballots in the box to ascertain
that all are properly marked with the initials of the election judges. If any ballots are not properly
marked with the initials of the election judges, the election judges shall preserve but not count them;
however, if the number of ballots does not exceed the number to be counted, the absence of either or
both sets of initials of the election judges does not, by itself, disqualify the vote from being counted

voter's intent shall be marked on the back "Defective" if it is totally defective or "Defective as to
......," naming the office or question if it is defective only in part. Defective ballots must be placed
in an envelope designated for defective ballots from the precinct, sealed, and returned as required

     Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 209.021, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Manner; time; contents. Service of a notice of contest must be made in the
same manner as the service of summons in civil actions. The notice of contest must specify the
grounds on which the contest will be made. The contestant shall serve notice of the contest on the
parties enumerated in this section. Notice must be served and filed within five days after the canvass
is completed in the case of a primary or special primary or within seven days after the canvass is
completed in the case of a special or general election; except that:
     (1) if a contest is based on a deliberate, serious, and material violation of the election laws which
was discovered from the statements of receipts and disbursements required to be filed by candidates
and committees, the action may be commenced and the notice served and filed within ten days after
the filing of the statements in the case of a general or special election or within five days after the
filing of the statements in the case of a primary or special primary.    ­;
    (2) if a notice of contest questions only which party received the highest number of votes legally
cast at the election, a contestee who loses may serve and file a notice of contest on any other ground
during the three days following expiration of the time for appealing the decision on the vote count;
and
     (3) if data or documents necessary to determine grounds for a contest, including but not limited
to lists of the names of every voter who participated in an election, are not available to a candidate
or the general public prior to the close of the period for filing a notice of contest under this section
due to nonfeasance, malfeasance, or failure to perform duties within the time required by statute
on the part of the secretary of state, a county auditor, or other state, county, or municipal election
official, a notice of contest may be served and filed within seven days after the data or documents
become available for inspection by the candidates and the general public.
     Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 209.06, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Appointment of inspectors. After a contest has been instituted, either party may

envelopes, applications for absentee ballots, precinct summary statements, printouts from voting
machines, and precinct incident logs, inspected before preparing for trial. The party requesting an
inspection shall file with the district court where the contest is brought a verified petition, stating that
the case cannot properly be prepared for trial without an inspection of the ballots and other election
materials and designating the precincts in which an inspection is desired. A judge of the court in
which the contest is pending shall then appoint as many sets of three inspectors for a contest of any
office or question as are needed to count and inspect the ballots expeditiously. One inspector must
be selected by each of the parties to the contest and a third must be chosen by those two inspectors.
If either party neglects or refuses to name an inspector, the judge shall appoint the inspector. The
compensation of inspectors is the same as for referees, unless otherwise stipulated.
   Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 211B.11, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Soliciting near polling places. A person may not display campaign material, post
signs, ask, solicit, or in any manner try to induce or persuade a voter within a polling place or within
100 feet of the building in which a polling place is situated, or anywhere on the public property on
which a polling place is situated, on primary or election day to vote for or refrain from voting for a
candidate or ballot question. A person may not provide political badges, political buttons, or other
political insignia to be worn at or about the polling place on the day of a primary or election. A
political badge, political button, or other political insignia may not be worn at or about the polling
place on primary or election day if it is designed to influence voting for or against a particular
candidate, political party, or question on the ballot at the election. This section applies to areas
established by the county auditor or municipal clerk for absentee voting as provided in chapter
203B.
    The secretary of state, county auditor, municipal clerk, or school district clerk may provide
stickers which contain the words "I VOTED" and nothing more. Election judges may offer a sticker
of this type to each voter who has signed the polling place roster or a voter's receipt.
   Sec. 29. PROPOSED LEGISLATION.
    By January 15, 2012, the secretary of state must report to the chairs and ranking minority
members of the legislative committees responsible for elections proposed legislation to amend
matters currently contained in administrative rules as necessary to implement or make specific
this act. To the greatest extent practical, this proposed legislation must propose codifying into law
matters that otherwise would be enacted through the administrative rulemaking process.
    To the extent that codifying matters into law is not practical, the proposed legislation must direct,
by law, specific changes to be made in administrative rules so that no interpretation of the law by the
secretary of state would be necessary, and use of the good cause rulemaking exemption in Minnesota
Statutes, section 14.388 would be appropriate if the legislature authorizes use of this process.
   Sec. 30. REPEALER.
   Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 203B.04, subdivision 3, is repealed.
                                              ARTICLE 3

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 200.02, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
59TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2011                                          2765

    Subd. 12a. Polling place roster. "Polling place roster" means the official lists used to record a
voter's appearance in a polling place on election day, including the list of registered voters in the
precinct, and the list of voters registering on election day. A polling place roster may be in a printed
or electronic format, as permitted by section 201.225.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 201.221, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Procedures for polling place rosters. The secretary of state shall prescribe the form
of polling place rosters that include the voter's name, address, date of birth, school district number,
and space for the voter's signature. A polling place roster provided in an electronic form must allow
for a printed voter's receipt that meets the standards provided in section 201.225, subdivision 2.
The secretary of state may prescribe additional election-related information to be placed on the
polling place rosters on an experimental basis for one state primary and general election cycle; the
same information may not be placed on the polling place roster for a second state primary and
general election cycle unless specified in this subdivision. The polling place roster must be used
to indicate whether the voter has voted in a given election. The secretary of state shall prescribe
procedures for transporting the polling place rosters to the election judges for use on election day.
The secretary of state shall prescribe the form for a county or municipality to request the date of birth
from currently registered voters. The county or municipality shall not request the date of birth from
currently registered voters by any communication other than the prescribed form and the form must
clearly indicate that a currently registered voter does not lose registration status by failing to provide
the date of birth. In accordance with section 204B.40, the county auditor shall retain the prescribed
polling place rosters used on the date of election for 2­2
                                                         ­ 36 months following the election.
   Sec. 3. [201.225] ELECTRONIC ROSTER; STANDARDS.
   Subdivision 1. Certification of system. (a) A precinct may have a secure network of two or
more computer systems to serve as the precinct's electronic polling place roster.
    (b) Precincts may not use an electronic roster until the secretary of state has certified that the
system design and operational procedures are sufficient to prevent any voter from voting more than
once at an election, and to prevent access to the system by unauthorized individuals.
   Subd. 2. Minimum standards for electronic rosters. At a minimum, an electronic roster must:
    (1) be preloaded with data from the statewide voter registration system, including data on
individuals reported to be ineligible to vote;
    (2) permit all voting information processed by any computer in a precinct to be immediately
accessible to all other computers in the precinct and to be transferred to the statewide voter
registration system on election night or no later than one week after the election;
    (3) provide for a printed voter's receipt, containing the voter's name, address of residence, date of
birth, voter identification number as assigned by the secretary of state, the oath required by section
204C.10, and a space for the voter's original signature;
    (4) immediately alert the election judge if the electronic roster indicates that a voter has already
voted at the election, is ineligible to vote, does not reside in the precinct, or the voter's registration
status is challenged;
   (5) automatically accept and input data from a scanned Minnesota driver's license, identification
2766                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [59TH DAY

card, or voter identification card and match the data to an existing voter registration record, and
permit manual input of voter data, if necessary; and
    (6) perform any other functions required for the efficient and secure administration of an election,
as required by law.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 204B.14, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Separate precincts; combined polling place. (a) The following shall constitute at least
one election precinct:
   (1) each city ward; and
   (2) each town and each statutory city.
   (b) A single, accessible, combined polling place may be established no later than May 1 of any
year:
   (1) for any city of the third or fourth class, any town, or any city having territory in more than
one county, in which all the voters of the city or town shall cast their ballots;
   (2) for two contiguous precincts in the same municipality that have a combined total of fewer
than 500 registered voters;
    (3) for up to four contiguous municipalities located entirely outside the metropolitan area, as
defined by section 200.02, subdivision 24, that are contained in the same county; or
   (4) for noncontiguous precincts located in one or more counties.
    A copy of the ordinance or resolution establishing a combined polling place must be filed with
the county auditor within 30 days after approval by the governing body. A polling place combined
under clause (3) must be approved by the governing body of each participating municipality.
A polling place combined under clause (4) must be approved by the governing body of each
participating municipality and the secretary of state and may be located outside any of the
noncontiguous precincts. A municipality withdrawing from participation in a combined polling
place must do so by filing a resolution of withdrawal with the county auditor no later than April 1
of any year.
    The secretary of state shall provide a separate polling place roster for each precinct served by the
combined polling place unless that precinct uses an electronic roster. A single set of election judges
may be appointed to serve at a combined polling place. The number of election judges required
must be based on the total number of persons voting at the last similar election in all precincts to be
voting at the combined polling place. Separate ballot boxes must be provided for the ballots from
each precinct. The results of the election must be reported separately for each precinct served by
the combined polling place, except in a polling place established under clause (2) where one of the
precincts has fewer than ten registered voters, in which case the results of that precinct must be
reported in the manner specified by the secretary of state.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 204C.12, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
  Subd. 4. Refusal to answer questions or sign a polling place roster. A challenged individual

   (a) The official who has custody of the voted ballots is responsible for keeping secure all election
materials. Registration cards of voters who registered on election day may be processed as required
by rule. All other election materials must be kept secure by precinct as returned by the election
judges until all recounts have been completed and until the time for contest of election has expired.
    (b) Any candidate for an office to be recounted may have all materials relating to the election,
including, but not limited to, polling place rosters, voter registration applications, accepted absentee
ballot envelopes, rejected absentee ballot envelopes, applications for absentee ballots, precinct
summary statements, printouts from voting machines, and precinct incident logs inspected before
the canvassing board may certify the results of the recount.
   Sec. 9. [204E.08] FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT.
    All recounts must be accessible to the public. In a multicounty recount the secretary of state
may locate the recount in one or more of the election jurisdictions or at the site of the canvassing
board. Each election jurisdiction where a recount is conducted shall make available, without charge
to the recount official or body conducting the recount, adequate accessible space and all necessary
equipment and facilities.
   Sec. 10. [204E.09] GENERAL PROCEDURES.
    At the opening of a recount, the recount official or legal adviser shall present the procedures
contained in this section for the recount. The custodian of the ballots shall make available to the
recount official the precinct summary statements, the precinct boxes or the sealed containers of voted
ballots, and any other election materials requested by the recount official. If the recount official needs
to leave the room for any reason, the recount official must designate a deputy recount official to
preside during the recount official's absence. A recount official must be in the room at all times. The
containers of voted ballots must be unsealed and resealed within public view. No ballots or election
materials may be handled by candidates, their representatives, or members of the public. There must
be an area of the room from which the public may observe the recount. Cell phones and video
cameras may be used in this public viewing area, as long as their use is not disruptive. The recount
official shall arrange the counting of the ballots so that the candidates and their representatives may
observe the ballots as they are recounted. Candidates may each have one representative observe the
sorting of each precinct. One additional representative per candidate may observe the ballots when
they have been sorted and are being counted pursuant to section 204E.10. Candidates may have
additional representatives in the public viewing area of the room. If other election materials are
handled or examined by the recount officials, the candidates and their representatives may observe
them. The recount official shall ensure that public observation does not interfere with the counting
of the ballots. The recount official shall prepare a summary of the recount vote by precinct.
   Sec. 11. [204E.10] COUNTING AND CHALLENGING BALLOTS.
    Subdivision 1. Breaks in counting process. Recount officials may not take a break for a meal or
for the day prior to the completion of the sorting, counting, review, and labeling of challenges, and
secure storage of the ballots for any precinct. All challenged ballots must be stored securely during
breaks in the counting process.
    Subd. 2. Sorting ballots. Ballots must be recounted by precinct. The recount official shall open
the sealed container of ballots and recount them in accordance with section 204C.22. The recount
official must review each ballot and sort the ballots into piles based upon the recount official's
2778                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [59TH DAY

determination as to which candidate, if any, the voter intended to vote for: one pile for each candidate
that is the subject of the recount and one pile for all other ballots.
    Subd. 3. Challenge. During the sorting, a candidate or candidate's representative may challenge
the ballot if the candidate's representative disagrees with the recount official's determination of the
person for whom the ballot should be counted and whether there are identifying marks on the ballot.
At a recount of a ballot question, the manner in which a ballot is counted may be challenged by the
person who requested the recount or that person's representative. Challenges may not be automatic
or frivolous and the challenger must state the basis for the challenge pursuant to section 204C.22.
Challenged ballots must be placed into separate piles, one for ballots challenged by each candidate.
Only the canvassing board with responsibility to certify the results of the recount has the authority
to declare a challenge to be "frivolous."
    Subd. 4. Counting ballots. Once ballots have been sorted, the recount officials must count

made. The precinct name, the reason for the challenge, and the name of the person challenging the
ballot or the candidate that person represents, and a sequential number must be marked on the back
of each remaining challenged ballot before it is placed in an envelope marked "Challenged Ballots."
After the count of votes for the precinct has been determined, all ballots except the challenged
ballots must be resealed in the ballot envelopes and returned with the other election materials to
the custodian of the ballots. The recount official may make copies of the challenged ballots. After
the count of votes for all precincts has been determined during that day of counting, the challenged
ballot envelope must be sealed and kept secure for presentation to the canvassing board.

representative who made the challenge may present the basis for the challenge to the canvassing
board. The canvassing board shall rule on the challenged ballots and incorporate the results into the
summary statement. The canvassing board shall certify the results of the recount. Challenged ballots
must be returned to the election official who has custody of the ballots.
   Subd. 2. Tie votes. In case of a tie vote for nomination or election to an office, the canvassing
board with the responsibility for declaring the results for that office shall determine the tie by lot.

    When a bond, cash, or surety for recount expenses is required by section 204E.04 or 204E.05,
the governing body or recount official shall set the amount of the security deposit at an amount
which will cover expected recount expenses. In multicounty districts, the secretary of state shall

one; or unless the court finds the remaining valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and are
incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.
