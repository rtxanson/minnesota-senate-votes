within 15 days after the certification hearing was completed, unless additional time is needed, in
which case the court may extend the period up to another 15 days. If the juvenile court orders
certification, and the presumption described in subdivision 3 does not apply, the order shall contain
in writing, findings of fact and conclusions of law as to why public safety is not served by retaining
the proceeding in the juvenile court. A child certified under this paragraph may be detained pending

    (b) If the juvenile court, after a hearing conducted pursuant to subdivision 2, decides not to
order certification, the decision shall contain, in writing, findings of fact and conclusions of law as
to why certification is not ordered. If the juvenile court decides not to order certification in a case in
which the presumption described in subdivision 3 applies, the court shall designate the proceeding
an extended jurisdiction juvenile prosecution and include in its decision written findings of fact
and conclusions of law as to why the retention of the proceeding in juvenile court serves public
safety, with specific reference to the factors listed in subdivision 4. If the court decides not to order

medical condition as to necessitate the abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or to avert serious
risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, not including
psychological or emotional conditions.
   Sec. 4. [145.4141] DEFINITIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Scope. For purposes of sections 145.4141 to 145.4148, the following terms have
the meanings given them.
    Subd. 2. Abortion. "Abortion" means the use or prescription of any instrument, medicine, drug,
or any other substance or device to terminate the pregnancy of a woman known to be pregnant, with
an intention other than to increase the probability of a live birth; to preserve the life or health of
the child after live birth; or to remove a dead unborn child who died as the result of natural causes
in utero, accidental trauma, or a criminal assault on the pregnant woman or her unborn child; and
which causes the premature termination of the pregnancy.
    Subd. 3. Attempt to perform or induce an abortion. "Attempt to perform or induce an
abortion" means an act, or an omission of a statutorily required act, that, under the circumstances
as the actor believes them to be, constitutes a substantial step in a course of conduct planned
to culminate in the performance or induction of an abortion in this state in violation of sections
145.4141 to 145.4148.
   Subd. 4. Fertilization. "Fertilization" means the fusion of a human spermatozoon with a human
ovum.
    Subd. 5. Medical emergency. "Medical emergency" means a condition that, in reasonable
medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of the pregnant woman that it necessitates
the immediate abortion of her pregnancy without first determining postfertilization age to avert
her death or for which the delay necessary to determine postfertilization age will create serious
risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function not including
psychological or emotional conditions. No condition shall be deemed a medical emergency if
61ST DAY]                             FRIDAY, MAY 20, 2011                                         2975

based on a claim or diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct which she intends to result in
her death or in substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.
    Subd. 6. Physician. "Physician" means any person licensed to practice medicine and surgery or
osteopathic medicine and surgery in this state.
    Subd. 7. Postfertilization age. "Postfertilization age" means the age of the unborn child as
calculated from the fusion of a human spermatozoon with a human ovum.
    Subd. 8. Probable postfertilization age of the unborn child. "Probable postfertilization age of
the unborn child" means what, in reasonable medical judgment, will with reasonable probability be
the postfertilization age of the unborn child at the time the abortion is planned to be performed or
induced.
   Subd. 9. Reasonable medical judgment. "Reasonable medical judgment" means a medical
judgment that would be made by a reasonably prudent physician knowledgeable about the case
and the treatment possibilities with respect to the medical conditions involved.
    Subd. 10. Unborn child or fetus. "Unborn child" or "fetus" means an individual organism of
the species homo sapiens from fertilization until live birth.
   Subd. 11. Woman. "Woman" means a female human being whether or not she has reached the
age of majority.
   Sec. 5. [145.4142] LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   (a) The legislature makes the following findings.
    (b) Pain receptors (nociceptors) are present throughout an unborn child's entire body and nerves
link these receptors to the brain's thalamus and subcortical plate by 20 weeks.
    (c) By eight weeks after fertilization, an unborn child reacts to touch. After 20 weeks an unborn
child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human, for example
by recoiling.
    (d) In the unborn child, application of such painful stimuli is associated with significant increases
in stress hormones known as the stress response.
    (e) Subjection to such painful stimuli is associated with long-term harmful neurodevelopmental
effects, such as altered pain sensitivity and, possibly, emotional, behavioral, and learning disabilities
later in life.
   (f) For the purposes of surgery on an unborn child, fetal anesthesia is routinely administered
and is associated with a decrease in stress hormones compared to the level when painful stimuli is
applied without anesthesia.
    (g) The position, asserted by some medical experts, that an unborn child is incapable of
experiencing pain until a point later in pregnancy than 20 weeks after fertilization predominately
rests on the assumption that the ability to experience pain depends on the cerebral cortex and
requires nerve connections between the thalamus and the cortex. However, recent medical research
and analysis, especially since 2007, provides strong evidence for the conclusion that a functioning
cortex is not necessary to experience pain.
2976                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [61ST DAY

   (h) Substantial evidence indicates that children born missing the bulk of the cerebral cortex,
those with hydranencephaly, nevertheless experience pain.
    (i) In adults, stimulation or ablation of the cerebral cortex does not alter pain perception, while
stimulation or ablation of the thalamus does.
    (j) Substantial evidence indicates that structures used for pain processing in early development
differ from those of adults, using different neural elements available at specific times during
development, such as the subcortical plate, to fulfill the role of pain processing.
    (k) The position asserted by some medical experts, that the unborn child remains in a coma-like
sleep state that precludes the unborn child experiencing pain is inconsistent with the documented
reaction of unborn children to painful stimuli and with the experience of fetal surgeons who have
found it necessary to sedate the unborn child with anesthesia to prevent the unborn child from
thrashing about in reaction to invasive surgery.
   (l) Consequently, there is substantial medical evidence that an unborn child is capable of
experiencing pain by 20 weeks after fertilization.
    (m) It is the purpose of the state to assert a compelling state interest in protecting the lives of
unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates that they are capable
of feeling pain.
   Sec. 6. [145.4143] DETERMINATION OF POSTFERTILIZATION AGE.
   Subdivision 1. Determination of postfertilization age. Except in the case of a medical
emergency, no abortion shall be performed or induced or be attempted to be performed or induced
unless the physician performing or inducing it has first made a determination of the probable
postfertilization age of the unborn child or relied upon such a determination made by another
physician. In making such a determination, the physician shall make those inquiries of the woman
and perform or cause to be performed those medical examinations and tests that a reasonably
prudent physician, knowledgeable about the case and the medical conditions involved, would
consider necessary to perform in making an accurate diagnosis with respect to postfertilization age.
    Subd. 2. Unprofessional conduct. Failure by any physician to conform to any requirement of
this section constitutes unprofessional conduct under section 147.091, paragraph (k).
  Sec. 7. [145.4144] ABORTION OF UNBORN CHILD OF 20 OR MORE WEEKS
POSTFERTILIZATION AGE PROHIBITED; CAPABLE OF FEELING PAIN.
    Subdivision 1. Abortion prohibition; exemption. No person shall perform or induce or attempt
to perform or induce an abortion upon a woman when it has been determined, by the physician
performing or inducing or attempting to perform or induce the abortion, or by another physician upon
whose determination that physician relies, that the probable postfertilization age of the woman's
unborn child is 20 or more weeks unless, in reasonable medical judgment, she has a condition which
so complicates her medical condition as to necessitate the abortion of her pregnancy to avert her
death or to avert serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily
function, not including psychological or emotional conditions. No such condition shall be deemed to
exist if it is based on a claim or diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct which she intends to
result in her death or in substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.
61ST DAY]                             FRIDAY, MAY 20, 2011                                        2977

    Subd. 2. When abortion not prohibited. When an abortion upon a woman whose unborn child
has been determined to have a probable postfertilization age of 20 or more weeks is not prohibited
by this section, the physician shall terminate the pregnancy in the manner which, in reasonable
medical judgment, provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive unless, in reasonable
medical judgment, termination of the pregnancy in that manner would pose a greater risk either
of the death of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of
a major bodily function, not including psychological or emotional conditions, of the woman than
would other available methods. No such greater risk shall be deemed to exist if it is based on a claim
or diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct which she intends to result in her death or in
substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.
   Sec. 8. [145.4145] ENFORCEMENT.
    Subdivision 1. Criminal penalties. A person who intentionally or recklessly performs or induces
or attempts to perform or induce an abortion in violation of sections 145.4141 to 145.4148 shall
be guilty of a felony. No penalty may be assessed against the woman upon whom the abortion is
performed or induced or attempted to be performed or induced.
    Subd. 2. Civil remedies. (a) A woman upon whom an abortion has been performed or induced in
violation of sections 145.4141 to 145.4148, or the father of the unborn child who was the subject of
such an abortion, may maintain an action against the person who performed or induced the abortion
in intentional or reckless violation of sections 145.4141 to 145.4148 for damages. A woman upon
whom an abortion has been attempted in violation of sections 145.4141 to 145.4148 may maintain
an action against the person who attempted to perform or induce the abortion in an intentional or
reckless violation of sections 145.4141 to 145.4148 for damages.
    (b) A cause of action for injunctive relief against a person who has intentionally violated sections
145.4141 to 145.4148 may be maintained by the woman upon whom an abortion was performed or
induced or attempted to be performed or induced in violation of sections 145.4141 to 145.4148; by
a person who is the father of the unborn child subject to an abortion, parent, sibling, or guardian of,
or a current or former licensed health care provider of, the woman upon whom an abortion has been
performed or induced or attempted to be performed or induced in violation of sections 145.4141
to 145.4148; by a county attorney with appropriate jurisdiction; or by the attorney general. The
injunction shall prevent the abortion provider from performing or inducing or attempting to perform
or induce further abortions in this state in violation of sections 145.4141 to 145.4148.
   (c) If judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiff in an action described in this section, the
court shall also render judgment for reasonable attorney fees in favor of the plaintiff against the
defendant.
    (d) If judgment is rendered in favor of the defendant and the court finds that the plaintiff's suit
was frivolous and brought in bad faith, the court shall also render judgment for reasonable attorney
fees in favor of the defendant against the plaintiff.
     (e) No damages or attorney fees may be assessed against the woman upon whom an abortion
was performed or induced or attempted to be performed or induced except according to paragraph
(d).
   Sec. 9. [145.4146] PROTECTION OF PRIVACY IN COURT PROCEEDINGS.
2978                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [61ST DAY

    In every civil or criminal proceeding or action brought under the Pain-Capable Unborn Child
Protection Act, the court shall rule on whether the anonymity of a woman upon whom an abortion
has been performed or induced or attempted to be performed or induced shall be preserved from
public disclosure if she does not give her consent to such disclosure. The court, upon motion or sua
sponte, shall make such a ruling and, upon determining that her anonymity should be preserved,
shall issue orders to the parties, witnesses, and counsel and shall direct the sealing of the record and
exclusion of individuals from courtrooms or hearing rooms to the extent necessary to safeguard her
identity from public disclosure. Each such order shall be accompanied by specific written findings
explaining why the anonymity of the woman should be preserved from public disclosure, why the
order is essential to that end, how the order is narrowly tailored to serve that interest, and why no
reasonable, less restrictive alternative exists. In the absence of written consent of the woman upon
whom an abortion has been performed or induced or attempted to be performed or induced, anyone,
other than a public official, who brings an action under section 145.4145, subdivision 2, shall do so
under a pseudonym. This section may not be construed to conceal the identity of the plaintiff or of
witnesses from the defendant or from attorneys for the defendant.
   Sec. 10. [145.4147] SEVERABILITY.
    If any one or more provisions, sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, phrases, or words
of sections 145.4141 to 145.4148, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is
found to be unconstitutional, the same is hereby declared to be severable and the balance of
sections 145.4141 to 145.4148 shall remain effective notwithstanding such unconstitutionality.
The legislature hereby declares that it would have passed sections 145.4141 to 145.4148, and each
provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word thereof, irrespective of the fact
that any one or more provisions, sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, phrases, or words of
sections 145.4141 to 145.4148, or the application of sections 145.4141 to 145.4148, would be
declared unconstitutional."

    (b) The subcommittee must use the criteria in clauses (1) to (9) as well as other criteria it
determines appropriate in carrying out the review and ranking:
   (1) whether the proposed activities are identified in a comprehensive water management plan or
other appropriate local planning documents as priorities;
   (2) the potential that the proposed activities have for improving or protecting environmental
quality;
   (3) the extent that the proposed activities support areawide or multijurisdictional approaches to
protecting environmental quality based on defined watershed or similar geographic areas;
    (4) whether the activities are needed for compliance with existing environmental laws or rules;
   (5) whether the proposed activities demonstrate participation, coordination, and cooperation
between local units of government and other public agencies;
    (6) whether there is coordination with other public and private funding sources and programs;
   (7) whether the applicant has targeted specific best management practices to resolve specific
environmental problems;
    (8) past performance of the applicant in completing projects identified in prior applications and
allocation agreements; and
    (9) whether there are off-site public benefits.

fishing equipment used in Lake Superior.
    (b) All nets, traps, buoys, anchors, stakes, and lines used for commercial fishing or turtle, frog, or
crayfish harvesting in an infested water that is designated solely because it contains Eurasian water
milfoil must be dried for a minimum of ten days or frozen for a minimum of two days before they
are used in any other waters, except as provided in this paragraph. Commercial licensees must notify
the department's regional or area fisheries office or a conservation officer before removing nets or
equipment from an infested water designated solely because it contains Eurasian water milfoil and
before resetting those nets or equipment in any other waters. Upon notification, the commissioner
may authorize a commercial licensee to move nets or equipment to another water without freezing
or drying, if that water is designated as infested solely because it contains Eurasian water milfoil.
   (c) A commercial licensee must remove all aquatic macrophytes from nets and other equipment
when the nets and equipment are removed from waters of the state.
    (d) The commissioner shall provide a commercial licensee with a current listing of designated
infested waters at the time that a license or permit is issued.
    (e) A person harvesting aquatic life from waters of the state for the purpose of transporting and
stocking shall transport the aquatic life to a holding facility. The aquatic life shall remain in the
holding facility for at least ten hours and be examined for the presence of invasive species.
     (f) This subdivision applies to the state and its departments and agencies.

location in the state, or a private location where the watercraft or water-related equipment is in
plain view, if the officer determines there is reason to believe that aquatic invasive species, aquatic
macrophytes, or water is present on the watercraft or water-related equipment.
    (d) Conservation officers or other licensed peace officers may utilize check stations in locations,
or in proximity to locations, where watercraft or other water-related equipment is placed into or

necessary to avoid spreading aquatic invasive species.
   (b) Before receiving a permit, or working for a permittee, a person annually must satisfactorily
complete aquatic invasive species-related training provided by the commissioner.

for timber production. Every such lease or permit shall be revocable at the discretion of the
commissioner at any time subject to such conditions as may be agreed on in the lease. The approval
of the commissioner of administration shall not be required upon any such lease or permit. No
such lease or permit for a period exceeding 21 years shall be granted except with the approval of
the Executive Council.

under state management.
   (c) Notwithstanding section 16A.125, subdivision 5, after deducting the reasonable costs
incurred for preparing and issuing the lease, all remaining proceeds from the leasing of school trust
land and university land for roads on forest lands must be deposited into the respective permanent
fund for the lands.

    Subd. 2. Violation is separate offense. Violation of this section is a separate and independent
offense from other violations of sections 103G.2212 to 103G.237.
    Subd. 3. Form for compliance with this section. The board shall develop a form to be
distributed to contractors' associations, local government units, and soil and water conservation
districts to comply with this section. The form must include:
   (1) a listing of the activities for which a replacement plan is required;
   (2) a description of the penalties for violating sections 103G.2212 to 103G.237;
   (3) the telephone number to call for information on the responsible local government unit;
   (4) a statement that national wetland inventory maps are on file with the soil and water
conservation district office; and
    (5) spaces for a description of the work and the names, mailing addresses or other contact
information, and telephone numbers of the person authorizing the work and the agent or employee
proposing to undertake it.
   Sec. 66. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103G.222, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Requirements. (a) Wetlands must not be drained or filled, wholly or partially,
unless replaced by restoring or creating wetland areas of at least equal public value under
a replacement plan approved as provided in section 103G.2242, a replacement plan under a
local governmental unit's comprehensive wetland protection and management plan approved by
the board under section 103G.2243, or, if a permit to mine is required under section 93.481,
under a mining reclamation plan approved by the commissioner under the permit to mine. For
project-specific wetland replacement completed prior to wetland impacts authorized or conducted
under a permit to mine within the Great Lakes and Rainy River watershed basins, those basins
shall be considered a single watershed for purposes of determining wetland replacement ratios.
Mining reclamation plans shall apply the same principles and standards for replacing wetlands by
restoration or creation of wetland areas that are applicable to mitigation plans approved as provided
in section 103G.2242. Public value must be determined in accordance with section 103B.3355 or
a comprehensive wetland protection and management plan established under section 103G.2243.
Sections 103G.221 to 103G.2372 also apply to excavation in permanently and semipermanently
flooded areas of types 3, 4, and 5 wetlands.
   (b) Replacement must be guided by the following principles in descending order of priority:
   (1) avoiding the direct or indirect impact of the activity that may destroy or diminish the wetland;
   (2) minimizing the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the wetland activity and its
implementation;
   (3) rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected wetland
environment;
   (4) reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations
during the life of the activity;
   (5) compensating for the impact by restoring a wetland; and
61ST DAY]                             FRIDAY, MAY 20, 2011                                        3005

   (6) compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute wetland resources or
environments.
    For a project involving the draining or filling of wetlands in an amount not exceeding 10,000
square feet more than the applicable amount in section 103G.2241, subdivision 9, paragraph (a), the
local government unit may make an on-site sequencing determination without a written alternatives
analysis from the applicant.
    (c) If a wetland is located in a cultivated field, then replacement must be accomplished through
restoration only without regard to the priority order in paragraph (b), provided that a deed restriction
is placed on the altered wetland prohibiting nonagricultural use for at least ten years.
    (d) If a wetland is drained under section 103G.2241, subdivision 2, paragraphs (b) and (e),
the local government unit may require a deed restriction that prohibits nonagricultural use for at
least ten years unless the drained wetland is replaced as provided under this section. The local
government unit may require the deed restriction if it determines the wetland area drained is at risk
of conversion to a nonagricultural use within ten years based on the zoning classification, proximity
to a municipality or full service road, or other criteria as determined by the local government unit.
   (e) Restoration and replacement of wetlands must be accomplished in accordance with the
ecology of the landscape area affected and ponds that are created primarily to fulfill storm water
management, and water quality treatment requirements may not be used to satisfy replacement
requirements under this chapter unless the design includes pretreatment of runoff and the pond is
functioning as a wetland.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraph (g), for a wetland or public waters wetland located on
nonagricultural land, replacement must be in the ratio of two acres of replaced wetland for each
acre of drained or filled wetland.
    (g) For a wetland or public waters wetland located on agricultural land or in a greater than 80
percent area, replacement must be in the ratio of one acre of replaced wetland for each acre of
drained or filled wetland.
    (h) Wetlands that are restored or created as a result of an approved replacement plan are subject
to the provisions of this section for any subsequent drainage or filling.
    (i) Except in a greater than 80 percent area, only wetlands that have been restored from
previously drained or filled wetlands, wetlands created by excavation in nonwetlands, wetlands
created by dikes or dams along public or private drainage ditches, or wetlands created by dikes
or dams associated with the restoration of previously drained or filled wetlands may be used in a
statewide banking program established in rules adopted under section 103G.2242, subdivision 1.
Modification or conversion of nondegraded naturally occurring wetlands from one type to another
are not eligible for enrollment in a statewide wetlands bank.
    (j) The Technical Evaluation Panel established under section 103G.2242, subdivision 2,
shall ensure that sufficient time has occurred for the wetland to develop wetland characteristics
of soils, vegetation, and hydrology before recommending that the wetland be deposited in the
statewide wetland bank. If the Technical Evaluation Panel has reason to believe that the wetland
characteristics may change substantially, the panel shall postpone its recommendation until the
wetland has stabilized.

    (k) This section and sections 103G.223 to 103G.2242, 103G.2364, and 103G.2365 apply to the
state and its departments and agencies.
    (l) For projects involving draining or filling of wetlands associated with a new public
transportation project, and for projects expanded solely for additional traffic capacity, public
transportation authorities may purchase credits from the board at the cost to the board to establish
credits. Proceeds from the sale of credits provided under this paragraph are appropriated to the
board for the purposes of this paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, "transportation
project" does not include an airport project.
     (m) A replacement plan for wetlands is not required for individual projects that result in the
filling or draining of wetlands for the repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or replacement of a
currently serviceable existing state, city, county, or town public road necessary, as determined by the
public transportation authority, to meet state or federal design or safety standards or requirements,
excluding new roads or roads expanded solely for additional traffic capacity lanes. This paragraph
only applies to authorities for public transportation projects that:
   (1) minimize the amount of wetland filling or draining associated with the project and consider
mitigating important site-specific wetland functions on site;
     (2) except as provided in clause (3), submit project-specific reports to the board, the Technical
Evaluation Panel, the commissioner of natural resources, and members of the public requesting a
copy at least 30 days prior to construction that indicate the location, amount, and type of wetlands to
be filled or drained by the project or, alternatively, convene an annual meeting of the parties required
to receive notice to review projects to be commenced during the upcoming year; and
    (3) for minor and emergency maintenance work impacting less than 10,000 square feet, submit
project-specific reports, within 30 days of commencing the activity, to the board that indicate the
location, amount, and type of wetlands that have been filled or drained.
    Those required to receive notice of public transportation projects may appeal minimization,
delineation, and on-site mitigation decisions made by the public transportation authority to the board
according to the provisions of section 103G.2242, subdivision 9. The Technical Evaluation Panel
shall review minimization and delineation decisions made by the public transportation authority and
provide recommendations regarding on-site mitigation if requested to do so by the local government
unit, a contiguous landowner, or a member of the Technical Evaluation Panel.
     Except for state public transportation projects, for which the state Department of Transportation
is responsible, the board must replace the wetlands, and wetland areas of public waters if authorized
by the commissioner or a delegated authority, drained or filled by public transportation projects on
existing roads.
    Public transportation authorities at their discretion may deviate from federal and state design
standards on existing road projects when practical and reasonable to avoid wetland filling or
draining, provided that public safety is not unreasonably compromised. The local road authority
and its officers and employees are exempt from liability for any tort claim for injury to persons or
property arising from travel on the highway and related to the deviation from the design standards
for construction or reconstruction under this paragraph. This paragraph does not preclude an action
for damages arising from negligence in construction or maintenance on a highway.
61ST DAY]                                              FRIDAY, MAY 20, 2011                                                                    3007

    (n) If a landowner seeks approval of a replacement plan after the proposed project has already
affected the wetland, the local government unit may require the landowner to replace the affected
wetland at a ratio not to exceed twice the replacement ratio otherwise required.
   (o) A local government unit may request the board to reclassify a county or watershed on
the basis of its percentage of presettlement wetlands remaining. After receipt of satisfactory
documentation from the local government, the board shall change the classification of a county
or watershed. If requested by the local government unit, the board must assist in developing the
documentation. Within 30 days of its action to approve a change of wetland classifications, the
board shall publish a notice of the change in the Environmental Quality Board Monitor.
   (p) One hundred citizens who reside within the jurisdiction of the local government unit may
request the local government unit to reclassify a county or watershed on the basis of its percentage of
presettlement wetlands remaining. In support of their petition, the citizens shall provide satisfactory
documentation to the local government unit. The local government unit shall consider the petition
and forward the request to the board under paragraph (o) or provide a reason why the petition is
denied.

      ) (d) For the purposes of this section, "reasonable, practicable, and environmentally beneficial
replacement opportunities" are defined as opportunities that:
   (1) take advantage of naturally occurring hydrogeomorphological conditions and require
minimal landscape alteration;
      (2) have a high likelihood of becoming a functional wetland that will continue in perpetuity;
   (3) do not adversely affect other habitat types or ecological communities that are important in
maintaining the overall biological diversity of the area; and
    (4) are available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing
technology, and logistics consistent with overall project purposes.
    (e) Applicants and local government units shall rely on board-approved comprehensive
inventories of replacement opportunities and watershed conditions, including the Northeast
Minnesota Wetland Mitigation Inventory and Assessment (January 2010), in determining whether
reasonable, practicable, and environmentally beneficial replacement opportunities are available.
    ­
    (g
     ­­) (f) Regulatory agencies, local government units, and other entities involved in wetland
restoration shall collaborate to identify potential replacement opportunities within their
jurisdictional areas.
      Sec. 68. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 103G.2242, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Wetland boundary or type determination. (a) A landowner may apply for a wetland
boundary or type determination from the local government unit. The landowner applying for the
determination is responsible for submitting proof necessary to make the determination, including,
but not limited to, wetland delineation field data, observation well data, topographic mapping, survey
mapping, and information regarding soils, vegetation, hydrology, and groundwater both within and
outside of the proposed wetland boundary.
    (b) A local government unit that receives an application under paragraph (a) may seek the
advice of the Technical Evaluation Panel as described in subdivision 2, and, if necessary, expand
the Technical Evaluation Panel. The local government unit may delegate the decision authority

for wetland boundary or type determinations to designated staff, or establish other procedures it
considers appropriate.
    (c) The local government unit decision must be made in compliance with section 15.99. Within
ten calendar days of the decision, the local government unit decision must be mailed or sent by
electronic transmission to the landowner, members of the Technical Evaluation Panel, the watershed
district or watershed management organization, if one exists, and individual members of the public
who request a copy.

portion of the property described in the facility's most recent permit, including any property adjacent
to that property the owner wishes to transfer, to the commissioner. The commissioner may accept
the transfer of title if the commissioner determines that to do so is in the best interest of the state. If,
after transfer of title to the property, the commissioner determines that no further response actions
are required on the portion of the property being disposed of under sections 115B.39 to 115B.445
and it is in the best interest of the state to dispose of property acquired under this subdivision, the
commissioner may do so under section 115B.17, subdivision 16. The property disposed of under
this subdivision is no longer part of the qualified facility.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 84. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 115B.412, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

are required on the property under sections 115B.39 to 115B.445, the commissioner may delist
the facility by removing it from the priority list established under section 115B.40, subdivision 2,

assessment worksheet or draft environmental impact statement is published in the EQB Monitor.
   Sec. 87. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116D.04, subdivision 2a, as amended by Laws 2011,
chapter 4, section 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. When prepared. Where there is potential for significant environmental effects
resulting from any major governmental action, the action shall be preceded by a detailed
environmental impact statement prepared by the responsible governmental unit. The environmental
impact statement shall be an analytical rather than an encyclopedic document which describes the
proposed action in detail, analyzes its significant environmental impacts, discusses appropriate
alternatives to the proposed action and their impacts, and explores methods by which adverse
environmental impacts of an action could be mitigated. The environmental impact statement shall
also analyze those economic, employment and sociological effects that cannot be avoided should
the action be implemented. To ensure its use in the decision-making process, the environmental
impact statement shall be prepared as early as practical in the formulation of an action. No
mandatory environmental impact statement may be required for an ethanol plant, as defined in
section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), that produces less than 125,000,000 gallons of
ethanol annually and is located outside of the seven-county metropolitan area.
    (a) The board shall by rule establish categories of actions for which environmental impact
statements and for which environmental assessment worksheets shall be prepared as well as
categories of actions for which no environmental review is required under this section. A mandatory
environmental assessment worksheet shall not be required for the expansion of an ethanol plant,
as defined in section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), or the conversion of an ethanol plant
to a biobutanol facility or the expansion of a biobutanol facility as defined in section 41A.105,
subdivision 1a, based on the capacity of the expanded or converted facility to produce alcohol fuel,
but must be required if the ethanol plant meets or exceeds thresholds of other categories of actions
for which environmental assessment worksheets must be prepared. The responsible governmental
unit for an ethanol plant project for which an environmental assessment worksheet is prepared
shall be the state agency with the greatest responsibility for supervising or approving the project
as a whole.
    (b) The responsible governmental unit shall promptly publish notice of the completion of
an environmental assessment worksheet in a manner to be determined by the board and shall
provide copies of the environmental assessment worksheet to the board and its member agencies.
Comments on the need for an environmental impact statement may be submitted to the responsible
governmental unit during a 30-day period following publication of the notice that an environmental
assessment worksheet has been completed. The responsible governmental unit's decision on the
need for an environmental impact statement shall be based on the environmental assessment
worksheet and the comments received during the comment period, and shall be made within 15
days after the close of the comment period. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not
more than 15 additional days upon the request of the responsible governmental unit.

    (c) An environmental assessment worksheet shall also be prepared for a proposed action
whenever material evidence accompanying a petition by not less than 2­5
                                                                      ­ 100 individuals who reside
or own property in the state, submitted before the proposed project has received final approval
by the appropriate governmental units, demonstrates that, because of the nature or location of a
proposed action, there may be potential for significant environmental effects. Petitions requesting
the preparation of an environmental assessment worksheet shall be submitted to the board. The
chair of the board shall determine the appropriate responsible governmental unit and forward the
petition to it. A decision on the need for an environmental assessment worksheet shall be made by
the responsible governmental unit within 15 days after the petition is received by the responsible
governmental unit. The board's chair may extend the 15-day period by not more than 15 additional
days upon request of the responsible governmental unit.
   (d) Except in an environmentally sensitive location where Minnesota Rules, part 4410.4300,
subpart 29, item B, applies, the proposed action is exempt from environmental review under this
chapter and rules of the board, if:
   (1) the proposed action is:
   (i) an animal feedlot facility with a capacity of less than 1,000 animal units; or
   (ii) an expansion of an existing animal feedlot facility with a total cumulative capacity of less
than 1,000 animal units;
    (2) the application for the animal feedlot facility includes a written commitment by the proposer
to design, construct, and operate the facility in full compliance with Pollution Control Agency
feedlot rules; and
    (3) the county board holds a public meeting for citizen input at least ten business days prior
to the Pollution Control Agency or county issuing a feedlot permit for the animal feedlot facility
unless another public meeting for citizen input has been held with regard to the feedlot facility to be
permitted. The exemption in this paragraph is in addition to other exemptions provided under other
law and rules of the board.
    (e) The board may, prior to final approval of a proposed project, require preparation of an
environmental assessment worksheet by a responsible governmental unit selected by the board for
any action where environmental review under this section has not been specifically provided for by
rule or otherwise initiated.
    (f) An early and open process shall be utilized to limit the scope of the environmental impact
statement to a discussion of those impacts, which, because of the nature or location of the project,
have the potential for significant environmental effects. The same process shall be utilized to
determine the form, content and level of detail of the statement as well as the alternatives which
are appropriate for consideration in the statement. In addition, the permits which will be required
for the proposed action shall be identified during the scoping process. Further, the process shall
identify those permits for which information will be developed concurrently with the environmental
impact statement. The board shall provide in its rules for the expeditious completion of the scoping
process. The determinations reached in the process shall be incorporated into the order requiring
the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
   (g) The responsible governmental unit shall, to the extent practicable, avoid duplication and

ensure coordination between state and federal environmental review and between environmental
review and environmental permitting. Whenever practical, information needed by a governmental
unit for making final decisions on permits or other actions required for a proposed project shall be
developed in conjunction with the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (h) An environmental impact statement shall be prepared and its adequacy determined within
280 days after notice of its preparation unless the time is extended by consent of the parties or
by the governor for good cause. The responsible governmental unit shall determine the adequacy
of an environmental impact statement, unless within 60 days after notice is published that an
environmental impact statement will be prepared, the board chooses to determine the adequacy of
an environmental impact statement. If an environmental impact statement is found to be inadequate,
the responsible governmental unit shall have 60 days to prepare an adequate environmental impact
statement.
    (i) The proposer of a specific action may include in the information submitted to the responsible
governmental unit a preliminary draft environmental impact statement under this section on
that action for review, modification, and determination of completeness and adequacy by the
responsible governmental unit. A preliminary draft environmental impact statement prepared by
the project proposer and submitted to the responsible governmental unit shall identify or include as
an appendix all studies and other sources of information used to substantiate the analysis contained
in the preliminary draft environmental impact statement. The responsible governmental unit shall
require additional studies, if needed, and obtain from the project proposer all additional studies and
information necessary for the responsible governmental unit to perform its responsibility to review,
modify, and determine the completeness and adequacy of the environmental impact statement.

   S.F. No. 1101: A bill for an act relating to human services; establishing the My Life, My Choices
Task Force.
   Senator Hann moved to amend S.F. No. 1101 as follows:
   Page 1, after line 3, insert:
   "Section 1. [15.996] PERFORMANCE-BASED ORGANIZATIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Designation. The governor may designate one or more programs within the
Department of Human Services and within up to two other executive branch state agencies whose
missions involve people with disabilities as performance-based organizations. The goal of the
performance-based organization designation is to provide the best services in the most cost-effective
manner to people with disabilities. For a program that is designated as a performance-based
organization, the agency providing services or another governmental or private organization under
contract with the agency may enter into a performance-based agreement that allows the agency
or the entity under contract with the agency more flexibility in its operations in exchange for
a greater level of accountability. With any required legislative approval, a performance-based
organization agreement may exempt an agency or an outside entity providing services from one or
more procedural laws, rules, or policies that otherwise would govern the program.
3028                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                               [61ST DAY

    Subd. 2. Performance-based organization agreement. Designation of a performance-based
organization must be implemented through a performance-based organization agreement. A
performance-based organization agreement may be between the governor and an agency, if an
agency is to provide services under the agreement, or between an agency and an outside entity, if
the outside entity is to provide the services. A performance-based organization agreement must:
    (1) describe the programs subject to the agreement;
   (2) specify the procedural laws, rules, or policies that will not apply to the performance-based
organization, why waiver or variance from these laws, rules, or policies is necessary to achieve
desired outcomes, and a description of alternative means of accomplishing the purposes of those
laws, rules, or policies;
   (3) contain procedures for oversight of the performance-based organization, including
requirements and procedures for program and financial audits;
   (4) if the performance-based organization involves a nonstate entity, contain provisions
governing assumption of liability, and types and amounts of insurance coverage to be obtained;
    (5) specify the duration of the agreement; and
    (6) specify measurable performance-based outcomes for achieving program goals, time periods
during which these outcomes will be measured and reported, and consequences for not meeting the
performance-based outcomes.
   Subd. 3. Duration; legislative approval; reporting. (a) A performance-based organization
agreement may be up to three years, and may be renewed.
    (b) The chief executive of the state agency whose program is subject to a performance-based
organization must report to the chairs and ranking minority members of legislative policy
and finance committees with jurisdiction over the program on the proposed content of the
performance-based organization, and specifically describing any procedural laws, rules, and
policies that will not apply. The legislature must approve a performance-based organization before
the state agency may enter into a performance-based agreement."
    Renumber the sections in sequence and correct the internal references
    Amend the title accordingly
    The motion prevailed. So the amendment was adopted.
    S.F. No. 1101 was read the third time, as amended, and placed on its final passage.
