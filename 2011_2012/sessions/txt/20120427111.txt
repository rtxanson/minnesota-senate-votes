    The Board of Trustees of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities shall establish a
work group to study methods that result in lower textbook costs for students. Methods include
studying alternative textbook delivery methods, including a cross-campus shared delivery system
for textbooks, the expansion of electronic textbooks with an assessment of effective methods for
delivering e-books to students, and other technology-based innovative or best practices methods to
bring real cost savings to students. The goal of this work group is to help assess current practices,
present a stable of business strategies, technologies, and campus deployment plans that are effective
in driving down the cost of learning resources for students while offering greater access to no- or
low-cost academic content for faculty.
