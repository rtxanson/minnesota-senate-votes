commission or committee.

    (d) Within 14 days after the filing of an objection by the commission or committee to a rule or
proposed rule, the issuing agency shall respond in writing to the objecting entity. After receipt of the
response, the commission or committee may withdraw or modify its objection. After the filing of an
objection that is not subsequently withdrawn, the agency may not adopt the rule until the legislature
adjourns the annual legislative session that began after the vote of the commission or committee. The
commission or committee that files an objection that is not subsequently withdrawn must, as soon
as practical, make a recommendation on a bill that approves the proposed rule, prohibits adoption
of the proposed rule, or amends or repeals the law governing a previously adopted rule for which
an objection was filed.
    (e) After the filing of an objection by the commission or committee that is not subsequently
withdrawn, the burden is upon the agency in any proceeding for judicial review or for enforcement
of the rule to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the whole or portion of the rule objected
to is valid and demonstrates that the objection raised under paragraph (a) is not justified, based on
the criteria for objecting to a rule under paragraph (a).
   (f) The failure of the commission or a committee to object to a rule is not an implied legislative
authorization of its validity.
    (g) In accordance with sections 14.44 and 14.45, the commission or a committee may petition
for a declaratory judgment to determine the validity of a rule objected to by the commission or
committee. The action must be started within two years after an objection is filed in the Office of
the Secretary of State.
    (h) The commission or a committee may intervene in litigation arising from agency action. For
purposes of this paragraph, agency action means the whole or part of a rule, or the failure to issue
a rule.
       Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 3D.06, is amended to read:
       3D.06 AGENCY REPORT TO COMMISSION.

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 3D.10, is amended to read:
   3D.10 CRITERIA FOR REVIEW.
    The commission and its staff shall consider the following criteria in determining whether a public
need exists for the continuation of a state agency or its advisory committees or for the performance
of the functions of the agency or its advisory committees:
   (1) the efficiency and effectiveness with which the agency or the advisory committee operates;
   (2) an identification of the mission, goals, and objectives intended for the agency or advisory
committee and of the problem or need that the agency or advisory committee was intended to address
and the extent to which the mission, goals, and objectives have been achieved and the problem or
need has been addressed;
    (3) an identification of any activities of the agency in addition to those granted by statute and of
the authority for those activities and the extent to which those activities are needed;
   (4) an assessment of authority of the agency relating to fees, inspections, enforcement, and
penalties;
    (5) whether less restrictive or alternative methods of performing any function that the agency
performs could adequately protect or provide service to the public;
   (6) the extent to which the jurisdiction of the agency and the programs administered by the
agency overlap or duplicate those of other agencies, the extent to which the agency coordinates with
those agencies, and the extent to which the programs administered by the agency can be consolidated
with the programs of other state agencies;
    (7) the promptness and effectiveness with which the agency addresses complaints concerning
entities or other persons affected by the agency, including an assessment of the agency's

   (b) The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the notice.
     (c) The notice must inform taxpayers that it contains the amount of property taxes each taxing

and an address where comments will be received by mail, except that no notice required under this
section shall be interpreted as requiring the printing of a personal telephone number or address as
the contact information for a taxing authority. If a taxing authority does not maintain public offices
where telephone calls can be received by the authority, the authority may inform the county of the
lack of a public telephone number and the county shall not list a telephone number for that taxing
authority.
   (d) The notice must state for each parcel:
    (1) the market value of the property as determined under section 273.11, and used for computing
property taxes payable in the following year and for taxes payable in the current year as each appears

    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed
amount that a referendum is pending and that, if approved by the voters, the tax amount may be
higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, the levy for Minneapolis
Park and Recreation shall be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the
case of the city of St. Paul, the levy for the St. Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from
the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under
section 134.07 may be listed separately from the remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case
of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F
applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity
subject to the areawide tax must each be stated separately and not included in the sum of the special
taxing districts; and
   (3) the increase or decrease between the total taxes payable in the current year and the total
proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.

   (6) the contamination tax imposed on properties which received market value reductions for
contamination.
    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 7, failure of the county auditor to prepare or the county
treasurer to deliver the notice as required in this section does not invalidate the proposed or final tax
levy or the taxes payable pursuant to the tax levy.
    (g) If the notice the taxpayer receives under this section lists the property as nonhomestead,
and satisfactory documentation is provided to the county assessor by the applicable deadline, and
the property qualifies for the homestead classification in that assessment year, the assessor shall
reclassify the property to homestead for taxes payable in the following year.

days or more, the taxpayer must either:

lessee; or
   (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
    The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of
receipt of the notice, whichever is later. A taxpayer may notify the county treasurer of the address
of the taxpayer, agent, caretaker, or manager of the premises to which the notice must be mailed in
order to fulfill the requirements of this paragraph.

person shall have a right of action to recover on such bond for any breach of its conditions, but the
aggregate liability of the surety to all such persons shall in no event exceed the amount of the bond.
Unless the department has been notified of the pendency of an action to recover on the bond and if all
questions as to ownership and outstanding security interests have been resolved to the satisfaction
of the department, such bond, and any deposit accompanying it, shall be returned at the end of three
years or prior thereto in the event the vehicle is no longer registered in this state and the currently

    Subdivision 1. Construction code fund. (a) There is created in the state treasury a construction
code fund as a special revenue fund for the purpose of administering this chapter, sections 327.31
to 327.36, and chapter 327B. All money collected under those sections, except penalties, is credited
to the construction code fund unless otherwise specifically designated by law. Any interest or
profit accruing from investment of these sums is credited to the construction code fund. All money
collected in the construction code fund is appropriated to the commissioner of labor and industry
to administer and enforce the provisions of the laws identified in this section.
   (b) Unless otherwise provided by law, all penalties assessed under this chapter, section 327.35,
and chapter 327B are credited to the assigned risk safety account established by section 79.253.
    (c) Electrical inspections shall be continued, regardless of whether all or any part of the
biennial appropriation law for the department has been enacted. The amount necessary to conduct
electrical inspections when the biennial appropriation law has not been enacted is appropriated
from the construction code fund. If, by July 1 of an odd-numbered year, legislation has not
been enacted to appropriate money to the commissioner of management and budget for central
accounting, procurement, payroll, and human resources functions, amounts necessary to operate
those functions for the purpose of this paragraph are appropriated from the general fund to the
commissioner of management and budget. As necessary, the commissioner may transfer a portion
of this appropriation to other state agencies to support carrying out these functions. Any subsequent
appropriation to the commissioner of management and budget for a biennium in which this
paragraph has been applied supersedes and replaces the funding authorized in this paragraph."

licensed under Minnesota Rules, parts 9555.5105 to 9555.6265, under this chapter for a physical
location that will not be the primary residence of the license holder for the entire period of licensure.
If a license is issued during this moratorium, and the license holder changes the license holder's
primary residence away from the physical location of the foster care license, the commissioner shall
revoke the license according to section 245A.07. Exceptions to the moratorium include:
   (1) foster care settings that are required to be registered under chapter 144D;

under this subdivision. As part of the determination, the commissioner shall consider the availability
of foster care capacity in the area in which the licensee seeks to operate, and the recommendation
of the local county board. The determination by the commissioner must be final. A determination
of need is not required for a change in ownership at the same address.

the commissioner whether the physical location where the foster care will be provided is or will
be the primary residence of the license holder for the entire period of licensure. If the primary
residence of the applicant or license holder changes, the applicant or license holder must notify
the commissioner immediately. The commissioner shall print on the foster care license certificate
whether or not the physical location is the primary residence of the license holder.
    (f) License holders of foster care homes identified under paragraph (e) that are not the primary
residence of the license holder and that also provide services in the foster care home that are covered
by a federally approved home and community-based services waiver, as authorized under section
256B.0915, 256B.092, or 256B.49 must inform the human services licensing division that the license
holder provides or intends to provide these waiver-funded services. These license holders must be
considered registered under section 256B.092, subdivision 11, paragraph (c), and this registration
status must be identified on their license certificates."

    (c) For the purposes of this subdivision, "in-reach community-based service coordination"
means the practice of a community-based worker with training, knowledge, skills, and ability to
access a continuum of services, including housing, transportation, chemical and mental health
treatment, employment, and peer support services, by working with an organization's staff to
transition an individual back into the individual's living environment. In-reach community-based
service coordination includes working with the individual during their discharge and for up to a
defined amount of time in the individual's living environment, reducing the individual's need for

section may file a notice of potential claim under this subdivision anytime before or within one year
after a medical assistance recipient dies. The claimant shall be the state agency. A notice filed prior
to the recipient's death shall not take effect and shall not be effective as notice until the recipient
dies. A notice filed after a recipient dies shall be effective from the time of filing.
    (b) The notice of claim shall be filed or recorded in the real estate records in the office of the
county recorder or registrar of titles for each county in which any part of the property is located.
The recorder shall accept the notice for recording or filing. The registrar of titles shall accept the
notice for filing if the recipient has a recorded interest in the property. The registrar of titles shall
not carry forward to a new certificate of title any notice filed more than one year from the date of
the recipient's death.
    (c) The notice must be dated, state the name of the claimant, the medical assistance recipient's
name and last four digits of the Social Security number if filed before their death and their date of
death if filed after they die, the name and date of death of any predeceased spouse of the medical
assistance recipient for whom a claim may exist, a statement that the claimant may have a claim
arising under this section, generally identify the recipient's interest in the property, contain a legal
description for the property and whether it is abstract or registered property, a statement of when
the notice becomes effective and the effect of the notice, be signed by an authorized representative
of the state agency, and may include such other contents as the state agency may deem appropriate.
   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 256B.15, subdivision 1f, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1f. Agency lien. (a) The notice shall constitute a lien in favor of the Department of Human
Services against the recipient's interests in the real estate it describes for a period of 20 years from
the date of filing or the date of the recipient's death, whichever is later. Notwithstanding any law
or rule to the contrary, a recipient's life estate and joint tenancy interests shall not end upon the
recipient's death but shall continue according to subdivisions 1h, 1i, and 1j. The amount of the lien
shall be equal to the total amount of the claims that could be presented in the recipient's estate under
this section.
    (b) If no estate has been opened for the deceased recipient, any holder of an interest in the
property may apply to the lienholder for a statement of the amount of the lien or for a full or partial
release of the lien. The application shall include the applicant's name, current mailing address,
current home and work telephone numbers, and a description of their interest in the property, a

legal description of the recipient's interest in the property, and the deceased recipient's name, date of
birth, and last four digits of the Social Security number. The lienholder shall send the applicant by
certified mail, return receipt requested, a written statement showing the amount of the lien, whether
the lienholder is willing to release the lien and under what conditions, and inform them of the right to
a hearing under section 256.045. The lienholder shall have the discretion to compromise and settle
the lien upon any terms and conditions the lienholder deems appropriate.
    (c) Any holder of an interest in property subject to the lien has a right to request a hearing under
section 256.045 to determine the validity, extent, or amount of the lien. The request must be in
writing, and must include the names, current addresses, and home and business telephone numbers
for all other parties holding an interest in the property. A request for a hearing by any holder of an
interest in the property shall be deemed to be a request for a hearing by all parties owning interests
in the property. Notice of the hearing shall be given to the lienholder, the party filing the appeal, and
all of the other holders of interests in the property at the addresses listed in the appeal by certified
mail, return receipt requested, or by ordinary mail. Any owner of an interest in the property to whom
notice of the hearing is mailed shall be deemed to have waived any and all claims or defenses in
respect to the lien unless they appear and assert any claims or defenses at the hearing.
    (d) If the claim the lien secures could be filed under subdivision 1h, the lienholder may collect,
compromise, settle, or release the lien upon any terms and conditions it deems appropriate. If the
claim the lien secures could be filed under subdivision 1i or 1j, the lien may be adjusted or enforced
to the same extent had it been filed under subdivisions 1i and 1j, and the provisions of subdivisions
1i, clause (f), and 1j, clause (d), shall apply to voluntary payment, settlement, or satisfaction of the
lien.
    (e) If no probate proceedings have been commenced for the recipient as of the date the lien holder
executes a release of the lien on a recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interest, created for purposes
of this section, the release shall terminate the life estate or joint tenancy interest created under this
section as of the date it is recorded or filed to the extent of the release. If the claimant executes
a release for purposes of extinguishing a life estate or a joint tenancy interest created under this
section to remove a cloud on title to real property, the release shall have the effect of extinguishing
any life estate or joint tenancy interests in the property it describes which may have been continued
by reason of this section retroactive to the date of death of the deceased life tenant or joint tenant
except as provided for in section 514.981, subdivision 6.
    (f) If the deceased recipient's estate is probated, a claim shall be filed under this section. The
amount of the lien shall be limited to the amount of the claim as finally allowed. If the claim the
lien secures is filed under subdivision 1h, the lien may be released in full after any allowance of the
claim becomes final or according to any agreement to settle and satisfy the claim. The release shall
release the lien but shall not extinguish or terminate the interest being released. If the claim the lien
secures is filed under subdivision 1i or 1j, the lien shall be released after the lien under subdivision
1i or 1j is filed or recorded, or settled according to any agreement to settle and satisfy the claim. The
release shall not extinguish or terminate the interest being released. If the claim is finally disallowed
in full, the claimant shall release the claimant's lien at the claimant's expense."

    Subd. 5a. Cost estimate of a moratorium exception project. (a) For the purposes of this section
and section 144A.073, the cost estimate of a moratorium exception project shall include the effects
of the proposed project on the costs of the state subsidy for community-based services, nursing
services, and housing in institutional and noninstitutional settings. The commissioner of health, in
cooperation with the commissioner of human services, shall define the method for estimating these
costs in the permanent rule implementing section 144A.073. The commissioner of human services
shall prepare an estimate of the total state annual long-term costs of each moratorium exception
proposal.
    (b) The interest rate to be used for estimating the cost of each moratorium exception project
proposal shall be the lesser of either the prime rate plus two percentage points, or the posted yield
for standard conventional fixed rate mortgages of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
plus two percentage points as published in the Wall Street Journal and in effect 56 days prior to
the application deadline. If the applicant's proposal uses this interest rate, the commissioner of

upon completion of the project must use the actual interest rate obtained by the facility for the
project's permanent financing up to the maximum permitted under ­   su­b

part 9549.0060, subpart 6.
    The applicant may choose an alternate interest rate for estimating the project's cost. If the
applicant makes this election, the commissioner of human services, in determining the facility's
actual property-related payment rate to be established upon completion of the project, must use the
lesser of the actual interest rate obtained for the project's permanent financing or the interest rate
which was used to estimate the proposal's project cost. For succeeding rate years, the applicant is
at risk for financing costs in excess of the interest rate selected.

      Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
      Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
      "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 241.016, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Biennial report. (a) The Department of Corrections shall submit a performance
report to the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate and house of representatives
committees and divisions having jurisdiction over criminal justice funding by January 15 of each
odd-numbered year. The issuance and content of the report must include the following:
      (1) department strategic mission, goals, and objectives;
   (2) the department-wide per diem, adult facility-specific per diems, and an average per diem,
reported in a standard calculated method as outlined in the departmental policies and procedures;
      (3) department annual statistics as outlined in the departmental policies and procedures; and
   (4) information about prison-based mental health programs, including, but not limited to, the
availability of these programs, participation rates, and completion rates.
    (b) The department shall maintain recidivism rates for adult facilities on an annual basis. In
addition, each year the department shall, on an alternating basis, complete a recidivism analysis of
adult facilities, juvenile services, and the community services divisions and include a three-year
recidivism analysis in the report described in paragraph (a). The recidivism analysis must: (1)
assess education programs, vocational programs, treatment programs, including mental health
programs, industry, and employment; and (2) assess statewide re-entry policies and funding,
including postrelease treatment, education, training, and supervision. In addition, when reporting
recidivism for the department's adult and juvenile facilities, the department shall report on the
extent to which offenders it has assessed as chemically dependent commit new offenses, with
separate recidivism rates reported for persons completing and not completing the department's
treatment programs.
