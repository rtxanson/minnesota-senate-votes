sustainable forest tax payment to a claimant under chapter 290C.
    For purposes of this chapter, lottery prizes, as set forth in section 349A.08, subdivision 8, and
amounts granted to persons by the legislature on the recommendation of the joint senate-house of
representatives Subcommittee on Claims shall be treated as refunds.
    In the case of a joint property tax refund payable to spouses under chapter 290A, the refund
shall be considered as belonging to each spouse in the proportion of the total refund that equals
each spouse's proportion of the total income determined under section 290A.03, subdivision 3.
In the case of a joint income tax refund under chapter 289A, the refund shall be considered as
belonging to each spouse in the proportion of the total refund that equals each spouse's proportion
of the total taxable income determined under section 290.01, subdivision 29. The commissioner
shall remit the entire refund to the claimant agency, which shall, upon the request of the spouse
who does not owe the debt, determine the amount of the refund belonging to that spouse and refund
the amount to that spouse. For court fines, fees, and surcharges and court-ordered restitution under
section 611A.04, subdivision 2, the notice provided by the commissioner of revenue under section
270A.07, subdivision 2, paragraph (b), serves as the appropriate legal notice to the spouse who does
not owe the debt.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for refund claims based on contributions made
after June 30, 2011.

    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.1384, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 7. Credit reductions and limitation; counties and cities. (a) In 2011 and 2012, the
market value credit reimbursement payment to each county and city authorized under subdivision
4 may not exceed the reimbursement payment received by the county or city for taxes payable in
2010.
    (b) In 2013 and each year thereafter, the market value credit reimbursement amount for each
city and county determined under this section is reduced by the dollar amount of the reduction in
market value credit reimbursements for that city or county in 2010 due to the reductions under
section 477A.0133. No taxing jurisdiction's market value credit reimbursements are reduced to less
than zero under this subdivision. The commissioner of revenue shall pay the annual market value
credit reimbursement amounts, after reduction under this subdivision, to the affected city or county
as provided in this section.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for credit reimbursements in 2011 and thereafter.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.50, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. General right to refund. (a) Subject to the requirements of this section and
section 289A.40, a taxpayer who has paid a tax in excess of the taxes lawfully due and who files a
written claim for refund will be refunded or credited the overpayment of the tax determined by the
commissioner to be erroneously paid.
    (b) The claim must specify the name of the taxpayer, the date when and the period for which the
tax was paid, the kind of tax paid, the amount of the tax that the taxpayer claims was erroneously
paid, the grounds on which a refund is claimed, and other information relative to the payment and in
the form required by the commissioner. An income tax, estate tax, or corporate franchise tax return,
or amended return claiming an overpayment constitutes a claim for refund.
    (c) When, in the course of an examination, and within the time for requesting a refund, the
commissioner determines that there has been an overpayment of tax, the commissioner shall
refund or credit the overpayment to the taxpayer and no demand is necessary. If the overpayment
exceeds $1, the amount of the overpayment must be refunded to the taxpayer. If the amount of the
overpayment is less than $1, the commissioner is not required to refund. In these situations, the
commissioner does not have to make written findings or serve notice by mail to the taxpayer.
   (d) If the amount allowable as a credit for withholding, estimated taxes, or dependent care
exceeds the tax against which the credit is allowable, the amount of the excess is considered

   (e) If the entertainment tax withheld at the source exceeds by $1 or more the taxes, penalties,
and interest reported in the return of the entertainment entity or imposed by section 290.9201, the

need not refund that amount.
    (f) If the surety deposit required for a construction contract exceeds the liability of the
out-of-state contractor, the commissioner shall refund the difference to the contractor.
   (g) An action of the commissioner in refunding the amount of the overpayment does not
constitute a determination of the correctness of the return of the taxpayer.
   (h) There is appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of revenue the amount
necessary to pay refunds allowed under this section.

capacity under the process described in section 469.174, subdivision 28.
    (f) If a city's net tax capacity used in calculating aid under this section has decreased in any year
by more than 25 percent from its net tax capacity in the previous year due to property becoming
tax-exempt Indian land, the city's maximum allowed aid increase under paragraph (c) shall be
increased by an amount equal to (1) the city's tax rate in the year of the aid calculation, multiplied
by (2) the amount of its net tax capacity decrease resulting from the property becoming tax exempt.

15A.082, except as provided in this subdivision. For purposes of this subdivision, "political
subdivision of this state" includes a statutory or home rule charter city, county, town, metropolitan
or regional agency, or other political subdivision, but does not include a hospital, clinic, or health
maintenance organization owned by such a governmental unit.
    (b) Beginning in 2006, the limit in paragraph (a) must be adjusted annually in January. The
limit must equal the limit for the prior year increased by the percentage increase, if any, in the
Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers from October of the second prior year to October of

for an employee are included in determining the employee's salary. Other forms of compensation
which must be included to determine an employee's total compensation are all other direct and
indirect items of compensation which are not specifically excluded by this subdivision. Other forms

   The value of other forms of compensation is the annual cost to the political subdivision for the
provision of the compensation.
    (d) The salary of a medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy occupying a position that the governing
body of the political subdivision has determined requires an M.D. or D.O. degree is excluded from
the limitation in this subdivision.
    (e) The commissioner may increase the limitation in this subdivision for a position that the
commissioner has determined requires special expertise necessitating a higher salary to attract
or retain a qualified person. The commissioner shall review each proposed increase giving due
consideration to salary rates paid to other persons with similar responsibilities in the state and
nation. The commissioner may not increase the limitation until the commissioner has presented
the proposed increase to the Legislative Coordinating Commission and received the commission's
recommendation on it. The recommendation is advisory only. If the commission does not give
its recommendation on a proposed increase within 30 days from its receipt of the proposal, the
commission is deemed to have made no recommendation. If the commissioner grants or granted
an increase under this paragraph, the new limitation must be adjusted beginning in August 2005
and in each subsequent calendar year in January by the percentage increase equal to the percentage
increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers from October of the second
prior year to October of the immediately prior year.
