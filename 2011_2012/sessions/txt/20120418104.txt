the Senate March 5, 2012, as follows:
   (The text of the amended House File is identical to S.F. No. 1825.)
   Page 3, after line 23, insert:
   "Sec. 4. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
    The intent of the legislature in enacting this bill is to clarify a cross-referencing change made in
2007 relating to the criminal vehicular operation crime. It was not the legislature's intent in 2007 to
make a substantive change regarding whether prior criminal vehicular operation convictions would
qualify as prior impaired driving convictions or prior impaired driving-related losses of licenses
or be considered as a predicate for the first-degree driving while impaired crime. The legislature's
intent has always been that criminal vehicular operation convictions under both the pre-2007 law
and the post-2007 law be used for enhancing driving while impaired penalties consistent with the
provisions of the driving while impaired laws."
   The motion prevailed. So the amendment was adopted.
