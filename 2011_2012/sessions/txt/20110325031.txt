No more than two questions may be submitted at a mail election and no offices may be voted on.
Notice of the election must be given to the county auditor at least 53 days prior to the election. This
notice shall also fulfill the requirements of Minnesota Rules, part 8210.3000. The special mail ballot
procedures must be posted at least six weeks prior to the election. Not more than 30 nor later than 14
days prior to the election, the auditor or clerk shall mail ballots by nonforwardable mail to all voters
registered in the county, municipality, or school district. No later than 14 days before the election,
the auditor or clerk must make a subsequent mailing of ballots to those voters who register to vote
after the initial mailing but before the 20th day before the election. Eligible voters not registered at
the time the ballots are mailed may apply for ballots pursuant to chapter 203B. The auditor or clerk

"Accepted" or "Rejected" within three days of receipt if there are 14 or fewer days before election
day, or within five days of receipt if there are more than 14 days before election day. The board may

the voter's ballot has been rejected. The official must document the attempts made to contact the
voter.

before the election, the ballots from return envelopes marked "Accepted" may be opened, duplicated

deposited in the appropriate ballot box.

Commission or appropriate federal agency responsible for testing and certification of compliance
with the federal voting systems guidelines at the time of submission of the application required
by subdivision 1 to be in conformity with voluntary voting system guidelines issued by the
Election Assistance Commission or other previously referenced agency. The application must
be accompanied by the certification report of the voting systems test laboratory. A certification
under this section from an independent testing authority accredited by the Election Assistance
Commission or other previously referenced agency meets the requirement of Minnesota Rules,
part 8220.0350, item L. A vendor must provide a copy of the source code for the voting system
to the secretary of state. A chair of a major political party or the secretary of state may select, in
consultation with the vendor, an independent third-party evaluator to examine the source code to
ensure that it functions as represented by the vendor and that the code is free from defects. A major
political party that elects to have the source code examined must pay for the examination. Except
as provided by this subdivision, a source code that is trade secret information must be treated as
nonpublic information, according to section 13.37. A third-party evaluator must not disclose the
source code to anyone else."

representatives and senate committees with
jurisdiction over transportation finance, may
transfer all or part of the unappropriated

to the vehicle. If there is no rearview mirror or if the certificate holder's disability precludes placing
the certificate on the mirror, the certificate must be displayed on the dashboard on the driver's side
of the vehicle. No part of the certificate may be obscured.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), clauses (1), (2), and (3), this section does not permit parking
in areas prohibited by sections 169.32 and 169.34, in designated no parking spaces, or in parking
spaces reserved for specified purposes or vehicles. A local governmental unit may, by ordinance,
prohibit parking on any street or highway to create a fire lane, or to accommodate heavy traffic
during morning and afternoon rush hours and these ordinances also apply to physically disabled
persons.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.345, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Identifying certificate. (a) The commissioner shall issue (1) immediately, a permit

identifying certificate for a m
                              oo
                                 tr vehicle described in section 168.021, subdivision 1, paragraph
(a), when a physically disabled applicant submits proof of physical disability under subdivision
2a. The commissioner shall design separate certificates for persons with permanent and temporary
disabilities that can be readily distinguished from each other from outside a m   oo
                                                                                     t
                                                                                       r vehicle at a

applicant may be issued up to two certificates if the applicant has not been issued disability plates
under section 168.021.
    (b) The operator of a m
                          oo
                             tr vehicle displaying a certificate has the parking privileges provided
in subdivision 1 only while the m  oo
                                      tr vehicle is actually parked while transporting a physically
disabled person.
    (c) The commissioner shall cancel all certificates issued to an applicant who fails to comply with
the requirements of this subdivision.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 169.86, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Fees; proceeds deposited; appropriation. The commissioner, with respect to
highways under the commissioner's jurisdiction, may charge a fee for each permit issued. All
such fees for permits issued by the commissioner of transportation shall be deposited in the state
treasury and credited to the trunk highway fund. Except for those annual permits for which the
permit fees are specified elsewhere in this chapter, the fees shall be:
   (a) $15 for each single trip permit.
    (b) $36 for each job permit. A job permit may be issued for like loads carried on a specific route
for a period not to exceed two months. "Like loads" means loads of the same product, weight, and
dimension.
  (c) $60 for an annual permit to be issued for a period not to exceed 12 consecutive months.
Annual permits may be issued for:
    (1) motor vehicles used to alleviate a temporary crisis adversely affecting the safety or well-being
of the public;

      (6) noncommercial transportation of a boat by the owner or user of the boat;
      (7) motor vehicles carrying bales of agricultural products authorized under section 169.862; and
      (8) special milk-hauling vehicles authorized under section 169.867.
  (d) $120 for an oversize annual permit to be issued for a period not to exceed 12 consecutive
months. Annual permits may be issued for:
      (1) mobile cranes;
      (2) construction equipment, machinery, and supplies;
      (3) manufactured homes and manufactured storage buildings;
      (4) implements of husbandry;
      (5) double-deck buses;
    (6) commercial boat hauling and transporting waterfront structures, including, but not limited
to, portable boat docks and boat lifts;
    (7) three-vehicle combinations consisting of two empty, newly manufactured trailers for cargo,
horses, or livestock, not to exceed 28-1/2 feet per trailer; provided, however, the permit allows
the vehicles to be moved from a trailer manufacturer to a trailer dealer only while operating on
twin-trailer routes designated under section 169.81, subdivision 3, paragraph (c); and
   (8) vehicles operating on that portion of marked Trunk Highway 36 described in section 169.81,
subdivision 3, paragraph (e).
    (e) For vehicles which have axle weights exceeding the weight limitations of sections 169.823
to 169.829, an additional cost added to the fees listed above. However, this paragraph applies to
any vehicle described in section 168.013, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), but only when the vehicle
exceeds its gross weight allowance set forth in that paragraph, and then the additional cost is for
all weight, including the allowance weight, in excess of the permitted maximum axle weight. The
additional cost is equal to the product of the distance traveled times the sum of the overweight axle
group cost factors shown in the following chart:

The amounts added are rounded to the nearest cent for each axle or axle group. The additional cost
does not apply to paragraph (c), clauses (1) and (3).
For a vehicle found to exceed the appropriate maximum permitted weight, a cost-per-mile fee of 22
cents per ton, or fraction of a ton, over the permitted maximum weight is imposed in addition to the
normal permit fee. Miles must be calculated based on the distance already traveled in the state plus
the distance from the point of detection to a transportation loading site or unloading site within the
state or to the point of exit from the state.
   (f) As an alternative to paragraph (e), an annual permit may be issued for overweight, or oversize
and overweight, mobile cranes; construction equipment, machinery, and supplies; implements of
husbandry; and commercial boat hauling. The fees for the permit are as follows:
             Gross Weight (pounds) of Vehicle                           Annual Permit Fee

                       100,001 - 110,000                                       $400
                       110,001 - 120,000                                       $500
                       120,001 - 130,000                                       $600
                       130,001 - 140,000                                       $700
                       140,001 - 145,000                                       $800

If the gross weight of the vehicle is more than 145,000 pounds the permit fee is determined under
paragraph (e).
