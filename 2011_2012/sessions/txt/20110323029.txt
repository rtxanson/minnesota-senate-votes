    (a) Within 30 days of the effective date of this section, the commissioner of the Pollution
Control Agency shall initiate a process to amend Minnesota Rules, chapter 7050, which may be
accomplished through a rulemaking already in progress, related to the water quality standards
contained in Minnesota Rules, chapter 7050, establishing a standard for sulfates for Class 4 waters.
The Pollution Control Agency shall take the actions necessary to ensure that the revised standards
are effective no later than December 30, 2012. The amended rule shall:
   (1) establish a water quality standard for sulfates for waters containing natural beds of wild rice,
as well as for irrigation waters used for the production of wild rice; and
    (2) designate each body of water, or specific portion thereof, to which the wild rice water quality
standards apply and the specific times of year during which the standard applies.
    (b) "Waters containing natural beds of wild rice" means waters where significant quantities of
wild rice occur naturally. Before designating waters containing natural beds of wild rice as waters
subject to a standard, the commissioner shall establish criteria for the waters after consultation with
the Department of Natural Resources, Minnesota Indian tribes, and other interested parties, and after
public notice and comment. The criteria shall include, but not be limited to, documented history of
wild rice harvests, minimum acreage, and wild rice density. Waters where individual wild rice plants
or isolated, sparse stands of wild rice exist shall not be designated as subject to the standard.
    (c) Within 30 days of the effective date of this section, the commissioner of the Pollution
Control Agency must create an advisory group to provide input to the commissioner on a protocol
for scientific research to assess the impacts of sulfates and other substances on the growth of
wild rice, review research results, and provide other advice on the development of future rule
amendments to protect wild rice. The group must include representatives of tribal governments,
municipal wastewater treatment facilities, industrial dischargers, wild rice harvesters, and wild rice
research experts.
    (d) After receiving the advice of the advisory group under paragraph (c), consultation with the
commissioner of natural resources, and review of all available scientific research on water quality
and other environmental impacts on the growth of wild rice, the commissioner shall adopt and
implement a wild rice research plan using the money appropriated to contract with appropriate
scientific experts. The commissioner shall periodically review the results of the research with the
commissioner of natural resources and the advisory group.
    (e) Upon completion of the research referenced in paragraph (d), the commissioner shall initiate
a process to amend agency rules to revise water quality standards related to the protection of wild
rice to be consistent with the results of the research.
    (f) Until the rule amendment described in paragraph (e) is complete, in any permit issued for
the discharge of wastewater, the Pollution Control Agency may require only that the permittee
monitor sulfate concentrations in discharges, and, if appropriate, based on site-specific conditions,
implement a sulfate minimization plan to avoid or minimize sulfate concentrations during periods
when wild rice may be susceptible to damage, but shall not require expenditures for design

representatives and senate on the status of implementation of this section. The report must include

suspend the standard for sulfates for Class 4 waters.

    Sec. 2. RULE AMENDMENT; EXPEDITED RULEMAKING.
    The Pollution Control Agency shall amend Minnesota Rules, part 7050.0224, subpart 2, to delete

exemption under Minnesota Statutes, section 14.388, subdivision 1, clause (3), to adopt rules and

14.388.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
