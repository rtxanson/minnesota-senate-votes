of transportation for a biennium in which this subdivision has been applied shall supersede and
replace the funding authorized in this subdivision.

enacted to appropriate money for the next biennium to the commissioner of management and budget
for central accounting, procurement, payroll, and human resources functions, amounts necessary to

    (e) For vehicles which have axle weights exceeding the weight limitations of sections 169.823
to 169.829, an additional cost added to the fees listed above. However, this paragraph applies to
any vehicle described in section 168.013, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), but only when the vehicle

The amounts added are rounded to the nearest cent for each axle or axle group. The additional cost
does not apply to paragraph (c), clauses (1) and (3).
For a vehicle found to exceed the appropriate maximum permitted weight, a cost-per-mile fee of 22
cents per ton, or fraction of a ton, over the permitted maximum weight is imposed in addition to the
normal permit fee. Miles must be calculated based on the distance already traveled in the state plus
the distance from the point of detection to a transportation loading site or unloading site within the
state or to the point of exit from the state.
   (f) As an alternative to paragraph (e), an annual permit may be issued for overweight, or oversize
and overweight, mobile cranes; construction equipment, machinery, and supplies; implements of
husbandry; and commercial boat hauling. The fees for the permit are as follows:
             Gross Weight (pounds) of Vehicle                           Annual Permit Fee
                         90,000 or less                                        $200

                       110,001 - 120,000                                       $500
                       120,001 - 130,000                                       $600

If the gross weight of the vehicle is more than 145,000 pounds the permit fee is determined under
paragraph (e).
    (g) For vehicles which exceed the width limitations set forth in section 169.80 by more than 72
inches, an additional cost equal to $120 added to the amount in paragraph (a) when the permit is
issued while seasonal load restrictions pursuant to section 169.87 are in effect.
    (h) $85 for an annual permit to be issued for a period not to exceed 12 months, for
refuse-compactor vehicles that carry a gross weight of not more than: 22,000 pounds on a single
rear axle; 38,000 pounds on a tandem rear axle; or, subject to section 169.828, subdivision 2,
46,000 pounds on a tridem rear axle. A permit issued for up to 46,000 pounds on a tridem rear axle
must limit the gross vehicle weight to not more than 62,000 pounds.
   (i) $300 for a motor vehicle described in section 169.8261. The fee under this paragraph must

and Soil Resources, shall submit recommendations to the house of representatives and senate
committees and divisions with primary jurisdiction over environment and natural resources policy

projects can best be streamlined through creation of a single point of issuance system. The
recommendations shall specifically:
    (1) outline a single point of issuance system in which road authorities applying for state water
permits would interact with a single state agency serving as the sole intermediary on behalf of all
state agencies with an interest in a road authority's water permit application;
    (2) provide a goal for the maximum number of days that the state believes are necessary to issue
final water permitting decisions;
  (3) identify how state entities with current oversight authority over water permitting decisions
would allocate resources to accommodate a single point of issuance system; and
    (4) suggest strategies to enhance the coordination of federal and state water permitting
information gathering and decision-making."

    Subd. 4. Law enforcement agency; disclosure of information to public. (a) The law
enforcement agency in the area where the predatory offender resides, expects to reside, is
employed, or is regularly found, shall disclose to the public any information regarding the offender
contained in the report forwarded to the agency under subdivision 3, paragraph (f), that is relevant
and necessary to protect the public and to counteract the offender's dangerousness, consistent with
the guidelines in paragraph (b). The extent of the information disclosed and the community to
whom disclosure is made must relate to the level of danger posed by the offender, to the offender's
pattern of offending behavior, and to the need of community members for information to enhance
their individual and collective safety.
    (b) The law enforcement agency shall employ the following guidelines in determining the scope
of disclosure made under this subdivision:
    (1) if the offender is assigned to risk level I, the agency may maintain information regarding
the offender within the agency and may disclose it to other law enforcement agencies. Additionally,
the agency may disclose the information to any victims of or witnesses to the offense committed
by the offender. The agency shall disclose the information to victims of the offense committed
by the offender who have requested disclosure and to adult members of the offender's immediate

household;
    (2) if the offender is assigned to risk level II, the agency also may disclose the information
to agencies and groups that the offender is likely to encounter for the purpose of securing those
institutions and protecting individuals in their care while they are on or near the premises of the
institution. These agencies and groups include the staff members of public and private educational
institutions, day care establishments, and establishments and organizations that primarily serve
individuals likely to be victimized by the offender. The agency also may disclose the information
to individuals the agency believes are likely to be victimized by the offender. The agency's belief
shall be based on the offender's pattern of offending or victim preference as documented in the
information provided by the department of corrections or human services;
    (3) if the offender is assigned to risk level III, the agency shall disclose the information to the
persons and entities described in clauses (1) and (2) and to other members of the community whom
the offender is likely to encounter, unless the law enforcement agency determines that public safety
would be compromised by the disclosure or that a more limited disclosure is necessary to protect
the identity of the victim.
    Except as provided in section 253B.185, subdivision 10a, paragraph (a), notwithstanding the
assignment of a predatory offender to risk level II or III, a law enforcement agency may not make
the disclosures permitted or required by clause (2) or (3), if: the offender is placed or resides in a
residential facility. However, if an offender is placed or resides in a residential facility, the offender
and the head of the facility shall designate the offender's likely residence upon release from the
facility and the head of the facility shall notify the commissioner of corrections or the commissioner
of human services of the offender's likely residence at least 14 days before the offender's scheduled
release date. The commissioner shall give this information to the law enforcement agency having
jurisdiction over the offender's likely residence. The head of the residential facility also shall notify
the commissioner of corrections or human services within 48 hours after finalizing the offender's
approved relocation plan to a permanent residence. Within five days after receiving this notification,
the appropriate commissioner shall give to the appropriate law enforcement agency all relevant
information the commissioner has concerning the offender, including information on the risk factors
in the offender's history and the risk level to which the offender was assigned. After receiving this
information, the law enforcement agency shall make the disclosures permitted or required by clause
(2) or (3), as appropriate.
   (c) As used in paragraph (b), clauses (2) and (3), "likely to encounter" means that:
   (1) the organizations or community members are in a location or in close proximity to a location
where the offender lives or is employed, or which the offender visits or is likely to visit on a regular
basis, other than the location of the offender's outpatient treatment program; and
    (2) the types of interaction which ordinarily occur at that location and other circumstances
indicate that contact with the offender is reasonably certain.
   (d) A law enforcement agency or official who discloses information under this subdivision shall

the family's income. Child care providers who accept third-party payments must maintain family
specific documentation of payment source, amount, and time period covered by the payment.

                     t­ The provider seeking authorization under this section shall collect the information
required under section 245C.05, subdivision 1, and forward the information to the county agency.
The background study must include a review of the information required under section 245C.08,
subdivisions 2, 3, and 4, paragraph (b). A nonlicensed family child care provider is not authorized
under this section if any household member who is the subject of a background study is determined to
have a disqualifying characteristic under paragraphs (b) to (e) or under section 245C.14 or 245C.15.
If a county has determined that a provider is able to be authorized in that county, and a family in
another county later selects that provider, the provider is able to be authorized in the second county
without undergoing a new background investigation unless one of the following conditions exists:
       (1) two years have passed since the first authorization;
       (2) another person age 13 or older has joined the provider's household since the last authorization;
       (3) a current household member has turned 13 since the last authorization; or
       (4) there is reason to believe that a household member has a factor that prevents authorization.

    Subd. 6. Record-keeping requirement. All providers receiving child care assistance payments
must keep daily attendance records for children receiving child care assistance and must make those
records available immediately to the county upon request. The attendance records must be completed
daily and include the date, the first and last name of each child in attendance, and the times when each
child is dropped off and picked up. To the extent possible, the times that the child was dropped off
to and picked up from the child care provider must be entered by the person dropping off or picking
up the child. The daily attendance records must be retained for six years after the date of service.
A county may deny authorization as a child care provider to any applicant or rescind authorization
of any provider when the county knows or has reason to believe that the provider has not complied
with the record-keeping requirement in this subdivision.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 119B.13, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Subsidy restrictions. (a) Beginning October 31, 2011, the maximum rate paid
for child care assistance in any county or multicounty region under the child care fund shall be the
rate for like-care arrangements in the county effective July 1, 2006, decreased by 2.5 percent.

                  r Biennially, beginning in 2012, the commissioner shall survey rates charged by
child care providers in Minnesota to determine the 75th percentile for like-care arrangements in
counties. When the commissioner determines that, using the commissioner's established protocol,
the number of providers responding to the survey is too small to determine the 75th percentile rate
for like-care arrangements in a county or multicounty region, the commissioner may establish the
75th percentile maximum rate based on like-care arrangements in a county, region, or category that
the commissioner deems to be similar.
    (c) A rate which includes a special needs rate paid under subdivision 3 or under a school readiness
service agreement paid under section 119B.231, may be in excess of the maximum rate allowed
under this subdivision.
    (d) The department shall monitor the effect of this paragraph on provider rates. The county
shall pay the provider's full charges for every child in care up to the maximum established. The
commissioner shall determine the maximum rate for each type of care on an hourly, full-day, and
weekly basis, including special needs and disability care. The maximum payment to a provider for
one day of care must not exceed the daily rate. The maximum payment to a provider for one week
of care must not exceed the weekly rate.
    (e) Child care providers receiving reimbursement under this chapter must not be paid activity
fees or an additional amount above the maximum rates for care provided during nonstandard hours
for families receiving assistance.
    (f) When the provider charge is greater than the maximum provider rate allowed, the parent is
responsible for payment of the difference in the rates in addition to any family co-payment fee.
    (g) All maximum provider rates changes shall be implemented on the Monday following the
effective date of the maximum provider rate.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 119B.13, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Provider payments. (a) The provider shall bill for services provided within ten days
of the end of the service period. If bills are submitted within ten days of the end of the service

period, payments under the child care fund shall be made within 30 days of receiving a bill from the
provider. Counties or the state may establish policies that make payments on a more frequent basis.
     (b) If a provider has received an authorization of care and been issued a billing form for an
eligible family, the bill must be submitted within 60 days of the last date of service on the bill. A
bill submitted more than 60 days after the last date of service must be paid if the county determines
that the provider has shown good cause why the bill was not submitted within 60 days. Good cause
must be defined in the county's child care fund plan under section 119B.08, subdivision 3, and the
definition of good cause must include county error. Any bill submitted more than a year after the
last date of service on the bill must not be paid.
    (c) If a provider provided care for a time period without receiving an authorization of care and a
billing form for an eligible family, payment of child care assistance may only be made retroactively
for a maximum of six months from the date the provider is issued an authorization of care and billing
form.
    (d) A county may refuse to issue a child care authorization to a licensed or legal nonlicensed
provider, revoke an existing child care authorization to a licensed or legal nonlicensed provider, stop
payment issued to a licensed or legal nonlicensed provider, or m ­­ay
                                                                    ­ refuse to pay a bill submitted by
a licensed or legal nonlicensed provider if:
   (1) the provider admits to intentionally giving the county materially false information on the
provider's billing forms; o
                          ­­r
   (2) a county finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the provider intentionally gave the
county materially false information on the provider's billing forms;
   (3) the provider is in violation of licensing or child care assistance program rules and the provider
has not corrected the violation;
    (4) the provider submits false attendance reports or refuses to provide documentation of the
child's attendance upon request; or
   (5) the provider gives false child care price information.
    (e) A county's payment policies must be included in the county's child care plan under section
119B.08, subdivision 3. If payments are made by the state, in addition to being in compliance with
this subdivision, the payments must be made in compliance with section 16A.124.
   Sec. 9. CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM RULE CHANGE.
    The commissioner shall amend Minnesota Rules, part 3400.0035, subpart 2, to remove the
requirement that applications must be submitted by mail or delivered to the agency within 15
calendar days after the date of signature. The commissioner shall comply with Minnesota Statutes,
section 14.389, in adopting the amendment.

    "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 122A.245, subdivision 1, is amended
to read:
   Subdivision 1. Requirements. (a) To improve academic excellence, improve ethnic and cultural
diversity in the classroom, and close the academic achievement gap, the Board of Teaching must
approve qualified teacher preparation programs under this section that are a means to acquire a
two-year limited-term license, which the board may renew one time for an additional one-year term,
and to prepare for acquiring a standard license. The following entities are eligible to participate
under this section:
   (1) a school district or charter school that forms a partnership with a college or university that
has a board-approved alternative teacher preparation program; or
   (2) a school district or charter school, after consulting with a college or university with a
board-approved teacher preparation program, forms a partnership with a nonprofit corporation
organized under chapter 317A for an education-related purpose that has a board-approved teacher
preparation program.
    (b) Before participating in this program, a candidate must:
    (1) have a bachelor's degree with a 3.0 or higher grade point average unless the board waives
the grade point average requirement based on board-adopted criteria;
   (2) pass the reading, writing, and mathematics skills examination under section 122A.09,
subdivision 4, paragraph (b); and
   (3) obtain qualifying scores on applicable board-approved rigorous content area and pedagogy
examinations under section 122A.09, subdivision 4, paragraph (e).
    (c) The Board of Teaching must issue a two-year limited-term license to a person who enrolls
in an alternative teacher preparation program. This limited-term license is not a provisional license
under section 122A.40 or section 122A.41.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.40, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
     Subd. 10. Negotiated unrequested leave of absence. (a) The school board and the exclusive
bargaining representative of the teachers may negotiate a plan providing for unrequested leave
of absence without pay or fringe benefits for as many teachers as may be necessary because of
discontinuance of position, lack of pupils, financial limitations, or merger of classes caused by
consolidation of districts. F­­

provisions of section 179A.16 do not apply for the purposes of this subdivision. Notwithstanding

licensure fields and evaluation outcomes, from the least to most effective category under subdivision

8 and from least to greatest seniority, including probationary teachers, within each category, which
if negotiated, must be consistent with subdivision 11, paragraph (n).
    (b) Notwithstanding other law to the contrary, if a school board fails to successfully negotiate a
plan under paragraph (a), the provisions of subdivision 11 apply unless a majority of school board
members formally decides to place teachers on unrequested leave of absence based on teachers'
subject matter licensure fields and evaluation outcomes, from the least to most effective category
under subdivision 8 and from least to greatest seniority, including probationary teachers, within each
effectiveness category; the decision must be consistent with subdivision 11, paragraph (n). In such
a case the board must develop, publish, and implement an unrequested leave of absence plan based
on teachers' subject matter licensure fields and evaluation outcomes, from the least to most effective
category under subdivision 8 and from least to greatest seniority, including probationary teachers,
within each effectiveness category, and subdivision 11, paragraphs (a) through (m), do not apply.
    (c) For purposes of placing a teacher on unrequested leave of absence or recalling a teacher
from unrequested leave of absence, nothing in this subdivision requires a school board to reassign a
teacher with more seniority to a different subject matter licensure field or to a substantially different
grade level assignment in order to accommodate the seniority claims of a teacher who is similarly
licensed and effective but with less seniority. For purposes of this subdivision, a teacher holding
a provisional license in a subject area includes a teacher who has received a waiver or variance
to teach that subject from the Minnesota Board of Teaching. "A substantially different grade level
assignment" means an assignment between kindergarten, grades 1 through 6, junior high school,
and senior high school.
   (d) Nothing in this subdivision permits a school board to use a teacher's remuneration as the
basis for making unrequested leave of absence or discharge decisions.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 122A.40, subdivision 11, is amended to read:
    Subd. 11. Unrequested leave of absence. The board may place on unrequested leave of absence,
without pay or fringe benefits, as many teachers as may be necessary because of discontinuance
of position, lack of pupils, financial limitations, or merger of classes caused by consolidation or
reorganization of districts under chapter 123A. The unrequested leave is effective at the close of
the school year. In placing teachers on unrequested leave, the board is governed by the following
provisions:
    (a) The board may place probationary teachers on unrequested leave first in the inverse order
of their employment. A teacher who has acquired continuing contract rights must not be placed on
unrequested leave of absence while probationary teachers are retained in positions for which the
teacher who has acquired continuing contract rights is licensed;
    (b) Teachers who have acquired continuing contract rights shall be placed on unrequested leave
of absence in fields in which they are licensed in the inverse order in which they were employed
by the school district. In the case of equal seniority, the order in which teachers who have acquired
continuing contract rights shall be placed on unrequested leave of absence in fields in which they
are licensed is negotiable;

of placement on leave of absence. A teacher must not be reinstated to a position in a field in which
the teacher holds only a provisional license, other than a vocational education license if required
for the position, while another teacher who holds a nonprovisional license in the same field remains

to most effective category under subdivision 8 and from least to greatest seniority, including
probationary teachers, within each effectiveness category. A school board is not required to reassign
a teacher with more seniority to a different subject matter licensure field or to a substantially
different grade level assignment in order to accommodate the seniority claims of a teacher who is
similarly licensed and effective but with less seniority. A school board may decide not to renew a
probationary teacher's contract as it sees fit. The school board must make available to the public
in a readily accessible format the unrequested leave of absence plan it develops and implements
under this paragraph.

(b), causes for the discharge or demotion of a teacher either during or after the probationary period
must be:
   (1) immoral character, conduct unbecoming a teacher, or insubordination;
   (2) failure without justifiable cause to teach without first securing the written release of the school
board having the care, management, or control of the school in which the teacher is employed;
   (3) inefficiency in teaching or in the management of a school, consistent with subdivision 5,
paragraph (b);
    (4) affliction with active tuberculosis or other communicable disease must be considered as cause
for removal or suspension while the teacher is suffering from such disability; or
   (5) discontinuance of position or lack of pupils.

    Notwithstanding other law to the contrary, the school board and the exclusive representative
of the teachers may negotiate an agreement to discharge or demote teachers under clause (5)
based on their subject matter licensure fields and evaluation outcomes, from the least to most
effective category under subdivision 5 and from least to greatest seniority, including probationary
teachers, within each effectiveness category. Alternatively, the majority of the school board
members may formally decide to discharge or demote teachers under clause (5) based on their
subject matter licensure fields and evaluation outcomes, from the least to most effective category
under subdivision 5 and from least to greatest seniority, including probationary teachers, within
each effectiveness category; in this case the board must develop and implement a discharge and
demotion plan based on teachers' subject matter licensure fields and evaluation outcomes, from
the least to most effective category and from least to greatest seniority, including probationary
teachers, within each effectiveness category. Beginning in the 2016-2017 school year and later, and
notwithstanding any contradictory provisions in this subdivision, the school board must discharge
or demote teachers under clause (5) based on their subject matter licensure fields and most recent
evaluation outcomes, from the least to most effective category under subdivision 5 and from least
to greatest seniority, including probationary teachers, within each effectiveness category. Nothing
in this subdivision permits a school board to use a teacher's remuneration as the basis for making
discharge or demotion decisions. The school board must make available to the public in a readily
accessible format any discharge and demotion plan it develops to implement clause (5) of this
paragraph.
   For purposes of this paragraph, conduct unbecoming a teacher includes an unfair discriminatory
practice described in section 363A.13.
    (b) A probationary or continuing-contract teacher must be discharged immediately upon receipt
of notice under section 122A.20, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), that the teacher's license has been
revoked due to a conviction for child abuse or sexual abuse.

when that exercise results in that teacher being retained by the district in a field for which the teacher
holds only a provisional license, as defined by the Board of Teaching, unless that exercise of seniority
results in the termination of services, on account of discontinuance of position or lack of pupils, of

under this subdivision, nothing in this subdivision requires a school board to reassign a teacher with
more seniority to a different subject matter licensure field or to a substantially different grade level

each teacher employed by an affected district shall be assigned to the newly created or enlarged
district on the basis of a ratio of the pupils assigned to each district according to the new district
boundaries. The district receiving the greatest number of pupils must be assigned the teacher with
the greatest seniority, and the remaining teachers must be alternately assigned to each district until
the district receiving the fewest pupils has received its ratio of teachers who will not be retiring
before the effective date of the consolidation or dissolution.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), the board and the exclusive representative of teachers in
each district involved in the consolidation or dissolution and attachment may negotiate a plan for
assigning teachers to each newly created or enlarged district.

a person must be a resident of this state.
   (b) A "resident" is a person living in the state for at least 60 days with the intention of making the
person's home here and not for any temporary purpose. Time spent in a shelter for battered women
shall count toward satisfying the 60-day residency requirement. All applicants for this program are
required to demonstrate the requisite intent and may do so in any of the following ways:
    (1) by showing that the applicant maintains a residence at a verified address, other than a place
of public accommodation. An applicant may verify a residence address by presenting a valid state
driver's license, a state identification card, a voter registration card, or a rent receipt; or
   (2) by verifying residence according to Minnesota Rules, part 9500.1219, subpart 3, item C.

established.
   (d) For purposes of eligibility for emergency general assistance, the 60-day residency
requirement under this section may be waived.

unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain
valid and shall be given full effect.
