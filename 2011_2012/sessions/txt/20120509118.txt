    (b) If an individual is an owner or partial owner of a business entity, the individual is an employee
of the person for whom the individual is performing services in the course of the person's trade,
business, profession, or occupation, and is not an employee of the business entity in which the

   (1) the business entity meets the nine factors in paragraph (a);
   (2) invoices are submitted in the name of the business entity;
   (3) the business entity is registered with the secretary of state, if required; and

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 181.723, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4a. Registration pilot project. (a) The commissioner shall implement a pilot project,
effective July 1, 2012, for the registration of persons who perform public or private sector
commercial or residential building construction or improvement services as described in
subdivision 2. The purpose of the pilot project is to evaluate whether the information obtained
through registration assists the Department of Labor and Industry, the Department of Employment
and Economic Development, and the Department of Revenue to enforce laws related to
misclassification of employees. The commissioner shall issue a report to the legislature no later
than January 1, 2014, on recommendations for amendments to the registration program, including
reasonable registration fees to be used to aid in enforcing misclassification laws. The commissioner
must not charge a fee for registration under the pilot project, but may take the enforcement action
specified in subdivision 8a. The pilot project shall expire on June 30, 2014, unless extended by the
legislature.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c), any person who performs construction services in the
state on or after September 15, 2012, must register with the commissioner as provided in subdivision
5 before performing construction services for another person. The requirements for registration
under this subdivision are not a substitute for, and do not relieve a person from complying with, any
other law requiring that the person be licensed, registered, or certified.
   (c) The registration requirements in this subdivision do not apply to:
    (1) a person who, at the time the person is performing the construction services, holds a current
license, certificate, or registration under chapter 299M or 326B;
    (2) a person who holds a current independent contractor exemption certificate issued under this
section that is in effect on September 15, 2012, except that the person must register under this section
no later than the date the exemption certificate expires, is revoked, or is canceled;
   (3) a person who has given a bond to the state under section 326B.197 or 326B.46;
   (4) an employee of the person performing the construction services, if the person was in
compliance with laws related to employment of the individual at the time the construction services
were performed;
   (5) an architect or professional engineer engaging in professional practice as defined in section
326.02, subdivisions 2 and 3;

    (6) a school district or technical college governed under chapter 136F;
    (7) a person providing construction services on a volunteer basis, including but not limited
to Habitat for Humanity and Builders Outreach Foundation, and their individual volunteers when
engaged in activities on their behalf; or
    (8) a person exempt from licensing under section 326B.805, subdivision 6, clause (5).

    Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.31, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Withholding tax, withholding from payments to out-of-state contractors, and
withholding by partnerships and small business corporations. (a) Except as provided in
paragraph (b), an employer or person withholding tax under section 290.92 or 290.923, subdivision
2, who fails to pay to or deposit with the commissioner a sum or sums required by those sections
to be deducted, withheld, and paid, is personally and individually liable to the state for the sum
or sums, and added penalties and interest, and is not liable to another person for that payment or
payments. The sum or sums deducted and withheld under section 290.92, subdivision 2a or 3, or
290.923, subdivision 2, must be held as a special fund in trust for the state of Minnesota.
    (b) If the employer or person withholding tax under section 290.92 or 290.923, subdivision 2,
fails to deduct and withhold the tax in violation of those sections, and later the taxes against which
the tax may be credited are paid, the tax required to be deducted and withheld will not be collected
from the employer. This does not, however, relieve the employer from liability for any penalties and
interest otherwise applicable for failure to deduct and withhold. This paragraph does not apply to
an employer subject to paragraph (g), ­o­­ t­ ­

The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
Dear Madam President:
   I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 291, Senate File 1755, a bill relating to state employee
layoffs.
   Section 1 of this bill would fundamentally change collective bargaining by allowing the
Legislature to participate in the negotiation process and mediation efforts. The Legislature's
involvement at those stages would disrupt the long-established process between the Executive
Branch and its employees.
    Section 2 of the bill would interfere with the day-to-day flexibility needed by the Executive
Branch to manage most effectively and efficiently. Labor contracts between the Executive Branch
and its employees are two years in duration. A Memorandum of Understanding is a tool used by the
Executive Branch to address issues, which were not contemplated when the contract was negotiated,
but which have arisen during that two year time frame. This process has worked well in the past,
and I am not aware of any legislative attempts to change it during the eight years my predecessor
was in this office.
   Section 3 of this bill would allow appointing authorities to implement unpaid leave and
reductions in hours, instead of imposing layoffs at the time of state employee contract negotiations.
However, Minnesota law already authorizes appointing authorities to take those actions; thus
Section 3 of the bill is redundant.
    Minnesota's collective bargaining system is based upon an appropriate separation of powers. It
assigns to the Executive Branch the authority to manage its employees, including the negotiating
of collective bargaining agreements. The Legislature, as set forth in Chapter 179A, approves or
disapproves those agreements, once they are negotiated. This system has worked well for many
years. I see no compelling reasons to change it so drastically.
   For those reasons, I am vetoing this bill.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Mark Dayton, Governor
   Senator Senjem moved that S.F. No. 1755 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

The Honorable Michelle L. Fischbach
President of the Senate
    We, the undersigned conferees for H. F. No. 247 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
    That the Senate recede from its amendments and that H. F. No. 247 be further amended as

       DEPARTMENT POLICY AND TECHNICAL: INCOME AND CORPORATE
                          FRANCHISE TAXES
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.02, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 9. Field audit. "Field audit" means the physical presence of examiners in the taxpayer's
or taxpayer's representative's office conducting an examination of the taxpayer with the intention
of issuing an assessment or notice of change in tax or which results in the issuing of an assessment
or notice of change in tax. The examination may include inspecting a taxpayer's place of business,
tangible personal property, equipment, computer systems and facilities, pertinent books, records,
papers, vouchers, computer printouts, accounts, and documents.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
118TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 9, 2012                                           7419

   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.26, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. Short taxable year. (a) A corporation or an entity with a short taxable year of less than
12 months, but at least four months, must pay estimated tax in equal installments on or before the
15th day of the third, sixth, ninth, and final month of the short taxable year, to the extent applicable
based on the number of months in the short taxable year.
   (b) A corporation or an entity is not required to make estimated tax payments for a short taxable
year unless its tax liability before the first day of the last month of the taxable year can reasonably
be expected to exceed $500.
   (c) No payment is required for a short taxable year of less than four months.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.26, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Underpayment of estimated tax. If there is an underpayment of estimated tax by a
corporation or an entity, there shall be added to the tax for the taxable year an amount determined
at the rate in section 270C.40 on the amount of the underpayment, determined under subdivision
5, for the period of the underpayment determined under subdivision 6. This subdivision does not
apply in the first taxable year that a corporation is subject to the tax imposed under section 290.02
or an entity is subject to the tax imposed under section 290.05, subdivision 3.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.26, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
  Subd. 7. Required installments. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the
amount of a required installment is 25 percent of the required annual payment.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the term "required annual payment" means
the lesser of:
   (1) 100 percent of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year, or, if no return is filed, 100
percent of the tax for that year; or
    (2) 100 percent of the tax shown on the return of the corporation or entity for the preceding
taxable year provided the return was for a full 12-month period, showed a liability, and was filed by
the corporation or entity.
    (c) Except for determining the first required installment for any taxable year, paragraph (b),
clause (2), does not apply in the case of a large corporation. The term "large corporation" means
a corporation or any predecessor corporation that had taxable net income of $1,000,000 or more
for any taxable year during the testing period. The term "testing period" means the three taxable
years immediately preceding the taxable year involved. A reduction allowed to a large corporation
for the first installment that is allowed by applying paragraph (b), clause (2), must be recaptured by
increasing the next required installment by the amount of the reduction.
    (d) In the case of a required installment, if the corporation or entity establishes that the annualized
income installment is less than the amount determined in paragraph (a), the amount of the required
installment is the annualized income installment and the recapture of previous quarters' reductions

allowed by this paragraph must be recovered by increasing later required installments to the extent
the reductions have not previously been recovered.
   (e) The "annualized income installment" is the excess, if any, of:
    (1) an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the tax for the taxable year computed by
placing on an annualized basis the taxable income:
   (i) for the first two months of the taxable year, in the case of the first required installment;
   (ii) for the first two months or for the first five months of the taxable year, in the case of the
second required installment;
    (iii) for the first six months or for the first eight months of the taxable year, in the case of the
third required installment; and
   (iv) for the first nine months or for the first 11 months of the taxable year, in the case of the
fourth required installment, over
   (2) the aggregate amount of any prior required installments for the taxable year.
    (3) For the purpose of this paragraph, the annualized income shall be computed by placing on
an annualized basis the taxable income for the year up to the end of the month preceding the due
date for the quarterly payment multiplied by 12 and dividing the resulting amount by the number of
months in the taxable year (2, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 11 as the case may be) referred to in clause (1).
   (4) The "applicable percentage" used in clause (1) is:
        For the following                                 The applicable
        required installments:                            percentage is:
                 1st                                               25

    (f)(1) If this paragraph applies, the amount determined for any installment must be determined
in the following manner:
   (i) take the taxable income for the months during the taxable year preceding the filing month;
   (ii) divide that amount by the base period percentage for the months during the taxable year
preceding the filing month;
   (iii) determine the tax on the amount determined under item (ii); and
   (iv) multiply the tax computed under item (iii) by the base period percentage for the filing month
and the months during the taxable year preceding the filing month.
   (2) For purposes of this paragraph:
   (i) the "base period percentage" for a period of months is the average percent that the taxable
118TH DAY]                             WEDNESDAY, MAY 9, 2012                                                7421

income for the corresponding months in each of the three preceding taxable years bears to the taxable
income for the three preceding taxable years;
    (ii) the term "filing month" means the month in which the installment is required to be paid;
    (iii) this paragraph only applies if the base period percentage for any six consecutive months of
the taxable year equals or exceeds 70 percent; and
    (iv) the commissioner may provide by rule for the determination of the base period percentage
in the case of reorganizations, new corporations or entities, and other similar circumstances.
    (3) In the case of a required installment determined under this paragraph, if the corporation
or entity determines that the installment is less than the amount determined in paragraph (a), the
amount of the required installment is the amount determined under this paragraph and the recapture
of previous quarters' reductions allowed by this paragraph must be recovered by increasing later
required installments to the extent the reductions have not previously been recovered.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.26, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Failure to file an estimate. In the case of a corporation or an entity that fails to file
an estimated tax for a taxable year when one is required, the period of the underpayment runs from
the four installment dates in subdivision 2 or 3, whichever applies, to the earlier of the periods in
subdivision 6, clauses (1) and (2).
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.38, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Federal tax changes. If the amount of income, items of tax preference, deductions,
or credits for any year of a taxpayer, or the wages paid by a taxpayer for any period, as reported
to the Internal Revenue Service is changed or corrected by the commissioner of Internal Revenue
or other officer of the United States or other competent authority, or where a renegotiation of a
contract or subcontract with the United States results in a change in income, items of tax preference,
deductions, credits, or withholding tax, or, in the case of estate tax, where there are adjustments
to the taxable estate, the taxpayer shall report the change or correction or renegotiation results in
writing to the commissioner of revenue. The report must be ­        su

the commissioner may recompute and reassess the tax due, including a refund (1) within one year
after the report or amended return is filed with the commissioner, notwithstanding any period of
limitations to the contrary, or (2) within any other applicable period stated in this section, whichever
period is longer. The period provided for the carryback of any amount of loss or credit is also
extended as provided in this subdivision, notwithstanding any law to the contrary.
    (b) If a taxpayer fails to submit the report or file the amended return as required by subdivision
7, the commissioner may recompute the tax, including a refund, based on information available to
the commissioner. The tax may be recomputed within six years after the time period provided by
subdivision 8, notwithstanding any period of limitations to the contrary.
    (c) If the commissioner has completed a field audit of the taxpayer, and, but for this subdivision,
the commissioner's time period to adjust the tax has expired, the additional tax due or refund is
limited to only those changes that are required to be made to the return which relate to the changes
made on the federal return. This subdivision does not apply to sales and use tax.

    (2) for six months following the expiration of the extended federal period of limitations when no
change is made by the federal authority. If no change is made by the federal authority, and, but for this

has completed a field audit of the taxpayer, no additional changes resulting in additional tax due or
a refund may be made. F      ­o

from state income tax under the laws of the United States;
    (2) if included in federal taxable income, the amount of any overpayment of income tax to
Minnesota or to any other state, for any previous taxable year, whether the amount is received as a
refund or as a credit to another taxable year's income tax liability;
    (3) the amount paid to others, less the amount used to claim the credit allowed under section
290.0674, not to exceed $1,625 for each qualifying child in grades kindergarten to 6 and $2,500

    Subd. 3. Alternative minimum taxable income. "Alternative minimum taxable income" is

and tax preference items in sections 56, 57, 58, and 59(d), (e), (f), and (h) of the Internal Revenue
Code. If a corporation files a separate company Minnesota tax return, the minimum tax must be
computed on a separate company basis. If a corporation is part of a tax group filing a unitary return,
the minimum tax must be computed on a unitary basis. The following adjustments must be made.
    (1) For purposes of the depreciation adjustments under section 56(a)(1) and 56(g)(4)(A) of
the Internal Revenue Code, the basis for depreciable property placed in service in a taxable year
beginning before January 1, 1990, is the adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes, including
any modification made in a taxable year under section 290.01, subdivision 19e, or Minnesota
Statutes 1986, section 290.09, subdivision 7, paragraph (c).
   For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, the amount of any remaining modification
made under section 290.01, subdivision 19e, or Minnesota Statutes 1986, section 290.09,
subdivision 7, paragraph (c), not previously deducted is a depreciation allowance in the first taxable
year after December 31, 2000.
    (2) The portion of the depreciation deduction allowed for federal income tax purposes under
section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code that is required as an addition under section 290.01,
subdivision 19c, clause ­
                        (1
                         ­5­­
                            ) (14), is disallowed in determining alternative minimum taxable income.
   (3) The subtraction for depreciation allowed under section 290.01, subdivision 19d, clause ­
                                                                                              (1
                                                                                               ­­7­
                                                                                                  )
(16), is allowed as a depreciation deduction in determining alternative minimum taxable income.
    (4) The alternative tax net operating loss deduction under sections 56(a)(4) and 56(d) of the
Internal Revenue Code does not apply.
   (5) The special rule for certain dividends under section 56(g)(4)(C)(ii) of the Internal Revenue
Code does not apply.

    Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290.17, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Unitary business principle. (a) If a trade or business conducted wholly within this
state or partly within and partly without this state is part of a unitary business, the entire income
of the unitary business is subject to apportionment pursuant to section 290.191. Notwithstanding
subdivision 2, paragraph (c), none of the income of a unitary business is considered to be derived
from any particular source and none may be allocated to a particular place except as provided by
the applicable apportionment formula. The provisions of this subdivision do not apply to business
income subject to subdivision 5, income of an insurance company, or income of an investment
company determined under section 290.36.
    (b) The term "unitary business" means business activities or operations which result in a flow of
value between them. The term may be applied within a single legal entity or between multiple entities
and without regard to whether each entity is a sole proprietorship, a corporation, a partnership or a
trust.
    (c) Unity is presumed whenever there is unity of ownership, operation, and use, evidenced by
centralized management or executive force, centralized purchasing, advertising, accounting, or other
controlled interaction, but the absence of these centralized activities will not necessarily evidence
a nonunitary business. Unity is also presumed when business activities or operations are of mutual
benefit, dependent upon or contributory to one another, either individually or as a group.
    (d) Where a business operation conducted in Minnesota is owned by a business entity that carries
on business activity outside the state different in kind from that conducted within this state, and the
other business is conducted entirely outside the state, it is presumed that the two business operations
are unitary in nature, interrelated, connected, and interdependent unless it can be shown to the
contrary.

    (f) The net income and apportionment factors under section 290.191 or 290.20 of foreign
corporations and other foreign entities which are part of a unitary business shall not be included
in the net income or the apportionment factors of the unitary business. A foreign corporation or
other foreign entity which is required to file a return under this chapter shall file on a separate
return basis. The net income and apportionment factors under section 290.191 or 290.20 of foreign
operating corporations shall not be included in the net income or the apportionment factors of the
unitary business except as provided in paragraph (g).
    (g) The adjusted net income of a foreign operating corporation shall be deemed to be paid as
a dividend on the last day of its taxable year to each shareholder thereof, in proportion to each
shareholder's ownership, with which such corporation is engaged in a unitary business. Such deemed
dividend shall be treated as a dividend under section 290.21, subdivision 4.
7434                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [118TH DAY

    Dividends actually paid by a foreign operating corporation to a corporate shareholder which is a
member of the same unitary business as the foreign operating corporation shall be eliminated from
the net income of the unitary business in preparing a combined report for the unitary business. The
adjusted net income of a foreign operating corporation shall be its net income adjusted as follows:
    (1) any taxes paid or accrued to a foreign country, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a United
States possession or political subdivision of any of the foregoing shall be a deduction; and
    (2) the subtraction from federal taxable income for payments received from foreign corporations
or foreign operating corporations under section 290.01, subdivision 19d, clause (10), shall not be
allowed.
   If a foreign operating corporation incurs a net loss, neither income nor deduction from that
corporation shall be included in determining the net income of the unitary business.
    (h) For purposes of determining the net income of a unitary business and the factors to be used in
the apportionment of net income pursuant to section 290.191 or 290.20, there must be included only
the income and apportionment factors of domestic corporations or other domestic entities other than
foreign operating corporations that are determined to be part of the unitary business pursuant to this
subdivision, notwithstanding that foreign corporations or other foreign entities might be included in
the unitary business.
    (i) Deductions for expenses, interest, or taxes otherwise allowable under this chapter that are
connected with or allocable against dividends, deemed dividends described in paragraph (g), or
royalties, fees, or other like income described in section 290.01, subdivision 19d, clause (10), shall
not be disallowed.
    (j) Each corporation or other entity, except a sole proprietorship, that is part of a unitary business
must file combined reports as the commissioner determines. On the reports, all intercompany
transactions between entities included pursuant to paragraph (h) must be eliminated and the entire
net income of the unitary business determined in accordance with this subdivision is apportioned
among the entities by using each entity's Minnesota factors for apportionment purposes in the
numerators of the apportionment formula and the total factors for apportionment purposes of all
entities included pursuant to paragraph (h) in the denominators of the apportionment formula.
   (k) If a corporation has been divested from a unitary business and is included in a combined
report for a fractional part of the common accounting period of the combined report:
    (1) its income includable in the combined report is its income incurred for that part of the year
determined by proration or separate accounting; and
   (2) its sales, property, and payroll included in the apportionment formula must be prorated or
accounted for separately.

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 270.41, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Prohibited activity. A licensed assessor or other person employed by an assessment
jurisdiction or contracting with an assessment jurisdiction for the purpose of valuing or classifying
property for property tax purposes is prohibited from making appraisals or analyses, accepting an
appraisal assignment, or preparing an appraisal report as defined in section 82B.021, subdivisions
2, 4, 6, and 7, on any property within the assessment jurisdiction where the individual is employed
or performing the duties of the assessor under contract. Violation of this prohibition shall result in
immediate revocation of the individual's license to assess property for property tax purposes. This
prohibition must not be construed to prohibit an individual from carrying out any duties required
for the proper assessment of property for property tax purposes or performing duties enumerated in
section 273.061, subdivision 7 or 8. If a formal resolution has been adopted by the governing body of
a governmental unit, which specifies the purposes for which such work will be done, this prohibition
does not apply to appraisal activities undertaken on behalf of and at the request of the governmental
unit that has employed or contracted with the individual. The resolution may only allow appraisal
activities which are related to condemnations, right-of-way acquisitions, land exchanges, or special
assessments.

interest that is imposed by a law administered by the commissioner, or imposed by section 270.0725,
subdivision 1 or 2, or 270.075, as a result of the late payment of tax or late filing of a return, or any
part of an additional tax charge under section 289A.25, subdivision 2, or 289A.26, subdivision 4,
if the failure to timely pay the tax or failure to timely file the return is due to reasonable cause, or
if the taxpayer is located in a presidentially declared disaster or in a presidentially declared state of
emergency area or in an area declared to be in a state of emergency by the governor under section
12.31.
   (b) The commissioner shall abate any part of a penalty or additional tax charge under section
289A.25, subdivision 2, or 289A.26, subdivision 4, attributable to erroneous advice given to the
taxpayer in writing by an employee of the department acting in an official capacity, if the advice:

property which is exempt from ad valorem taxes, and taxes in lieu thereof, is leased, loaned, or
otherwise made available and used by a private individual, association, or corporation in connection
with a business conducted for profit, there shall be imposed a tax, for the privilege of so using or
possessing such real or personal property, in the same amount and to the same extent as though the
lessee or user was the owner of such property.
      (b) The tax imposed by this subdivision shall not apply to:
   (1) property leased or used as a concession in or relative to the use in whole or part of a public
park, market, fairgrounds, port authority, economic development authority established under chapter
469, municipal auditorium, municipal parking facility, municipal museum, or municipal stadium;
      (2) property of an airport owned by a city, town, county, or group thereof which is:
      (i) leased to or used by any person or entity including a fixed base operator; and
    (ii) used as a hangar for the storage or repair of aircraft or to provide aviation goods, services,
or facilities to the airport or general public;
the exception from taxation provided in this clause does not apply to:
    (i) property located at an airport owned or operated by the Metropolitan Airports Commission
or by a city of over 50,000 population according to the most recent federal census or such a city's
airport authority; or
   (ii) hangars leased by a private individual, association, or corporation in connection with a

   (5) property leased, loaned, or otherwise made available to a private individual, corporation, or
association under a cooperative farming agreement made pursuant to section 97A.135; or
   (6) property leased, loaned, or otherwise made available to a private individual, corporation, or
association under section 272.68, subdivision 4.

    (c) Taxes imposed by this subdivision are payable as in the case of personal property taxes
and shall be assessed to the lessees or users of real or personal property in the same manner as
taxes assessed to owners of real or personal property, except that such taxes shall not become a
lien against the property. When due, the taxes shall constitute a debt due from the lessee or user to
the state, township, city, county, and school district for which the taxes were assessed and shall be
collected in the same manner as personal property taxes. If property subject to the tax imposed by
this subdivision is leased or used jointly by two or more persons, each lessee or user shall be jointly
and severally liable for payment of the tax.
   (d) The tax on real property of the federal government, the state or any of its political
subdivisions that is leased by a private individual, association, or corporation and becomes taxable
under this subdivision or other provision of law must be assessed and collected as a personal
property assessment. The taxes do not become a lien against the real property.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 273.114, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Additional taxes. (a) When real property which is being, or has been valued and
assessed under this section is sold, transferred, or no longer qualifies under subdivision 2, the portion
sold, transferred, or no longer qualifying shall be subject to additional taxes in the amount equal
to the difference between the taxes determined in accordance with subdivision 3 and the amount
determined under subdivision 4, provided that the amount determined under subdivision 4 shall not
be greater than it would have been had the actual bona fide sale price of the real property at an
arm's-length transaction been used in lieu of the market value determined under subdivision 4. The
additional taxes shall be extended against the property on the tax list for taxes payable in the current
year, provided that no interest or penalties shall be levied on the additional taxes if timely paid and
provided that the additional taxes shall only be levied with respect to the current year plus two prior
years that the property has been valued and assessed under this section.
    (b) In the case of a sale or transfer, the additional taxes under paragraph (a) shall not be extended
against the property if the new owner submits a successful application by the later of May 1 of the
current year or 30 days after the sale or transfer.
   (c) For the purposes of this section, the following events do not constitute a sale or transfer for
property that qualified under subdivision 2 prior to the event:
   (1) death of a property owner when the surviving owners retain ownership of the property;
   (2) divorce of a married couple when one of the spouses retains ownership of the property;

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.124, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
   Subd. 13. Homestead application. (a) A person who meets the homestead requirements
under subdivision 1 must file a homestead application with the county assessor to initially obtain
homestead classification.
    (b) The format and contents of a uniform homestead application shall be prescribed by the
commissioner of revenue. The application must clearly inform the taxpayer that this application
must be signed by all owners who occupy the property or by the qualifying relative and returned to
the county assessor in order for the property to receive homestead treatment.
    (c) Every property owner applying for homestead classification must furnish to the county
assessor the Social Security number of each occupant who is listed as an owner of the property
on the deed of record, the name and address of each owner who does not occupy the property,
and the name and Social Security number of each owner's spouse who occupies the property.
The application must be signed by each owner who occupies the property and by each owner's
spouse who occupies the property, or, in the case of property that qualifies as a homestead under
subdivision 1, paragraph (c), by the qualifying relative.
    If a property owner occupies a homestead, the property owner's spouse may not claim another
property as a homestead unless the property owner and the property owner's spouse file with the
assessor an affidavit or other proof required by the assessor stating that the property qualifies as a
homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (e).
    Owners or spouses occupying residences owned by their spouses and previously occupied with
the other spouse, either of whom fail to include the other spouse's name and Social Security number
on the homestead application or provide the affidavits or other proof requested, will be deemed
to have elected to receive only partial homestead treatment of their residence. The remainder of
the residence will be classified as nonhomestead residential. When an owner or spouse's name and
Social Security number appear on homestead applications for two separate residences and only one
application is signed, the owner or spouse will be deemed to have elected to homestead the residence
for which the application was signed.
    The Social Security numbers, state or federal tax returns or tax return information, including the
federal income tax schedule F, required by this section, ­ or section 273.13, and affidavits or other
proofs of the property owners and spouses submitted under this or another section to support a claim
for a property tax homestead classification or other classification or benefit under section 273.13,
are private data on individuals as defined by section 13.02, subdivision 12, or nonpublic data as
defined in section 13.02, subdivision 9, but, notwithstanding that section, the private and nonpublic
data may be disclosed to the commissioner of revenue, or, for purposes of proceeding under the
Revenue Recapture Act to recover personal property taxes owing, to the county treasurer.
    (d) If residential real estate is occupied and used for purposes of a homestead by a relative
of the owner and qualifies for a homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (c), in order for the
property to receive homestead status, a homestead application must be filed with the assessor. The
Social Security number of each relative and spouse of a relative occupying the property shall be
required on the homestead application filed under this subdivision. If a different relative of the
owner subsequently occupies the property, the owner of the property must notify the assessor within

30 days of the change in occupancy. The Social Security number of a relative or relative's spouse
occupying the property is private data on individuals as defined by section 13.02, subdivision 12,
but may be disclosed to the commissioner of revenue, or, for the purposes of proceeding under the
Revenue Recapture Act to recover personal property taxes owing, to the county treasurer.
    (e) The homestead application shall also notify the property owners that ­h        t­­

                                                             t if the property is granted homestead status
for any assessment year, that same property shall remain classified as homestead until the property
is sold or transferred to another person, or the owners, the spouse of the owner, or the relatives no
longer use the property as their homestead. Upon the sale or transfer of the homestead property, a
certificate of value must be timely filed with the county auditor as provided under section 272.115.
Failure to notify the assessor within 30 days that the property has been sold, transferred, or that the
owner, the spouse of the owner, or the relative is no longer occupying the property as a homestead,
shall result in the penalty provided under this subdivision and the property will lose its current
homestead status.

has not been filed with the county by December 15, the assessor shall classify the property as
nonhomestead for the current assessment year for taxes payable in the following year, provided
that the owner may be entitled to receive the homestead classification by proper application under
section 375.192.
    Subd. 13a. Occupant list. ­ (g
                                 ­­) At the request of the commissioner, each county must give
the commissioner a list that includes the name and Social Security number of each occupant of
homestead property who is the property owner, property owner's spouse, qualifying relative of a
property owner, or a spouse of a qualifying relative. The commissioner shall use the information
provided on the lists as appropriate under the law, including for the detection of improper claims
by owners, or relatives of owners, under chapter 290A.
    Subd. 13b. Improper homestead. ­   (h
                                        ­­) (a) If the commissioner finds that a property owner may
be claiming a fraudulent homestead, the commissioner shall notify the appropriate counties. Within
90 days of the notification, the county assessor shall investigate to determine if the homestead
classification was properly claimed. If the property owner does not qualify, the county assessor
shall notify the county auditor who will determine the amount of homestead benefits that had been
improperly allowed. For the purpose of this ­  s­   t­o

                                                 e­   ­­n subdivision, "homestead benefits" means the
tax reduction resulting from the classification as a homestead under section 273.13, the taconite
homestead credit under section 273.135, the residential homestead and agricultural homestead
credits under section 273.1384, and the supplemental homestead credit under section 273.1391.
    The county auditor shall send a notice to the person who owned the affected property at the time
the homestead application related to the improper homestead was filed, demanding reimbursement
of the homestead benefits plus a penalty equal to 100 percent of the homestead benefits. The person
notified may appeal the county's determination by serving copies of a petition for review with county
officials as provided in section 278.01 and filing proof of service as provided in section 278.01 with
the Minnesota Tax Court within 60 days of the date of the notice from the county. Procedurally,
the appeal is governed by the provisions in chapter 271 which apply to the appeal of a property
tax assessment or levy, but without requiring any prepayment of the amount in controversy. If the
7440                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [118TH DAY

amount of homestead benefits and penalty is not paid within 60 days, and if no appeal has been
filed, the county auditor shall certify the amount of taxes and penalty to the county treasurer. The
county treasurer will add interest to the unpaid homestead benefits and penalty amounts at the rate
provided in section 279.03 for real property taxes becoming delinquent in the calendar year during
which the amount remains unpaid. Interest may be assessed for the period beginning 60 days after
demand for payment was made.
    If the person notified is the current owner of the property, the treasurer may add the total amount
of homestead benefits, penalty, interest, and costs to the ad valorem taxes otherwise payable on the
property by including the amounts on the property tax statements under section 276.04, subdivision
3. The amounts added under this paragraph to the ad valorem taxes shall include interest accrued
through December 31 of the year preceding the taxes payable year for which the amounts are first
added. These amounts, when added to the property tax statement, become subject to all the laws for
the enforcement of real or personal property taxes for that year, and for any subsequent year.
    If the person notified is not the current owner of the property, the treasurer may collect the
amounts due under the Revenue Recapture Act in chapter 270A, or use any of the powers granted
in sections 277.20 and 277.21 without exclusion, to enforce payment of the homestead benefits,
penalty, interest, and costs, as if those amounts were delinquent tax obligations of the person who
owned the property at the time the application related to the improperly allowed homestead was
filed. The treasurer may relieve a prior owner of personal liability for the homestead benefits, penalty,
interest, and costs, and instead extend those amounts on the tax lists against the property as provided
in this paragraph to the extent that the current owner agrees in writing. On all demands, billings,
property tax statements, and related correspondence, the county must list and state separately the
amounts of homestead benefits, penalty, interest and costs being demanded, billed or assessed.
    ­
    (­)
     i­ (b) Any amount of homestead benefits recovered by the county from the property owner
shall be distributed to the county, city or town, and school district where the property is located
in the same proportion that each taxing district's levy was to the total of the three taxing districts'
levy for the current year. Any amount recovered attributable to taconite homestead credit shall be
transmitted to the St. Louis County auditor to be deposited in the taconite property tax relief account.
Any amount recovered that is attributable to supplemental homestead credit is to be transmitted to
the commissioner of revenue for deposit in the general fund of the state treasury. The total amount
of penalty collected must be deposited in the county general fund.
    ­j­ (c) If a property owner has applied for more than one homestead and the county assessors
    (­)
cannot determine which property should be classified as homestead, the county assessors will refer
the information to the commissioner. The commissioner shall make the determination and notify
the counties within 60 days.
    Subd. 13c. Property lists. ­ (k
                                  ­­) In addition to lists of homestead properties, the commissioner may
ask the counties to furnish lists of all properties and the record owners. The Social Security numbers
and federal identification numbers that are maintained by a county or city assessor for property tax
administration purposes, and that may appear on the lists retain their classification as private or
nonpublic data; but may be viewed, accessed, and used by the county auditor or treasurer of the
same county for the limited purpose of assisting the commissioner in the preparation of microdata
samples under section 270C.12. The commissioner shall use the information provided on the lists
as appropriate under the law, including for the detection of improper claims by owners, or relatives
of owners, under chapter 290A.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 273.13, subdivision 25, is amended to read:
    Subd. 25. Class 4. (a) Class 4a is residential real estate containing four or more units and used or
held for use by the owner or by the tenants or lessees of the owner as a residence for rental periods
of 30 days or more, excluding property qualifying for class 4d. Class 4a also includes hospitals

platted or subdivided. The market value of class 4a property has a class rate of 1.25 percent.
   (b) Class 4b includes:
   (1) residential real estate containing less than four units that does not qualify as class 4bb, other

than seasonal residential recreational property;
   (2) manufactured homes not classified under any other provision;
   (3) a dwelling, garage, and surrounding one acre of property on a nonhomestead farm classified
under subdivision 23, paragraph (b) containing two or three units; and
   (4) unimproved property that is classified residential as determined under subdivision 33.
   The market value of class 4b property has a class rate of 1.25 percent.
   (c) Class 4bb includes:
                         ­
   ­(1
     ­­) nonhomestead residential real estate containing one unit, other than seasonal residential
recreational property; and
   ­
   (2
    ­­) a single family dwelling, garage, and surrounding one acre of property on a nonhomestead
farm classified under subdivision 23, paragraph (b).
   Class 4bb property has the same class rates as class 1a property under subdivision 22.
    Property that has been classified as seasonal residential recreational property at any time during
which it has been owned by the current owner or spouse of the current owner does not qualify for
class 4bb.
   (d) Class 4c property includes:
    (1) except as provided in subdivision 22, paragraph (c), real and personal property devoted
to commercial temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes, for not
more than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment. For purposes of this clause,
property is devoted to a commercial purpose on a specific day if any portion of the property is
used for residential occupancy, and a fee is charged for residential occupancy. Class 4c property
under this clause must contain three or more rental units. A "rental unit" is defined as a cabin,
condominium, townhouse, sleeping room, or individual camping site equipped with water and
electrical hookups for recreational vehicles. A camping pad offered for rent by a property that
otherwise qualifies for class 4c under this clause is also class 4c under this clause regardless of the
term of the rental agreement, as long as the use of the camping pad does not exceed 250 days. In
order for a property to be classified under this clause, either (i) the business located on the property
must provide recreational activities, at least 40 percent of the annual gross lodging receipts related
to the property must be from business conducted during 90 consecutive days, and either (A) at
least 60 percent of all paid bookings by lodging guests during the year must be for periods of at

the metropolitan area, as defined under section 473.121, subdivision 2, that contains a portion of
a state trail administered by the Department of Natural Resources. For purposes of item (i)(A),
a paid booking of five or more nights shall be counted as two bookings. Class 4c property also
includes commercial use real property used exclusively for recreational purposes in conjunction
with other class 4c property classified under this clause and devoted to temporary and seasonal
residential occupancy for recreational purposes, up to a total of two acres, provided the property
is not devoted to commercial recreational use for more than 250 days in the year preceding the

In order for a property to qualify for classification under this clause, the owner must submit a
declaration to the assessor designating the cabins or units occupied for 250 days or less in the year
preceding the year of assessment by January 15 of the assessment year. Those cabins or units and
a proportionate share of the land on which they are located must be designated class 4c under this
clause as otherwise provided. The remainder of the cabins or units and a proportionate share of
the land on which they are located will be designated as class 3a. The owner of property desiring
designation as class 4c property under this clause must provide guest registers or other records
demonstrating that the units for which class 4c designation is sought were not occupied for more
than 250 days in the year preceding the assessment if so requested. The portion of a property
operated as a (1) restaurant, (2) bar, (3) gift shop, (4) conference center or meeting room, and
(5) other nonresidential facility operated on a commercial basis not directly related to temporary
and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes does not qualify for class 4c. For the

motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski equipment; providing marina services, launch
services, or guide services; or selling bait and fishing tackle;
   (2) qualified property used as a golf course if:
    (i) it is open to the public on a daily fee basis. It may charge membership fees or dues, but a
membership fee may not be required in order to use the property for golfing, and its green fees for
golfing must be comparable to green fees typically charged by municipal courses; and
   (ii) it meets the requirements of section 273.112, subdivision 3, paragraph (d).
   A structure used as a clubhouse, restaurant, or place of refreshment in conjunction with the golf
course is classified as class 3a property;
   (3) real property up to a maximum of three acres of land owned and used by a nonprofit
community service oriented organization and not used for residential purposes on either a
temporary or permanent basis, provided that:

year preceding the year of assessment; or
   (ii) the organization makes annual charitable contributions and donations at least equal to the
property's previous year's property taxes and the property is allowed to be used for public and
community meetings or events for no charge, as appropriate to the size of the facility.
   For purposes of this clause:
    (A) "charitable contributions and donations" has the same meaning as lawful gambling purposes
under section 349.12, subdivision 25, excluding those purposes relating to the payment of taxes,
assessments, fees, auditing costs, and utility payments;
   (B) "property taxes" excludes the state general tax;
    (C) a "nonprofit community service oriented organization" means any corporation, society,

    If the amount of homestead benefits and penalty is not paid within 60 days, and if no appeal has
been filed, the county auditor shall certify the amount of taxes and penalty to the county treasurer.
The county treasurer will add interest to the unpaid homestead benefits and penalty amounts at the
rate provided for delinquent personal property taxes for the period beginning 60 days after demand
for payment was made until payment. If the person notified is the current owner of the property, the
treasurer may add the total amount of benefits, penalty, interest, and costs to the real estate taxes
otherwise payable on the property in the following year. If the person notified is not the current
owner of the property, the treasurer may collect the amounts due under the Revenue Recapture Act in
chapter 270A, or use any of the powers granted in sections 277.20 and 277.21 without exclusion, to
enforce payment of the benefits, penalty, interest, and costs, as if those amounts were delinquent tax
obligations of the person who owned the property at the time the application related to the improperly
allowed homestead was filed. The treasurer may relieve a prior owner of personal liability for the

property for taxes payable in the following year to the extent that the current owner agrees in writing.
    Any amount of homestead benefits recovered by the county from the property owner shall be
distributed to the county, city or town, and school district where the property is located in the same
proportion that each taxing district's levy was to the total of the three taxing districts' levy for the
current year. Any amount recovered attributable to taconite homestead credit shall be transmitted
to the St. Louis County auditor to be deposited in the taconite property tax relief account. Any
amount recovered that is attributable to supplemental homestead credit is to be transmitted to the
commissioner of revenue for deposit in the general fund of the state treasury. The total amount of
penalty collected must be deposited in the county general fund.

   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290B.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Approval; recording. The commissioner shall approve all initial applications that
qualify under this chapter and shall notify qualifying homeowners on or before December 1. The
commissioner may investigate the facts or require confirmation in regard to an application. The
commissioner shall record or file a notice of qualification for deferral, including the names of the
qualifying homeowners and a legal description of the property, in the office of the county recorder,
or registrar of titles, whichever is applicable, in the county where the qualifying property is located.
The notice must state that it serves as a notice of lien and that it includes deferrals under this section
for future years. The commissioner shall prescribe the form of the notice. Execution of the notice by
the original or facsimile signature of the commissioner or a delegate entitles them to be recorded,
and no other attestation, certification, or acknowledgment is necessary. The homeowner shall pay
the recording or filing fees for the notice, which, notwithstanding section 357.18, shall be paid by
the homeowner at the time of satisfaction of the lien.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for notices that are both executed and recorded
after June 30, 2012.

    (2) Acquire and hold real and personal property for the use of the county, and lands sold for
taxes as provided by law.
   (3) Purchase and hold for the benefit of the county real estate sold by virtue of judicial
proceedings, to which the county is a party.
    (4) Sell, lease, and convey real or personal estate owned by the county, and give contracts or
options to sell, lease, or convey it, and make orders respecting it as deemed conducive to the interests
of the county's inhabitants.
   (5) Make all contracts and do all other acts in relation to the property and concerns of the county
necessary to the exercise of its corporate powers.

    (b) No sale, lease, or conveyance of real estate owned by the county, except the lease of a
residence acquired for the furtherance of an approved capital improvement project, nor any contract
or option for it, shall be valid, without first advertising for bids or proposals in the official newspaper
of the county for three consecutive weeks and once in a newspaper of general circulation in the area
where the property is located. The notice shall state the time and place of considering the proposals,
contain a legal description of any real estate, and a brief description of any personal property. Leases
that do not exceed $15,000 for any one year may be negotiated and are not subject to the competitive
bid procedures of this section. All proposals estimated to exceed $15,000 in any one year shall be
considered at the time set for the bid opening, and the one most favorable to the county accepted,
but the county board may, in the interest of the county, reject any or all proposals.
    (c) Sales of personal property the value of which is estimated to be $15,000 or more shall be
made only after advertising for bids or proposals in the county's official newspaper, on the county's
Web site, or in a recognized industry trade journal. At the same time it posts on its Web site or
publishes in a trade journal, the county must publish in the official newspaper, either as part of the
minutes of a regular meeting of the county board or in a separate notice, a summary of all requests
for bids or proposals that the county advertises on its Web site or in a trade journal. After publication
in the official newspaper, on the Web site, or in a trade journal, bids or proposals may be solicited
and accepted by the electronic selling process authorized in section 471.345, subdivision 17. Sales
of personal property the value of which is estimated to be less than $15,000 may be made either
on competitive bids or in the open market, in the discretion of the county board. "Web site" means
a specific, addressable location provided on a server connected to the Internet and hosting World
Wide Web pages and other files that are generally accessible on the Internet all or most of a day.
    (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the county may, when acquiring real
property for county highway right-of-way, exchange parcels of real property of substantially
similar or equal value without advertising for bids. The estimated values for these parcels shall be
determined by the county assessor.
    (e) Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the county may, when acquiring real
property for purposes other than county highway right-of-way, exchange parcels of real property of
substantially similar or equal value without advertising for bids. The estimated values for these
parcels must be determined by the county assessor or a private appraisal performed by a licensed
Minnesota real estate appraiser. For the purpose of making these estimates, the county assessor
need not be licensed under chapter 82B. Before giving final approval to any exchange of land, the
county board shall hold a public hearing on the exchange. At least two weeks before the hearing,
the county auditor shall post a notice in the auditor's office and the official newspaper of the county
of the hearing that contains a description of the lands affected.
    (f) If real estate or personal property remains unsold after advertising for and consideration of
bids or proposals the county may employ a broker to sell the property. The broker may sell the
property for not less than 90 percent of its appraised market value as determined by the county. The
broker's fee shall be set by agreement with the county but may not exceed ten percent of the sale
price and must be paid from the proceeds of the sale.
    (g) A county or its agent may rent a county-owned residence acquired for the furtherance of
an approved capital improvement project subject to the conditions set by the county board and not
subject to the conditions for lease otherwise provided by paragraph (a), clause (4), and paragraphs
(b), (c), (d), (f), and (h).

    (h) In no case shall lands be disposed of without there being reserved to the county all iron ore
and other valuable minerals in and upon the lands, with right to explore for, mine and remove the
iron ore and other valuable minerals, nor shall the minerals and mineral rights be disposed of, either
before or after disposition of the surface rights, otherwise than by mining lease, in similar general
form to that provided by section 93.20 for mining leases affecting state lands. The lease shall be
for a term not exceeding 50 years, and be issued on a royalty basis, the royalty to be not less than
25 cents per ton of 2,240 pounds, and fix a minimum amount of royalty payable during each year,
whether mineral is removed or not. Prospecting options for mining leases may be granted for periods
not exceeding one year. The options shall require, among other things, periodical showings to the
county board of the results of exploration work done.
    (i) Notwithstanding anything in this subdivision to the contrary, the county may, when selling
real property owned in fee simple that cannot be improved because of noncompliance with local
ordinances regarding minimum area, shape, frontage, or access, proceed to sell the nonconforming
parcel without advertising for bid. At the county's discretion, the real property may be restricted
to sale to adjoining landowners or may be sold to any other interested party. The property shall be
sold to the highest bidder, but in no case shall the property be sold for less than 90 percent of its
fair market value as determined by the county assessor. All owners of land adjoining the land to be
sold shall be given a written notice at least 30 days before the sale. This paragraph shall be liberally
construed to encourage the sale of nonconforming real property and promote its return to the tax
roles.

   297A.665 PRESUMPTION OF TAX; BURDEN OF PROOF.
    (a) For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to prevent evasion of the tax,
until the contrary is established, it is presumed that:
   (1) all gross receipts are subject to the tax; and
   (2) all retail sales for delivery in Minnesota are for storage, use, or other consumption in
Minnesota.
    (b) The burden of proving that a sale is not a taxable retail sale is on the seller. However, a seller
is relieved of liability if:
    (1) the seller obtains a fully completed exemption certificate or all the relevant information
required by section 297A.72, subdivision 2, at the time of the sale or within 90 days after the date
of the sale; or
    (2) if the seller has not obtained a fully completed exemption certificate or all the relevant

that the information relating to the exemption was materially false; or

    Sec. 9. [297I.11] AUTOMOBILE THEFT PREVENTION SURCHARGE.
    Subdivision 1. Surcharge. Each insurer engaged in the writing of policies of automobile
insurance shall collect a surcharge, at the rate of 50 cents per vehicle for every six months of
coverage, on each policy of automobile insurance providing comprehensive insurance coverage
issued or renewed in this state. The surcharge may not be considered premium for any purpose,
including the computation of premium tax or agents' commissions. The amount of the surcharge
must be separately stated on either a billing or policy declaration sent to an insured. Insurers shall
remit the revenue derived from this surcharge to the commissioner of revenue for purposes of the
automobile theft prevention program described in section 65B.84. For purposes of this subdivision,
"policy of automobile insurance" has the meaning given it in section 65B.14, covering only the
following types of vehicles as defined in section 168.002:

    (4) a motorcycle,
except that no vehicle with a gross vehicle weight in excess of 10,000 pounds is included within
this definition.
    Subd. 2. Automobile theft prevention account. A special revenue account in the state treasury
shall be credited with the proceeds of the surcharge imposed under subdivision 1. Of the revenue
in the account, $1,300,000 each year must be transferred to the general fund. Revenues in excess of
$1,300,000 each year may be used only for the automobile theft prevention program described in
section 65B.84.
    Subd. 3. Collection and administration. The commissioner shall collect and administer the
surcharge imposed by this section in the same manner as the taxes imposed by this chapter. The
commissioner is appropriated annually, from the automobile theft prevention special revenue
account, an amount to reimburse the Department of Revenue for the costs incurred in administering
and collecting the surcharge imposed under subdivision 1.

section shall apportion its net income on the basis of the percentage obtained by taking the sum of:
    (1) 75 percent of the percentage which the sales made within this state in connection with the
trade or business during the tax period are of the total sales wherever made in connection with the

action of the commissioner is otherwise specifically provided for by law, notice of the determination
or action sent postage prepaid by United States mail to the taxpayer or other person affected by the
determination or action at the taxpayer's or person's last known address, is sufficient. If the taxpayer
or person being notified is deceased or is under a legal disability, or, in the case of a corporation
being notified that has terminated its existence, notice to the last known address of the taxpayer,
person, or corporation is sufficient, unless the department has been provided with a new address by
a party authorized to receive notices from the commissioner.
    (b) If a taxpayer or other person agrees to accept notification by electronic means, notice of a

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 270C.42, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Penalty for failure to pay electronically. In addition to other applicable penalties
imposed by law, after notification from the commissioner to the taxpayer that payments for a tax
payable to the commissioner are required to be made by electronic means, and the payments are
remitted by some other means, there is a penalty in the amount of five percent of each payment that
should have been remitted electronically. After the commissioner's initial notification to the taxpayer
that payments are required to be made by electronic means, the commissioner is not required to
notify the taxpayer in subsequent periods if the initial notification specified the amount of tax liability
at which a taxpayer is required to remit payments by electronic means. The penalty can be abated

   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 270C.69, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Notice and procedures. (a) The commissioner may, within five years after the
date of assessment of the tax, or if a lien has been filed under section 270C.63, within the statutory
period for enforcement of the lien, give notice to any employer deriving income which has a taxable
situs in this state regardless of whether the income is exempt from taxation, that an employee of that
employer is delinquent in a certain amount with respect to any taxes, including penalties, interest,
and costs. The commissioner can proceed under this section only if the tax is uncontested or if the
time for appeal of the tax has expired. The commissioner shall not proceed under this section until
the expiration of 30 days after mailing to the taxpayer, at the taxpayer's last known address, a written
notice of (1) the amount of taxes, interest, and penalties due from the taxpayer and demand for their
payment, and (2) the commissioner's intention to require additional withholding by the taxpayer's
employer pursuant to this section. The effect of the notice shall expire one year after it has been
mailed to the taxpayer provided that the notice may be renewed by mailing a new notice which is in
accordance with this section. The renewed notice shall have the effect of reinstating the priority of
the original claim. The notice to the taxpayer shall be in substantially the same form as that provided
in section 571.72. The notice shall further inform the taxpayer of the wage exemptions contained in
section 550.37, subdivision 14. If no statement of exemption is received by the commissioner within
30 days from the mailing of the notice, the commissioner may proceed under this section. The notice

to the taxpayer's employer may be served by mail or by delivery by an agent of the department and
shall be in substantially the same form as provided in section 571.75. Upon receipt of notice, the
employer shall withhold from compensation due or to become due to the employee, the total amount
shown by the notice, subject to the provisions of section 571.922. The employer shall continue to
withhold each pay period until the notice is released by the commissioner under section 270C.7109.
Upon receipt of notice by the employer, the claim of the state of Minnesota shall have priority over
any subsequent garnishments or wage assignments. The commissioner may arrange between the
employer and the employee for withholding a portion of the total amount due the employee each
pay period, until the total amount shown by the notice plus accrued interest has been withheld.
    (b) The "compensation due" any employee is defined in accordance with the provisions of section
571.921. The maximum withholding allowed under this section for any one pay period shall be
decreased by any amounts payable pursuant to a garnishment action with respect to which the
employer was served prior to being served with the notice of delinquency and any amounts covered
by any irrevocable and previously effective assignment of wages; the employer shall give notice to
the commissioner of the amounts and the facts relating to such assignments within ten days after
the service of the notice of delinquency on the form provided by the commissioner as noted in this
section.
   (c) Within ten days after the expiration of such pay period, the employer shall remit to the
commissioner, on a form and in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, the amount withheld
during each pay period under this section. The employer must file all wage levy disclosure forms
and remit all wage levy payments by electronic means.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for wage levy disclosures or wage levy payments
filed or made after December 31, 2012.

    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 289A.60, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
   Subd. 4. Substantial understatement of liability; penalty. (a) The commissioner of revenue
shall impose a penalty for substantial understatement of any tax payable to the commissioner, except
118TH DAY]                           WEDNESDAY, MAY 9, 2012                                           7465

a tax imposed under chapter 297A.
    (b) There must be added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of the amount of any
underpayment attributable to the understatement. There is a substantial understatement of tax for
the period if the amount of the understatement for the period exceeds the greater of:
    (1) ten percent of the tax required to be shown on the return for the period; or
    (2)(i) $10,000 in the case of a mining company or a corporation, other than an S corporation as
defined in section 290.9725, when the tax is imposed by chapter 290 or section 298.01 or 298.015,
or
   (ii) $5,000 in the case of any other taxpayer, and in the case of a mining company or a corporation
any tax not imposed by chapter 290 or section 298.01 or 298.015.
    (c) For a corporation, other than an S corporation, there is also a substantial understatement of
tax for any taxable year if the amount of the understatement for the taxable year exceeds the lesser
of:
   (1) ten percent of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable year (or, if greater,
$10,000); or
    (2) $10,000,000.
    (d) The term "understatement" means the excess of the amount of the tax required to be shown
on the return for the period, over the amount of the tax imposed that is shown on the return. The
excess must be determined without regard to items to which subdivision 27 applies. The amount of
the understatement shall be reduced by that part of the understatement that is attributable to the tax
treatment of any item by the taxpayer if (1) there is or was substantial authority for the treatment,
or (2)(i) any item with respect to which the relevant facts affecting the item's tax treatment are
adequately disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the return and (ii) there is a reasonable
basis for the tax treatment of the item. The exception for substantial authority under clause (1)
does not apply to positions listed by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 6662(d)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code. A corporation does not have a reasonable basis for its tax treatment of an
item attributable to a multiple-party financing transaction if the treatment does not clearly reflect
the income of the corporation within the meaning of section 6662(d)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue
Code. The special rules in cases involving tax shelters provided in section 6662(d)(2)(C) of the
Internal Revenue Code shall apply and shall apply to a tax shelter the principal purpose of which is
the avoidance or evasion of state taxes.
    (e) The commissioner may abate all or any part of the addition to the tax provided by this section
on a showing by the taxpayer that there was reasonable cause for the understatement, or part of it,
and that the taxpayer acted in good faith. The additional tax and penalty shall bear interest ­      a­

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
any bonding authority allocated in 2011 and subsequent years.
     Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 474A.091, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. Mortgage bonds. (a) Bonding authority remaining in the unified pool on October
1 is available for single-family housing programs for cities that applied in January and received
an allocation under section 474A.061, subdivision 2a, in the same calendar year. The Minnesota
Housing Finance Agency shall receive an allocation for mortgage bonds pursuant to this section,
minus any amounts for a city or consortium that intends to issue bonds on its own behalf under
paragraph (c).
    (b) The agency may issue bonds on behalf of participating cities. The agency shall request an
allocation from the commissioner for all applicants who choose to have the agency issue bonds on
their behalf and the commissioner shall allocate the requested amount to the agency. Allocations
shall be awarded by the commissioner each Monday commencing on the first Monday in October
through the last Monday in November for applications received by 4:30 p.m. on the Monday of the
week preceding an allocation.
    For cities who choose to have the agency issue bonds on their behalf, allocations will be made
loan by loan, on a first-come, first-served basis among the cities. The agency shall submit an
application fee pursuant to section 474A.03, subdivision 4, and an application deposit equal to two
percent of the requested allocation to the commissioner when requesting an allocation from the
unified pool. After awarding an allocation and receiving a notice of issuance for mortgage bonds
issued on behalf of the participating cities, the commissioner shall transfer the application deposit
to the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency.
    For purposes of paragraphs (a) to (d), "city" means a county or a consortium of local government
units that agree through a joint powers agreement to apply together for single-family housing
programs, and has the meaning given it in section 462C.02, subdivision 6. "Agency" means the
Minnesota Housing Finance Agency.
     (c) Any city that received an allocation pursuant to section 474A.061, subdivision 2a, paragraph
(f), in the current year that wishes to receive an additional allocation from the unified pool and issue
bonds on its own behalf or pursuant to a joint powers agreement shall notify the Minnesota Housing
7472                                     JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                         [118TH DAY

Finance Agency by the third Monday in September. The total amount of allocation for mortgage
bonds for a city choosing to issue bonds on its own behalf or through a joint powers agreement is
limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount requested, or (ii) the product of the total amount available
for mortgage bonds from the unified pool, multiplied by the ratio of the population of each city that
applied in January and received an allocation under section 474A.061, subdivision 2a, in the same
calendar year, as determined by the most recent estimate of the city's population released by the
state demographer's office to the total of the population of all the cities that applied in January and
received an allocation under section 474A.061, subdivision 2a, in the same calendar year. If a city
choosing to issue bonds on its own behalf or through a joint powers agreement is located within a
county that has also chosen to issue bonds on its own behalf or through a joint powers agreement,
the city's population will be deducted from the county's population in calculating the amount of
allocations under this paragraph.
    The Minnesota Housing Finance Agency shall notify each city choosing to issue bonds on its
own behalf or pursuant to a joint powers agreement of the amount of its allocation by October 15.
Upon determining the amount of the allocation of each choosing to issue bonds on its own behalf
or through a joint powers agreement, the agency shall forward a list specifying the amounts allotted
to each city.
    A city that chooses to issue bonds on its own behalf or through a joint powers agreement may
request an allocation from the commissioner by forwarding an application with an application fee
pursuant to section 474A.03, subdivision 4, and an application deposit equal to two percent of the
requested amount to the commissioner no later than 4:30 p.m. on the Monday of the week preceding
an allocation. Allocations to cities that choose to issue bonds on their own behalf shall be awarded
by the commissioner on the first Monday after October 15 through the last Monday in November.
No city may receive an allocation from the commissioner after the last Monday in November. The
commissioner shall allocate the requested amount to the city or cities subject to the limitations under
this subdivision.
    If a city issues mortgage bonds from an allocation received under this paragraph, the issuer must
provide for the recycling of funds into new loans. If the issuer is not able to provide for recycling,
the issuer must notify the commissioner in writing of the reason that recycling was not possible and
the reason the issuer elected not to have the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency issue the bonds.
"Recycling" means the use of money generated from the repayment and prepayment of loans for
further eligible loans or for the redemption of bonds and the issuance of current refunding bonds.
   (d) No entitlement city or county or city in an entitlement county may apply for or be allocated
authority to issue mortgage bonds or use mortgage credit certificates from the unified pool.
     (e) An allocation awarded to the agency for mortgage bonds under this section may be carried
forward by the agency ­n   i­­o

improvements under an approved capital improvements plan are not subject to the election
requirements of section 475.58. The bonds must be approved by an affirmative vote of three-fifths
of the members of a five-member governing body. In the case of a governing body having more or
less than five members, the bonds must be approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the members
of the governing body.
    (b) Before the issuance of bonds qualifying under this section, the municipality must publish
a notice of its intention to issue the bonds and the date and time of the hearing to obtain public
comment on the matter. The notice must be published in the official newspaper of the municipality
or in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality. Additionally, the notice may be posted
on the official Web site, if any, of the municipality. The notice must be published at least 14 but not
more than 28 days before the date of the hearing.
     (c) A municipality may issue the bonds only after obtaining the approval of a majority of the
voters voting on the question of issuing the obligations, if a petition requesting a vote on the issuance
is signed by voters equal to five percent of the votes cast in the municipality in the last municipal
general election and is filed with the clerk within 30 days after the public hearing. T   ­h e­

    Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 475.521, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Limitations on amount. A municipality may not issue bonds under this section if the
maximum amount of principal and interest to become due in any year on all the outstanding bonds
issued under this section, including the bonds to be issued, will equal or exceed 0.16 percent of the
taxable market value of property in the municipality. Calculation of the limit must be made using
the taxable market value for the taxes payable year in which the obligations are issued and sold,
provided that, for purposes of determining the principal and interest due in any year, the municipality
may deduct the amount of interest expected to be paid or reimbursed to the municipality by the
federal government in that year on any outstanding bonds or the bonds to be issued. In the case of a
municipality with a population of 2,500 or more, the bonds are subject to the net debt limits under
section 475.53. In the case of a shared facility in which more than one municipality participates,
upon compliance by each participating municipality with the requirements of subdivision 2, the
limitations in this subdivision and the net debt represented by the bonds shall be allocated to each
participating municipality in proportion to its required financial contribution to the financing of the
shared facility, as set forth in the joint powers agreement relating to the shared facility. This section
does not limit the authority to issue bonds under any other special or general law.

majority of the voters voting on the question of the issuance of the obligations. If the municipality
elects not to submit the question to the voters, the municipality shall not propose the issuance of
bonds under this section for the same purpose and in the same amount for a period of 365 days from
the date of receipt of the petition. If the question of issuing the bonds is submitted and not approved
by the voters, the provisions of subdivision 1a, apply.
    (b) Obligations issued under this subdivision are subject to the debt limit of the municipality and

owner, issued by the county within 30 days of receipt of the application, provided that there are
no delinquent taxes on the property. The credit must be given for each subsequent taxes payable
year until the credit terminates under subdivision 4. For taxes payable in 2013 and thereafter, the
assessor shall indicate the amount of the property tax reduction on the property tax statement of
each taxpayer receiving a credit under this section. For taxes payable in 2013 and thereafter, the
credit paid pursuant to this section shall be deducted from the tax due on the property as provided
in section 273.1393.
    Subd. 3. Reimbursement for lost revenue. The county auditor shall certify to the commissioner
of revenue, as part of the abstracts of tax lists required to be filed with the commissioner under
section 275.29, the amount of tax lost to the county from the property tax credit under subdivision
2, except that for taxes payable in 2012 only, the county shall submit the credit amounts to the
commissioner of revenue in a separate report, in a form prescribed by the commissioner, prior to
August 15, 2012. Any prior year adjustments must also be certified in the abstracts of tax lists.
The commissioner of revenue shall review the certifications to determine their accuracy. The
commissioner may make the changes in the certification that are considered necessary or return a
certification to the county auditor for corrections. The commissioner shall reimburse each taxing
district, other than school districts, for the taxes lost. The payments must be made at the time
provided in section 473H.10 for payment to taxing jurisdictions in the same proportion that the ad
valorem tax is distributed, except that for taxes payable in 2012 the entire reimbursement must
be made to the county. Reimbursements to school districts must be made as provided in section
273.1392. The amount necessary to make the reimbursements under this section is annually
appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of revenue.

   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 275.025, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

subsequent years, the levy base amount is increased each year by multiplying the levy base amount
for the prior year by the sum of one plus the rate of increase, if any, in the implicit price deflator
for government consumption expenditures and gross investment for state and local governments
prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysts of the United States Department of Commerce for
the 12-month period ending March 31 of the year prior to the year the taxes are payable. The tax
under this section is not treated as a local tax rate under section 469.177 and is not the levy of a
governmental unit under chapters 276A and 473F.
    The commissioner shall increase or decrease the preliminary or final ­     r­t­ rates for a year as
                                                                                a­e

reasons:
   (1) an erroneous report of taxable value by a local official;
   (2) an erroneous calculation by the commissioner; and
    (3) an increase or decrease in taxable value for commercial-industrial or seasonal residential
recreational property reported on the abstracts of tax lists submitted under section 275.29 that was
not reported on the abstracts of assessment submitted under section 270C.89 for the same year.
The commissioner may, but need not, make adjustments if the total difference in the tax levied for
the year would be less than $100,000.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2013 and thereafter.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 275.065, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Proposed levy. (a) Notwithstanding any law or charter to the contrary, on or
before September 15, each taxing authority, other than a school district, shall adopt a proposed
budget and shall certify to the county auditor the proposed or, in the case of a town, the final property
tax levy for taxes payable in the following year. All counties with a population of more than 5,000
and home rule charter or statutory cities with a population of more than 5,000, shall also provide to
the county auditor the county or city Web site, if there is one, where the public is able to access the
budget information required to be reported under section 471.703.
    (b) On or before September 30, each school district that has not mutually agreed with its home
county to extend this date shall certify to the county auditor the proposed property tax levy for taxes
payable in the following year. Each school district that has agreed with its home county to delay
the certification of its proposed property tax levy must certify its proposed property tax levy for the
following year no later than October 7. The school district shall certify the proposed levy as:
   (1) a specific dollar amount by school district fund, broken down between voter-approved and
non-voter-approved levies and between referendum market value and tax capacity levies; or
   (2) the maximum levy limitation certified by the commissioner of education according to section
126C.48, subdivision 1.
    (c) If the board of estimate and taxation or any similar board that establishes maximum tax levies
for taxing jurisdictions within a first class city certifies the maximum property tax levies for funds
under its jurisdiction by charter to the county auditor by September 15, the city shall be deemed to
have certified its levies for those taxing jurisdictions.
    (d) For purposes of this section, "taxing authority" includes all home rule and statutory
cities, towns, counties, school districts, and special taxing districts as defined in section 275.066.
Intermediate school districts that levy a tax under chapter 124 or 136D, joint powers boards
established under sections 123A.44 to 123A.446, and Common School Districts No. 323,
Franconia, and No. 815, Prinsburg, are also special taxing districts for purposes of this section.
    (e) At the meeting at which the taxing authority, other than a town, adopts its proposed tax levy
under paragraph (a) or (b), the taxing authority shall announce the time and place of its subsequent
regularly scheduled meetings at which the budget and levy will be discussed and at which the public
will be allowed to speak. T

   (2) a statement that the budget information required to be reported under section 471.703 is

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2012.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 275.065, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Notice of proposed property taxes. (a) The county auditor shall prepare and the county
treasurer shall deliver after November 10 and on or before November 24 each year, by first class
mail to each taxpayer at the address listed on the county's current year's assessment roll, a notice of
proposed property taxes. Upon written request by the taxpayer, the treasurer may send the notice in
electronic form or by electronic mail instead of on paper or by ordinary mail.
   (b) The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the notice.
     (c) The notice must inform taxpayers that it contains the amount of property taxes each taxing
authority proposes to collect for taxes payable the following year. In the case of a town, or in the
case of the state general tax, the final tax amount will be its proposed tax. The notice must clearly
state for each city that has a population over 500, county, school district, regional library authority
established under section 134.201, and metropolitan taxing districts as defined in paragraph (i), the
time and place of a meeting for each taxing authority in which the budget and levy will be discussed
and public input allowed, prior to the final budget and levy determination. The notice must clearly
state for each county with a population of more than 5,000 and for each city with a population
of more than 5,000 that the budget information required to be reported under section 471.703 is
available on the county or city Web site, if there is one. The taxing authorities must provide the
county auditor with the information to be included in the notice on or before the time it certifies
its proposed levy under subdivision 1. The public must be allowed to speak at that meeting, which
must occur after November 24 and must not be held before 6:00 p.m. It must provide a telephone
number for the taxing authority that taxpayers may call if they have questions related to the notice
and an address where comments will be received by mail, except that no notice required under this
section shall be interpreted as requiring the printing of a personal telephone number or address as
the contact information for a taxing authority. If a taxing authority does not maintain public offices
where telephone calls can be received by the authority, the authority may inform the county of the
lack of a public telephone number and the county shall not list a telephone number for that taxing
authority.
   (d) The notice must state for each parcel:
    (1) the market value of the property as determined under section 273.11, and used for computing
property taxes payable in the following year and for taxes payable in the current year as each appears
in the records of the county assessor on November 1 of the current year; and, in the case of residential
property, whether the property is classified as homestead or nonhomestead. The notice must clearly
inform taxpayers of the years to which the market values apply and that the values are final values;
    (2) the items listed below, shown separately by county, city or town, and state general tax, net
of the residential and agricultural homestead credit under section 273.1384, voter approved school

levy, other local school levy, and the sum of the special taxing districts, and as a total of all taxing
authorities:
   (i) the actual tax for taxes payable in the current year; and
   (ii) the proposed tax amount.
    If the county levy under clause (2) includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed
amount that a referendum is pending and that, if approved by the voters, the tax amount may be
higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, the levy for Minneapolis
Park and Recreation shall be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the
case of the city of St. Paul, the levy for the St. Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from
the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under
section 134.07 may be listed separately from the remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case
of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F
applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity
subject to the areawide tax must each be stated separately and not included in the sum of the special
taxing districts; and
   (3) the increase or decrease between the total taxes payable in the current year and the total
proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.
    For purposes of this section, the amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior
citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before
subtraction of the deferred property tax amount.
   (e) The notice must clearly state that the proposed or final taxes do not include the following:
   (1) special assessments;
    (2) levies approved by the voters after the date the proposed taxes are certified, including bond
referenda and school district levy referenda;
  (3) a levy limit increase approved by the voters by the first Tuesday after the first Monday in
November of the levy year as provided under section 275.73;
    (4) amounts necessary to pay cleanup or other costs due to a natural disaster occurring after the
date the proposed taxes are certified;
    (5) amounts necessary to pay tort judgments against the taxing authority that become final after
the date the proposed taxes are certified; and
   (6) the contamination tax imposed on properties which received market value reductions for
contamination.

    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 7, failure of the county auditor to prepare or the county
treasurer to deliver the notice as required in this section does not invalidate the proposed or final tax
levy or the taxes payable pursuant to the tax levy.
    (g) If the notice the taxpayer receives under this section lists the property as nonhomestead,
and satisfactory documentation is provided to the county assessor by the applicable deadline, and
the property qualifies for the homestead classification in that assessment year, the assessor shall
reclassify the property to homestead for taxes payable in the following year.
   (h) In the case of class 4 residential property used as a residence for lease or rental periods of 30
days or more, the taxpayer must either:
    (1) mail or deliver a copy of the notice of proposed property taxes to each tenant, renter, or
lessee; or
   (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
    The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of
receipt of the notice, whichever is later. A taxpayer may notify the county treasurer of the address
of the taxpayer, agent, caretaker, or manager of the premises to which the notice must be mailed in
order to fulfill the requirements of this paragraph.

included with the appropriate county's levy.
    (j) The governing body of a county, city, or school district may, with the consent of the county
board, include supplemental information with the statement of proposed property taxes about
the impact of state aid increases or decreases on property tax increases or decreases and on the
level of services provided in the affected jurisdiction. This supplemental information may include
information for the following year, the current year, and for as many consecutive preceding years
as deemed appropriate by the governing body of the county, city, or school district. It may include
only information regarding:
   (1) the impact of inflation as measured by the implicit price deflator for state and local
government purchases;
   (2) population growth and decline;
   (3) state or federal government action; and

    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 275.065, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Notice of proposed property taxes. (a) The county auditor shall prepare and the county
treasurer shall deliver after November 10 and on or before November 24 each year, by first class
mail to each taxpayer at the address listed on the county's current year's assessment roll, a notice of
proposed property taxes. Upon written request by the taxpayer, the treasurer may send the notice in
electronic form or by electronic mail instead of on paper or by ordinary mail.
    (b) The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the notice.
    (c) The notice must inform taxpayers that it contains the amount of property taxes each taxing
authority proposes to collect for taxes payable the following year. In the case of a town, or in the case
                                                                         ­h

each city that has a population over 500, county, school district, regional library authority established
under section 134.201, and metropolitan taxing districts as defined in paragraph (i), the notice must
state the time and place of a meeting for each taxing authority in which the budget and levy will
be discussed and public input allowed, prior to the final budget and levy determination. For each
special taxing district, the notice must: (1) list separately any levy by a special taxing district that
exceeds 25 percent of the total of all special taxing district levies; and (2) provide county government
contact information where additional information may be obtained for each special taxing district.
The taxing authorities must provide the county auditor with the information to be included in the
notice on or before the time it certifies its proposed levy under subdivision 1. The public must be
allowed to speak at that meeting, which must occur after November 24 and must not be held before
6:00 p.m. It must provide a telephone number for the taxing authority that taxpayers may call if
they have questions related to the notice and an address where comments will be received by mail,
except that no notice required under this section shall be interpreted as requiring the printing of a
personal telephone number or address as the contact information for a taxing authority. If a taxing
authority does not maintain public offices where telephone calls can be received by the authority,
the authority may inform the county of the lack of a public telephone number and the county shall
not list a telephone number for that taxing authority.
    (d) The notice must state for each parcel:
    (1) the market value of the property as determined under section 273.11, and used for computing
property taxes payable in the following year and for taxes payable in the current year as each appears
in the records of the county assessor on November 1 of the current year; and, in the case of residential
property, whether the property is classified as homestead or nonhomestead. The notice must clearly
inform taxpayers of the years to which the market values apply and that the values are final values;

   (ii) the proposed tax amount.
    If the county levy under clause (2) includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed
amount that a referendum is pending and that, if approved by the voters, the tax amount may be
higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, the levy for Minneapolis
Park and Recreation shall be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the
case of the city of St. Paul, the levy for the St. Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from
the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under
section 134.07 may be listed separately from the remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case
of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F
applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity
subject to the areawide tax must each be stated separately and not included in the sum of the special
taxing districts; and

proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.
    For purposes of this section, the amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior
citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before

   (1) special assessments;
    (2) levies approved by the voters after the date the proposed taxes are certified, including bond
referenda and school district levy referenda;
  (3) a levy limit increase approved by the voters by the first Tuesday after the first Monday in
November of the levy year as provided under section 275.73;
    (4) amounts necessary to pay cleanup or other costs due to a natural disaster occurring after the
date the proposed taxes are certified;

    (g) If the notice the taxpayer receives under this section lists the property as nonhomestead,
and satisfactory documentation is provided to the county assessor by the applicable deadline, and
the property qualifies for the homestead classification in that assessment year, the assessor shall

    (1) mail or deliver a copy of the notice of proposed property taxes to each tenant, renter, or
lessee; or
   (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
    The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of
receipt of the notice, whichever is later. A taxpayer may notify the county treasurer of the address
of the taxpayer, agent, caretaker, or manager of the premises to which the notice must be mailed in
order to fulfill the requirements of this paragraph.
    (i) For purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 6, "metropolitan special taxing districts"
means the following taxing districts in the seven-county metropolitan area that levy a property tax
for any of the specified purposes listed below:
   (1) Metropolitan Council under section 473.132, 473.167, 473.249, 473.325, 473.446, 473.521,

governing body of the county, city, or school district may deem appropriate to include.
   The information may be presented using tables, written narrative, and graphic representations
and may contain instruction toward further sources of information or opportunity for comment.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for tax statements relating to taxes payable in
2014 and thereafter.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 276.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Contents of tax statements. (a) The treasurer shall provide for the printing of the tax
statements. The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the property tax statement and
its contents. The tax statement must not state or imply that property tax credits are paid by the state of
Minnesota. The statement must contain a tabulated statement of the dollar amount due to each taxing
authority and the amount of the state tax from the parcel of real property for which a particular tax
statement is prepared. The dollar amounts attributable to the county, the state tax, the voter approved
school tax, the other local school tax, the township or municipality, and the total of the metropolitan
special taxing districts as defined in section 275.065, subdivision 3, paragraph (i), must be separately
stated. The amounts due all other special taxing districts, if any, may be aggregated except ­h   t­­
                                                                                                    a­

any levies made by the regional rail authorities in the county of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin,
Ramsey, Scott, or Washington under chapter 398A shall be listed on a separate line directly under
the appropriate county's levy, and (2) any levy by a special taxing district that exceeds 25 percent
of the total of all special taxing district levies on a tax statement must be separately stated. If the
county levy under this paragraph includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount. In the case of Ramsey County, if the county levy
under this paragraph includes an amount for public library service under section 134.07, the amount
attributable for that purpose may be separated from the remaining county levy amount. The amount
of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior citizens' property tax deferral program under
chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before subtraction of the deferred property tax
amount. The amount of the tax on contamination value imposed under sections 270.91 to 270.98, if
any, must also be separately stated. The dollar amounts, including the dollar amount of any special
assessments, may be rounded to the nearest even whole dollar. For purposes of this section whole
odd-numbered dollars may be adjusted to the next higher even-numbered dollar. The amount of
market value excluded under section 273.11, subdivision 16, if any, must also be listed on the tax
statement.
   (b) The property tax statements for manufactured homes and sectional structures taxed as
personal property shall contain the same information that is required on the tax statements for real
property.
   (c) Real and personal property tax statements must contain the following information in the order
given in this paragraph. The information must contain the current year tax information in the right
column with the corresponding information for the previous year in a column on the left:
   (1) the property's estimated market value under section 273.11, subdivision 1;
   (2) the property's homestead market value exclusion under section 273.13, subdivision 35;

   (3) the property's taxable market value after reductions under sections 273.11, subdivisions 1a
and 16, and 273.13, subdivision 35;
   (4) the property's gross tax, before credits;
   (5) for homestead agricultural properties, the credit under section 273.1384;
    (6) any credits received under sections 273.119; 273.1234 or 273.1235; 273.135; 273.1391;
273.1398, subdivision 4; 469.171; and 473H.10, except that the amount of credit received under
section 273.135 must be separately stated and identified as "taconite tax relief"; and
   (7) the net tax payable in the manner required in paragraph (a).
    (d) If the county uses envelopes for mailing property tax statements and if the county agrees, a
taxing district may include a notice with the property tax statement notifying taxpayers when the
taxing district will begin its budget deliberations for the current year, and encouraging taxpayers
to attend the hearings. If the county allows notices to be included in the envelope containing the
property tax statement, and if more than one taxing district relative to a given property decides to
include a notice with the tax statement, the county treasurer or auditor must coordinate the process
and may combine the information on a single announcement.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for tax statements relating to taxes payable in
2014 and thereafter.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 290A.04, subdivision 2h, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2h. Additional refund. (a) If the gross property taxes payable on a homestead increase
more than 12 percent over the property taxes payable in the prior year on the same property that is
owned and occupied by the same owner on January 2 of both years, and the amount of that increase
is $100 or more, a claimant who is a homeowner shall be allowed an additional refund equal to 6  ­­0
75 percent of the amount of the increase over the greater of 12 percent of the prior year's property
taxes payable or $100. This subdivision shall not apply to any increase in the gross property taxes
payable attributable to improvements made to the homestead after the assessment date for the prior
year's taxes. This subdivision shall not apply to any increase in the gross property taxes payable
attributable to the termination of valuation exclusions under section 273.11, subdivision 16.
   The maximum refund allowed under this subdivision is $1,000.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision "gross property taxes payable" means property taxes payable
determined without regard to the refund allowed under this subdivision.
    (c) In addition to the other proofs required by this chapter, each claimant under this subdivision
shall file with the property tax refund return a copy of the property tax statement for taxes payable
in the preceding year or other documents required by the commissioner.
    (d) Upon request, the appropriate county official shall make available the names and addresses of
the property taxpayers who may be eligible for the additional property tax refund under this section.
The information shall be provided on a magnetic computer disk. The county may recover its costs
by charging the person requesting the information the reasonable cost for preparing the data. The
information may not be used for any purpose other than for notifying the homeowner of potential

   Subd. 2. Definitions. (a) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings
given in this subdivision.
    (b) "Municipality" means a county with a population of more than 5,000 or a home rule charter
or statutory city with a population of more than 5,000.
    (c) "Population" means the population of the municipality as established by the last federal

population estimate of the state demographer made pursuant to section 4A.02, whichever is the
most recent as to the stated date of the count or estimate for the preceding calendar year, and which
has been certified to the commissioner of revenue on or before July 15 of the year in which the
information is required to be reported.
    Subd. 3. Electronic budgetary information. (a) By July 31 of each year, a municipality shall
publish on its Web site, except as provided in subdivision 4, four years of budget information on

special revenue funds specifically used for the acquisition and construction of major capital facilities.
The reported information shall also exclude enterprise funds and fiduciary funds.
   (c) The forms and reporting requirements for revenues and expenditures by function shall
be established by the state auditor's office and shall be based on the revenue and expenditure

consult with the commissioner of management and budget, city and county representatives, and
members of the governmental accounting community in developing the definition of expenditure
types for reporting purposes.

maintain an official Web site must either (1) set up a separate Web site to make accessible the

$12,000,000 in credits per year for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, and before
January 1, 2015. Any portion of a taxable year's credits that is not allocated by the commissioner
does not cancel and may be carried forward to subsequent taxable years until all credits have been
allocated.
    (b) The commissioner may not allocate more than a total maximum amount in credits for
a taxable year to a qualified investor for the investor's cumulative qualified investments as an
individual qualified investor and as an investor in a qualified fund; for married couples filing
joint returns the maximum is $250,000, and for all other filers the maximum is $125,000. The

Applications for subsequent years must be made available by November 1 of the preceding year.

credits must be allocated to qualified investors or qualified funds in the order that the tax credit
request applications are filed with the department. The commissioner must approve or reject tax
credit request applications within 15 days of receiving the application. The investment specified in
the application must be made within 60 days of the allocation of the credits. If the investment is not
made within 60 days, the credit allocation is canceled and available for reallocation. A qualified
investor or qualified fund that fails to invest as specified in the application, within 60 days of
allocation of the credits, must notify the commissioner of the failure to invest within five business
days of the expiration of the 60-day investment period.
    (f) All tax credit request applications filed with the department on the same day must be treated
as having been filed contemporaneously. If two or more qualified investors or qualified funds file
tax credit request applications on the same day, and the aggregate amount of credit allocation claims
exceeds the aggregate limit of credits under this section or the lesser amount of credits that remain
unallocated on that day, then the credits must be allocated among the qualified investors or qualified
funds who filed on that day on a pro rata basis with respect to the amounts claimed. The pro rata
allocation for any one qualified investor or qualified fund is the product obtained by multiplying
a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the credit allocation claim filed on behalf of a
qualified investor and the denominator of which is the total of all credit allocation claims filed on
behalf of all applicants on that day, by the amount of credits that remain unallocated on that day for

the taxable year.
    (g) A qualified investor or qualified fund, or a qualified small business acting on their behalf,
must notify the commissioner when an investment for which credits were allocated has been made,
and the taxable year in which the investment was made. A qualified fund must also provide the
commissioner with a statement indicating the amount invested by each investor in the qualified
fund based on each investor's share of the assets of the qualified fund at the time of the qualified
investment. After receiving notification that the investment was made, the commissioner must issue
credit certificates for the taxable year in which the investment was made to the qualified investor or,
for an investment made by a qualified fund, to each qualified investor who is an investor in the fund.
The certificate must state that the credit is subject to revocation if the qualified investor or qualified
fund does not hold the investment in the qualified small business for at least three years, consisting
of the calendar year in which the investment was made and the two following years. The three-year
holding period does not apply if:
    (1) the investment by the qualified investor or qualified fund becomes worthless before the end
of the three-year period;
    (2) 80 percent or more of the assets of the qualified small business is sold before the end of the
three-year period;
   (3) the qualified small business is sold before the end of the three-year period; or
   (4) the qualified small business's common stock begins trading on a public exchange before the
end of the three-year period.
    (h) The commissioner must notify the commissioner of revenue of credit certificates issued under
this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2011.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 116J.8737, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5a. Promotion of credit in greater Minnesota. (a) By July 1, 2012, the commissioner
shall develop a plan to increase awareness of and use of the credit for investments in greater
Minnesota businesses with a target goal that a minimum of 30 percent of the credit will be awarded
for those investments during the second half of calendar year 2013 and for each full calendar year
thereafter. Beginning with the legislative report due on March 15, 2013, under subdivision 9, the
commissioner shall report on its plan under this subdivision and the results achieved.
    (b) If the target goal of 30 percent under paragraph (a) is not achieved for the six-month period
ending on December 31, 2013, the credit percentage under subdivision 5, paragraph (a), is increased
to 40 percent for a qualified investment made after December 31, 2013, in a greater Minnesota
business. This paragraph does not apply and the credit percentage for all qualified investments is
the rate provided under subdivision 5 for any calendar year beginning after a calendar year for which
the commissioner determines the 30 percent target has been satisfied. The commissioner shall timely
post notification of changes in the credit rate under this paragraph on the department's website.
   (c) For purposes of this section, a "greater Minnesota business" means a qualified small business
with its headquarters and 51 percent or more of its employees employed at Minnesota locations

    Subd. 10. Redevelopment district. (a) "Redevelopment district" means a type of tax increment
financing district consisting of a project, or portions of a project, within which the authority finds
by resolution that one or more of the following conditions, reasonably distributed throughout the
district, exists:
    (1) parcels consisting of 70 percent of the area of the district are occupied by buildings, streets,
utilities, paved or gravel parking lots, or other similar structures and m­o
                                                                           ­­ e ­h

                                                                                    ­ 50 percent or more
of the buildings, not including outbuildings, are structurally substandard to a degree requiring
substantial renovation or clearance;
    (2) the property consists of vacant, unused, underused, inappropriately used, or infrequently used
rail yards, rail storage facilities, or excessive or vacated railroad rights-of-way;
    (3) tank facilities, or property whose immediately previous use was for tank facilities, as defined
in section 115C.02, subdivision 15, if the tank facilities:
   (i) have or had a capacity of more than 1,000,000 gallons;
   (ii) are located adjacent to rail facilities; and
   (iii) have been removed or are unused, underused, inappropriately used, or infrequently used; or
   (4) a qualifying disaster area, as defined in subdivision 10b.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, "structurally substandard" shall mean containing defects
in structural elements or a combination of deficiencies in essential utilities and facilities, light and
ventilation, fire protection including adequate egress, layout and condition of interior partitions, or
similar factors, which defects or deficiencies are of sufficient total significance to justify substantial
renovation or clearance.
    (c) A building is not structurally substandard if it is in compliance with the building code
applicable to new buildings or could be modified to satisfy the building code at a cost of less than
15 percent of the cost of constructing a new structure of the same square footage and type on
the site. The municipality may find that a building is not disqualified as structurally substandard
under the preceding sentence on the basis of reasonably available evidence, such as the size,
type, and age of the building, the average cost of plumbing, electrical, or structural repairs, or
other similar reliable evidence. The municipality may not make such a determination without an
interior inspection of the property, but need not have an independent, expert appraisal prepared of
the cost of repair and rehabilitation of the building. An interior inspection of the property is not
required, if the municipality finds that (1) the municipality or authority is unable to gain access to
the property after using its best efforts to obtain permission from the party that owns or controls
the property; and (2) the evidence otherwise supports a reasonable conclusion that the building
is structurally substandard. Items of evidence that support such a conclusion include recent fire
or police inspections, on-site property tax appraisals or housing inspections, exterior evidence
of deterioration, or other similar reliable evidence. Written documentation of the findings and
reasons why an interior inspection was not conducted must be made and retained under section
469.175, subdivision 3, clause (1). Failure of a building to be disqualified under the provisions
of this paragraph is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition to determining that the building is
substandard.
   (d) A parcel is deemed to be occupied by a structurally substandard building for purposes of the

finding under paragraph (a) or by the improvements described in paragraph (e) if all of the following
conditions are met:
    (1) the parcel was occupied by a substandard building or met the requirements of paragraph (e),
as the case may be, within three years of the filing of the request for certification of the parcel as
part of the district with the county auditor;
    (2) the substandard building or the improvements described in paragraph (e) were demolished
or removed by the authority or the demolition or removal was financed by the authority or was done
by a developer under a development agreement with the authority;
    (3) the authority found by resolution before the demolition or removal that the parcel was
occupied by a structurally substandard building or met the requirements of paragraph (e) and that
after demolition and clearance the authority intended to include the parcel within a district; and
    (4) upon filing the request for certification of the tax capacity of the parcel as part of a district,
the authority notifies the county auditor that the original tax capacity of the parcel must be adjusted
as provided by section 469.177, subdivision 1, paragraph (f).
    (e) For purposes of this subdivision, a parcel is not occupied by buildings, streets, utilities, paved
or gravel parking lots, or other similar structures unless 15 percent of the area of the parcel contains
buildings, streets, utilities, paved or gravel parking lots, or other similar structures.
    (f) For districts consisting of two or more noncontiguous areas, each area must qualify as a
redevelopment district under paragraph (a) to be included in the district, and the entire area of the
district must satisfy paragraph (a).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.174, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 19a. Soil deficiency district. "Soil deficiency district" means a type of tax increment
financing district consisting of a project, or portions of a project, within which the authority finds
by resolution that the following conditions exist:
     (1) parcels consisting of 70 percent of the area of the district contain unusual terrain or soil
deficiencies which require substantial filling, grading, or other physical preparation for use and a
parcel is eligible for inclusion if at least 50 percent of the area of the parcel requires substantial
filling, grading, or other physical preparation for use; and
    (2) the estimated cost of the physical preparation under clause (1), but excluding costs directly
related to roads as defined in section 160.01, and local improvements as described in sections
429.021, subdivision 1, clauses (1) to (7), (11), and (12), and 430.01, exceeds the fair market value
of the land before completion of the preparation.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for districts for which the request for certification
is made after April 30, 2012.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.174, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

jurisdiction as a mining reclamation project area by finding by resolution, that parcels consisting of

at least 70 percent of the acreage, excluding street and railroad rights-of-way, are characterized by
one or more of the following conditions:
    (1) peat or other soils with geotechnical deficiencies that impair development of buildings or
infrastructure;
    (2) soils or terrain that requires substantial filling in order to permit the development of buildings
or infrastructure;
   (3) landfills, dumps, or similar deposits of municipal or private waste;
   (4) quarries or similar resource extraction sites;
   (5) floodway; and

substandard buildings occupy at least 30 percent of the area of the parcel.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for districts for which the request for certification

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.175, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Municipality approval. (a) A county auditor shall not certify the original net tax
capacity of a tax increment financing district until the tax increment financing plan proposed for
that district has been approved by the municipality in which the district is located. If an authority
that proposes to establish a tax increment financing district and the municipality are not the same,
the authority shall apply to the municipality in which the district is proposed to be located and shall
obtain the approval of its tax increment financing plan by the municipality before the authority may
use tax increment financing. The municipality shall approve the tax increment financing plan only
after a public hearing thereon after published notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the
municipality at least once not less than ten days nor more than 30 days prior to the date of the
hearing. The published notice must include a map of the area of the district from which increments
may be collected and, if the project area includes additional area, a map of the project area in which
the increments may be expended. The hearing may be held before or after the approval or creation
of the project or it may be held in conjunction with a hearing to approve the project.
    (b) Before or at the time of approval of the tax increment financing plan, the municipality shall
make the following findings, and shall set forth in writing the reasons and supporting facts for each
determination:
    (1) that the proposed tax increment financing district is a redevelopment district, a renewal
or renovation district, a housing district, a soils condition district, soil deficiency district, or an
economic development district; if the proposed district is a redevelopment district or a renewal or
renovation district, the reasons and supporting facts for the determination that the district meets the
criteria of section 469.174, subdivision 10, paragraph (a), clauses (1) and (2), or subdivision 10a,
must be documented in writing and retained and made available to the public by the authority until
118TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 9, 2012                                      7525

the district has been terminated;
   (2) that, in the opinion of the municipality:
    (i) the proposed development or redevelopment would not reasonably be expected to occur solely
through private investment within the reasonably foreseeable future; and
    (ii) the increased market value of the site that could reasonably be expected to occur without the
use of tax increment financing would be less than the increase in the market value estimated to result
from the proposed development after subtracting the present value of the projected tax increments
for the maximum duration of the district permitted by the plan. The requirements of this item do not
apply if the district is a housing district;
   (3) that the tax increment financing plan conforms to the general plan for the development or
redevelopment of the municipality as a whole;
    (4) that the tax increment financing plan will afford maximum opportunity, consistent with the
sound needs of the municipality as a whole, for the development or redevelopment of the project by
private enterprise;
   (5) that the municipality elects the method of tax increment computation set forth in section
469.177, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), if applicable; and
    (6) that for a redevelopment district, renewal and renovation district, soils condition district,
or soil deficiency district established by the authority in a mining reclamation project area, the
reasons and supporting facts for the determination that the mining reclamation project area meets the
requirements under section 469.174, subdivision 30, must be documented in writing and retained
and made available to the public by the authority until two years after the district is decertified.
These findings must have been made and documented no more than ten years before approval of
the tax increment financing plan for the district.
    (c) When the municipality and the authority are not the same, the municipality shall approve or
disapprove the tax increment financing plan within 60 days of submission by the authority. When
the municipality and the authority are not the same, the municipality may not amend or modify a
tax increment financing plan except as proposed by the authority pursuant to subdivision 4. Once
approved, the determination of the authority to undertake the project through the use of tax increment
financing and the resolution of the governing body shall be conclusive of the findings therein and
of the public need for the financing.
  (d) For a district that is subject to the requirements of paragraph (b), clause (2), item (ii), the
municipality's statement of reasons and supporting facts must include all of the following:
    (1) an estimate of the amount by which the market value of the site will increase without the use
of tax increment financing;
   (2) an estimate of the increase in the market value that will result from the development or
redevelopment to be assisted with tax increment financing; and
   (3) the present value of the projected tax increments for the maximum duration of the district
permitted by the tax increment financing plan.
   (e) For purposes of this subdivision, "site" means the parcels on which the development or

is made after April 30, 2012.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.176, subdivision 1b, is amended to read:
   Subd. 1b. Duration limits; terms. (a) No tax increment shall in any event be paid to the
authority:
    (1) after 15 years after receipt by the authority of the first increment for a renewal and renovation
district;
    (2) after 20 years after receipt by the authority of the first increment for a soils condition district
or a soil deficiency district;
   (3) after eight years after receipt by the authority of the first increment for an economic
development district;
   (4) for a housing district, a compact development district, or a redevelopment district, after 25
years from the date of receipt by the authority of the first increment.
    (b) For purposes of determining a duration limit under this subdivision or subdivision 1e that
is based on the receipt of an increment, any increments from taxes payable in the year in which
the district terminates shall be paid to the authority. This paragraph does not affect a duration limit
calculated from the date of approval of the tax increment financing plan or based on the recovery of
costs or to a duration limit under subdivision 1c. This paragraph does not supersede the restrictions
on payment of delinquent taxes in subdivision 1f.
    (c) An action by the authority to waive or decline to accept an increment has no effect for
purposes of computing a duration limit based on the receipt of increment under this subdivision
or any other provision of law. The authority is deemed to have received an increment for any year
in which it waived or declined to accept an increment, regardless of whether the increment was paid
to the authority.
    (d) Receipt by a hazardous substance subdistrict of an increment as a result of a reduction in
original net tax capacity under section 469.174, subdivision 7, paragraph (b), does not constitute
receipt of increment by the overlying district for the purpose of calculating the duration limit under
this section.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for districts for which the request for certification
is made after April 30, 2012.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 469.176, subdivision 4b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4b. Soils condition districts. Revenue derived from Tax increment from a soils
condition district may be used only to (1) acquire parcels on which the improvements described
in clause (2) will occur; (2) pay for the cost of removal or remedial action; and (3) pay for the
administrative expenses of the authority allocable to the district, including the cost of preparation of
the development action response plan. For a soils condition district located in a mining reclamation
project area, tax increments may also be expended on the additional cost of public improvements
directly caused by the removal or remedial action and located within the mining reclamation

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 469.176, subdivision 4c, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 4c. Economic development districts. (a) Revenue derived from tax increment from
an economic development district may not be used to provide improvements, loans, subsidies,
grants, interest rate subsidies, or assistance in any form to developments consisting of buildings
and ancillary facilities, if more than 15 percent of the buildings and facilities (determined on the
basis of square footage) are used for a purpose other than:
    (1) the manufacturing or production of tangible personal property, including processing resulting
in the change in condition of the property;
   (2) warehousing, storage, and distribution of tangible personal property, excluding retail sales;
   (3) research and development related to the activities listed in clause (1) or (2);
   (4) telemarketing if that activity is the exclusive use of the property;
   (5) tourism facilities;
   (6) qualified border retail facilities; or
   (7) space necessary for and related to the activities listed in clauses (1) to (6).
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, revenues derived from tax increment
from an economic development district may be used to provide improvements, loans, subsidies,
grants, interest rate subsidies, or assistance in any form for up to 15,000 square feet of any
separately owned commercial facility located within the municipal jurisdiction of a small city, if the
revenues derived from increments are spent only to assist the facility directly or for administrative
expenses, the assistance is necessary to develop the facility, and all of the increments, except those
for administrative expenses, are spent only for activities within the district.
   (c) A city is a small city for purposes of this subdivision if the city was a small city in the year in
which the request for certification was made and applies for the rest of the duration of the district,
regardless of whether the city qualifies or ceases to qualify as a small city.
   (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) and the finding requirements of section
469.174, subdivision 12, tax increments from an economic development district may be used to
provide improvements, loans, subsidies, grants, interest rate subsidies, or assistance in any form to
developments consisting of buildings and ancillary facilities, if all the following conditions are met:

used to pay for the following costs for activities located within the mining reclamation project area:
   (1) acquisition of parcels on which the improvements described in clause (2) will occur;
    (2) the cost of correcting the unusual terrain or soil deficiencies and the additional cost of
installing public improvements directly caused by the deficiencies;
   (3) administrative expenses of the authority allocable to the district; and
    (4) costs described in subdivision 4j for the district, if these payments do not exceed 25 percent
of the tax increment from the district.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for districts for which the request for certification
is made after April 30, 2012.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 469.1763, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Expenditures outside district. (a) For each tax increment financing district, an amount
equal to at least 75 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments paid by properties in the
district must be expended on activities in the district or to pay bonds, to the extent that the proceeds
of the bonds were used to finance activities in the district or to pay, or secure payment of, debt service
on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment districts for which the request for
certification was made after June 30, 1995, the in-district percentage for purposes of the preceding
sentence is 80 percent. Not more than 25 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments
paid by properties in the district may be expended, through a development fund or otherwise, on
activities outside of the district but within the defined geographic area of the project except to pay,
or secure payment of, debt service on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment
districts for which the request for certification was made after June 30, 1995, the pooling percentage
for purposes of the preceding sentence is 20 percent. The revenue derived from tax increments for
the district that are expended on costs under section 469.176, subdivision 4h, paragraph (b), may
be deducted first before calculating the percentages that must be expended within and without the
district.
    (b) In the case of a housing district, a housing project, as defined in section 469.174, subdivision
11, is an activity in the district.
    (c) All administrative expenses are for activities outside of the district, except that if the only
expenses for activities outside of the district under this subdivision are for the purposes described
in paragraph (d), administrative expenses will be considered as expenditures for activities in the
district.

of entity do not qualify under this subdivision if the shares or ownership interests are traded on a
public stock exchange at any time during the three-year period ending on the decedent's date of
death. For purposes of this subdivision, an ownership interest includes the interest the decedent is
deemed to own under sections 2036, 2037, and 2038 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (3) During the decedent's taxable year that ended before the decedent's death, the trade or
business must not have been a passive activity within the meaning of section 469(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code and the decedent or the decedent's spouse must have materially participated in the
trade or business within the meaning of section 469(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, excluding
section 469(h)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and any other provision provided by Treasury
Department regulation that substitutes material participation in prior taxable years for material
participation in the taxable year that ended before the decedent's death.
   ­(3
     ­­) (4) The gross annual sales of the trade or business were $10,000,000 or less for the last
taxable year that ended before the date of the death of the decedent.

traded securities, or assets not used in the operation of the trade or business held by the corporation
or other entity must be deducted from the value of the property qualifying under this subdivision in
proportion to the decedent's share of ownership of the entity on the date of death.
    (6) The property does not consist of qualified farm property. For property consisting of shares of
stock or other ownership interests in an entity, the value of the qualified farm property held by the
corporation or other entity must be deducted from the value of the property qualifying under this
subdivision in proportion to the decedent's share of ownership of the entity on the date of death.

deemed to own under sections 2036, 2037, and 2038 of the Internal Revenue Code, for the
three-year period ending on the date of death of the decedent. In the case of a sole proprietor, if the
property replaced similar property within the three-year period, the replacement property will be
treated as having been owned for the three-year period ending on the date of death of the decedent.

9, clause (7); or 10, clause (5), an additional estate tax is imposed on the property. In the case of

    (b) The amount of the additional tax equals the amount of the exclusion claimed with respect to
the qualified interest disposed of by the estate under subdivision 8, paragraph (d), multiplied by 16

    (c) The initial fire state aid allocation amount is the amount available for apportionment as
fire state aid under subdivision 5, without inclusion of any additional funding amount to support
a minimum fire state aid amount under section 423A.02, subdivision 3, allocated one-half in
proportion to the population as shown in the last official statewide federal census for each fire
town and one-half in proportion to the estimated market value of each fire town, including (1)
the estimated market value of tax-exempt property and (2) the estimated market value of natural
resources lands receiving in lieu payments under sections 477A.11 to 477A.14, but excluding
the estimated market value of minerals. In the case of incorporated or municipal fire departments
furnishing fire protection to other cities, towns, or townships as evidenced by valid fire service
contracts filed with the commissioner, the distribution must be adjusted proportionately to take
into consideration the crossover fire protection service. Necessary adjustments must be made
to subsequent apportionments. In the case of municipalities or independent fire departments
qualifying for the aid, the commissioner shall calculate the state aid for the municipality or relief
association on the basis of the population and the estimated market value of the area furnished
fire protection service by the fire department as evidenced by duly executed and valid fire service
agreements filed with the commissioner. If one or more fire departments are furnishing contracted
fire service to a city, town, or township, only the population and estimated market value of the
area served by each fire department may be considered in calculating the state aid and the fire
departments furnishing service shall enter into an agreement apportioning among themselves the
percent of the population and the estimated market value of each service area. The agreement must
be in writing and must be filed with the commissioner.
    (d) The minimum fire state aid allocation amount is the amount in addition to the initial fire state
allocation amount that is derived from any additional funding amount to support a minimum fire state
aid amount under section 423A.02, subdivision 3, and allocated to municipalities with volunteer
firefighters relief associations or covered by the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter
retirement plan based on the number of active volunteer firefighters who are members of the relief
association as reported in the annual financial reporting for the calendar year 1993 to the Office of
the State Auditor, but not to exceed 30 active volunteer firefighters, so that all municipalities or fire
departments with volunteer firefighters relief associations receive in total at least a minimum fire
state aid amount per 1993 active volunteer firefighter to a maximum of 30 firefighters. If a relief
association is established after calendar year 1993 and before calendar year 2000, the number of
active volunteer firefighters who are members of the relief association as reported in the annual
financial reporting for calendar year 1998 to the Office of the State Auditor, but not to exceed 30
active volunteer firefighters, shall be used in this determination. If a relief association is established
after calendar year 1999, the number of active volunteer firefighters who are members of the relief
association as reported in the first annual financial reporting submitted to the Office of the State
Auditor, but not to exceed 20 active volunteer firefighters, must be used in this determination. If a
relief association is terminated as a result of providing retirement coverage for volunteer firefighters
by the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter retirement plan under chapter 353G, the
number of active volunteer firefighters of the municipality covered by the statewide plan as certified
by the executive director of the Public Employees Retirement Association to the commissioner and
the state auditor, but not to exceed 30 active firefighters, must be used in this determination.
   (e) Unless the firefighters of the applicable fire department are members of the voluntary

the treasurer of the municipality where the fire department is located and the treasurer of the
municipality shall, within 30 days of receipt of the fire state aid, transmit the aid to the relief
association if the relief association has filed a financial report with the treasurer of the municipality
and has met all other statutory provisions pertaining to the aid apportionment. If the firefighters
of the applicable fire department are members of the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer
firefighter retirement plan, the fire state aid must be paid to the executive director of the Public
Employees Retirement Association and deposited in the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer
firefighter retirement fund.
    (f) The commissioner may make rules to permit the administration of the provisions of this
section.
   (g) Any adjustments needed to correct prior misallocations must be made to subsequent
apportionments.

located in rural towns other than urban towns, unless allowed by resolution of the town electors. The
proceeds of the tax shall be paid into a fund reserved for these purposes. Any proceeds remaining in
the reserve fund at the time the tax is terminated or the district is dissolved shall be transferred and
irrevocably pledged to the debt service fund of the local unit to be used solely to reduce tax levies
for bonded indebtedness of taxable property in the district.

       l­ estimated market value, unless approved by resolution of the town electors.
   (c) If at any time the amounts available from the levy on property in the territory of the
organization are insufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds when due, the county shall
make payment from any available funds in the county treasury.
    (d) The amount of any taxes which are required to be levied outside of the territory of the
watershed management organization or unit or taken from the general funds of the county to pay
principal or interest on the bonds shall be reimbursed to the county from taxes levied within the
territory of the watershed management organization or unit.

    (d) For purposes of a provision of a home rule charter or of any special law that is not codified
in the statutes and that imposes a levy limitation based on market value or any limit on debt, the
issuance of bonds, certificates of indebtedness, or capital notes based on market value, the terms
"market value," "taxable market value," and "market valuation," whether equalized or unequalized,
mean "estimated market value" as defined in paragraph (a).
      Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.11, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Generally. Except as provided in this section or section 273.17, subdivision 1, all
property shall be valued at its market value. The market value as determined pursuant to this section
shall be stated such that any amount under $100 is rounded up to $100 and any amount exceeding
$100 shall be rounded to the nearest $100. In estimating and determining such value, the assessor
shall not adopt a lower or different standard of value because the same is to serve as a basis of
taxation, nor shall the assessor adopt as a criterion of value the price for which such property would
sell at a forced sale, or in the aggregate with all the property in the town or district; but the assessor
shall value each article or description of property by itself, and at such sum or price as the assessor
believes the same to be fairly worth in money. The assessor shall take into account the effect on the
market value of property of environmental factors in the vicinity of the property. In assessing any
tract or lot of real property, the value of the land, exclusive of structures and improvements, shall be
determined, and also the value of all structures and improvements thereon, and the aggregate value
of the property, including all structures and improvements, excluding the value of crops growing
upon cultivated land. In valuing real property upon which there is a mine or quarry, it shall be valued
at such price as such property, including the mine or quarry, would sell for at a fair, voluntary sale,
for cash, if the material being mined or quarried is not subject to taxation under section 298.015 and
the mine or quarry is not exempt from the general property tax under section 298.25. In valuing
real property which is vacant, platted property shall be assessed as provided in ­        su

subdivisions 14a and 14c. All property, or the use thereof, which is taxable under section 272.01,
subdivision 2, or 273.19, shall be valued at the market value of such property and not at the value
of a leasehold estate in such property, or at some lesser value than its market value.
      Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.124, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3a. Manufactured home park cooperative. (a) When a manufactured home park is
owned by a corporation or association organized under chapter 308A or 308B, and each person
who owns a share or shares in the corporation or association is entitled to occupy a lot within the
park, the corporation or association may claim homestead treatment for the park. Each lot must be
designated by legal description or number, and each lot is limited to not more than one-half acre of
land.

    (b) The manufactured home park shall be entitled to homestead treatment if all of the following
criteria are met:
    (1) the occupant or the cooperative corporation or association is paying the ad valorem property
taxes and any special assessments levied against the land and structure either directly, or indirectly
through dues to the corporation or association; and
   (2) the corporation or association organized under chapter 308A or 308B is wholly owned by
persons having a right to occupy a lot owned by the corporation or association.
    (c) A charitable corporation, organized under the laws of Minnesota with no outstanding stock,
and granted a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, qualifies for
homestead treatment with respect to a manufactured home park if its members hold residential
participation warrants entitling them to occupy a lot in the manufactured home park.
    (d) "Homestead treatment" under this subdivision means the class rate provided for class 4c
property classified under section 273.13, subdivision 25, paragraph (d), clause (5), item (ii). The

apply and the property taxes assessed against the park shall not be included in the determination of
taxes payable for rent paid under section 290A.03.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2012 and thereafter.
   Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.124, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
   Subd. 13. Homestead application. (a) A person who meets the homestead requirements
under subdivision 1 must file a homestead application with the county assessor to initially obtain
homestead classification.
    (b) The format and contents of a uniform homestead application shall be prescribed by the
commissioner of revenue. The application must clearly inform the taxpayer that this application
must be signed by all owners who occupy the property or by the qualifying relative and returned to
the county assessor in order for the property to receive homestead treatment.
    (c) Every property owner applying for homestead classification must furnish to the county
assessor the Social Security number of each occupant who is listed as an owner of the property
on the deed of record, the name and address of each owner who does not occupy the property,
and the name and Social Security number of each owner's spouse who occupies the property.
The application must be signed by each owner who occupies the property and by each owner's
spouse who occupies the property, or, in the case of property that qualifies as a homestead under
subdivision 1, paragraph (c), by the qualifying relative.
    If a property owner occupies a homestead, the property owner's spouse may not claim another
property as a homestead unless the property owner and the property owner's spouse file with the
assessor an affidavit or other proof required by the assessor stating that the property qualifies as a
homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (e).
    Owners or spouses occupying residences owned by their spouses and previously occupied with
the other spouse, either of whom fail to include the other spouse's name and Social Security number
on the homestead application or provide the affidavits or other proof requested, will be deemed
to have elected to receive only partial homestead treatment of their residence. The remainder of
118TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 9, 2012                                        7551

the residence will be classified as nonhomestead residential. When an owner or spouse's name and
Social Security number appear on homestead applications for two separate residences and only one
application is signed, the owner or spouse will be deemed to have elected to homestead the residence
for which the application was signed.
     The Social Security numbers, state or federal tax returns or tax return information, including the
federal income tax schedule F required by this section, or affidavits or other proofs of the property
owners and spouses submitted under this or another section to support a claim for a property tax
homestead classification are private data on individuals as defined by section 13.02, subdivision 12,
but, notwithstanding that section, the private data may be disclosed to the commissioner of revenue,
or, for purposes of proceeding under the Revenue Recapture Act to recover personal property taxes
owing, to the county treasurer.
    (d) If residential real estate is occupied and used for purposes of a homestead by a relative
of the owner and qualifies for a homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (c), in order for the
property to receive homestead status, a homestead application must be filed with the assessor. The
Social Security number of each relative and spouse of a relative occupying the property shall be
required on the homestead application filed under this subdivision. If a different relative of the
owner subsequently occupies the property, the owner of the property must notify the assessor within
30 days of the change in occupancy. The Social Security number of a relative or relative's spouse
occupying the property is private data on individuals as defined by section 13.02, subdivision 12,
but may be disclosed to the commissioner of revenue, or, for the purposes of proceeding under the
Revenue Recapture Act to recover personal property taxes owing, to the county treasurer.
    (e) The homestead application shall also notify the property owners that the application filed
under this section will not be mailed annually and that if the property is granted homestead status
for any assessment year, that same property shall remain classified as homestead until the property
is sold or transferred to another person, or the owners, the spouse of the owner, or the relatives no
longer use the property as their homestead. Upon the sale or transfer of the homestead property, a
certificate of value must be timely filed with the county auditor as provided under section 272.115.
Failure to notify the assessor within 30 days that the property has been sold, transferred, or that the
owner, the spouse of the owner, or the relative is no longer occupying the property as a homestead,
shall result in the penalty provided under this subdivision and the property will lose its current
homestead status.
    (f) If the homestead application is not returned within 30 days, the county will send a second
application to the present owners of record. The notice of proposed property taxes prepared under
section 275.065, subdivision 3, shall reflect the property's classification. If a homestead application
has not been filed with the county by December 15, the assessor shall classify the property as
nonhomestead for the current assessment year for taxes payable in the following year, provided
that the owner may be entitled to receive the homestead classification by proper application under
section 375.192.
    (g) At the request of the commissioner, each county must give the commissioner a list that
includes the name and Social Security number of each occupant of homestead property who is the
property owner, property owner's spouse, qualifying relative of a property owner, or a spouse of a
qualifying relative. The commissioner shall use the information provided on the lists as appropriate
under the law, including for the detection of improper claims by owners, or relatives of owners,
under chapter 290A.
7552                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [118TH DAY

     (h) If the commissioner finds that a property owner may be claiming a fraudulent homestead,
the commissioner shall notify the appropriate counties. Within 90 days of the notification, the
county assessor shall investigate to determine if the homestead classification was properly claimed.
If the property owner does not qualify, the county assessor shall notify the county auditor who will
determine the amount of homestead benefits that had been improperly allowed. For the purpose
of this section, "homestead benefits" means the tax reduction resulting from the classification as a
homestead and the homestead market value exclusion under section 273.13, the taconite homestead
credit under section 273.135, the ­ r­

under section 273.1384, and the supplemental homestead credit under section 273.1391.
    The county auditor shall send a notice to the person who owned the affected property at the time
the homestead application related to the improper homestead was filed, demanding reimbursement
of the homestead benefits plus a penalty equal to 100 percent of the homestead benefits. The person
notified may appeal the county's determination by serving copies of a petition for review with county
officials as provided in section 278.01 and filing proof of service as provided in section 278.01 with
the Minnesota Tax Court within 60 days of the date of the notice from the county. Procedurally,
the appeal is governed by the provisions in chapter 271 which apply to the appeal of a property
tax assessment or levy, but without requiring any prepayment of the amount in controversy. If the
amount of homestead benefits and penalty is not paid within 60 days, and if no appeal has been
filed, the county auditor shall certify the amount of taxes and penalty to the county treasurer. The
county treasurer will add interest to the unpaid homestead benefits and penalty amounts at the rate
provided in section 279.03 for real property taxes becoming delinquent in the calendar year during
which the amount remains unpaid. Interest may be assessed for the period beginning 60 days after
demand for payment was made.
    If the person notified is the current owner of the property, the treasurer may add the total amount
of homestead benefits, penalty, interest, and costs to the ad valorem taxes otherwise payable on the
property by including the amounts on the property tax statements under section 276.04, subdivision
3. The amounts added under this paragraph to the ad valorem taxes shall include interest accrued
through December 31 of the year preceding the taxes payable year for which the amounts are first
added. These amounts, when added to the property tax statement, become subject to all the laws for
the enforcement of real or personal property taxes for that year, and for any subsequent year.
    If the person notified is not the current owner of the property, the treasurer may collect the
amounts due under the Revenue Recapture Act in chapter 270A, or use any of the powers granted
in sections 277.20 and 277.21 without exclusion, to enforce payment of the homestead benefits,
penalty, interest, and costs, as if those amounts were delinquent tax obligations of the person who
owned the property at the time the application related to the improperly allowed homestead was
filed. The treasurer may relieve a prior owner of personal liability for the homestead benefits, penalty,
interest, and costs, and instead extend those amounts on the tax lists against the property as provided
in this paragraph to the extent that the current owner agrees in writing. On all demands, billings,
property tax statements, and related correspondence, the county must list and state separately the
amounts of homestead benefits, penalty, interest and costs being demanded, billed or assessed.
    (i) Any amount of homestead benefits recovered by the county from the property owner shall be
distributed to the county, city or town, and school district where the property is located in the same
proportion that each taxing district's levy was to the total of the three taxing districts' levy for the
current year. Any amount recovered attributable to taconite homestead credit shall be transmitted
118TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 9, 2012                                        7553

to the St. Louis County auditor to be deposited in the taconite property tax relief account. Any
amount recovered that is attributable to supplemental homestead credit is to be transmitted to the
commissioner of revenue for deposit in the general fund of the state treasury. The total amount of
penalty collected must be deposited in the county general fund.
    (j) If a property owner has applied for more than one homestead and the county assessors cannot
determine which property should be classified as homestead, the county assessors will refer the
information to the commissioner. The commissioner shall make the determination and notify the
counties within 60 days.
     (k) In addition to lists of homestead properties, the commissioner may ask the counties to furnish
lists of all properties and the record owners. The Social Security numbers and federal identification
numbers that are maintained by a county or city assessor for property tax administration purposes,
and that may appear on the lists retain their classification as private or nonpublic data; but may be
viewed, accessed, and used by the county auditor or treasurer of the same county for the limited
purpose of assisting the commissioner in the preparation of microdata samples under section
270C.12.
    (l) On or before April 30 each year beginning in 2007, each county must provide the
commissioner with the following data for each parcel of homestead property by electronic means
as defined in section 289A.02, subdivision 8:
    (i) the property identification number assigned to the parcel for purposes of taxes payable in the
current year;
   (ii) the name and Social Security number of each occupant of homestead property who is the
property owner, property owner's spouse, qualifying relative of a property owner, or spouse of a
qualifying relative;
   (iii) the classification of the property under section 273.13 for taxes payable in the current year
and in the prior year;
    (iv) an indication of whether the property was classified as a homestead for taxes payable in the
current year because of occupancy by a relative of the owner or by a spouse of a relative;
   (v) the property taxes payable as defined in section 290A.03, subdivision 13, for the current year
and the prior year;
   (vi) the market value of improvements to the property first assessed for tax purposes for taxes
payable in the current year;
    (vii) the assessor's estimated market value assigned to the property for taxes payable in the
current year and the prior year;
    (viii) the taxable market value assigned to the property for taxes payable in the current year and
the prior year;
   (ix) whether there are delinquent property taxes owing on the homestead;
   (x) the unique taxing district in which the property is located; and
   (xi) such other information as the commissioner decides is necessary.

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.1398, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Disparity reduction aid. The amount of disparity aid certified for each taxing district
within each unique taxing jurisdiction for taxes payable in the prior year shall be multiplied by the
ratio of (1) the jurisdiction's tax capacity using the class rates for taxes payable in the year for which
aid is being computed, to (2) its tax capacity using the class rates for taxes payable in the year prior to
that for which aid is being computed, both based upon taxable market values for taxes payable in the
year prior to that for which aid is being computed. If the commissioner determines that insufficient
information is available to reasonably and timely calculate the numerator in this ratio for the first
taxes payable year that a class rate change or new class rate is effective, the commissioner shall omit
the effects of that class rate change or new class rate when calculating this ratio for aid payable in
that taxes payable year. For aid payable in the year following a year for which such omission was
made, the commissioner shall use in the denominator for the class that was changed or created, the
tax capacity for taxes payable two years prior to that in which the aid is payable, based on taxable
market values for taxes payable in the year prior to that for which aid is being computed.
    Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 273.1398, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Disparity reduction credit. (a) Beginning with taxes payable in 1989, class 4a, class
3a, and class 3b property qualifies for a disparity reduction credit if: (1) the property is located in a
border city that has an enterprise zone designated pursuant to section 469.168, subdivision 4; (2) the
property is located in a city with a population greater than 2,500 and less than 35,000 according to
the 1980 decennial census; (3) the city is adjacent to a city in another state or immediately adjacent
to a city adjacent to a city in another state; and (4) the adjacent city in the other state has a population
of greater than 5,000 and less than 75,000 according to the 1980 decennial census.
    (b) The credit is an amount sufficient to reduce (i) the taxes levied on class 4a property to 2.3
percent of the property's taxable market value and (ii) the tax on class 3a and class 3b property to
2.3 percent of taxable market value.
    (c) The county auditor shall annually certify the costs of the credits to the Department of
Revenue. The department shall reimburse local governments for the property taxes forgone as the
result of the credits in proportion to their total levies.
    Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 275.011, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

    Subdivision 1. Determination of levy limit. The property tax levied for any purpose under a
special law that is not codified in Minnesota Statutes or a city charter provision and that is subject to
a mill rate limitation imposed by the special law or city charter provision, excluding levies subject
to mill rate limitations that use adjusted assessed values determined by the commissioner of revenue
under section 124.2131, must not exceed the following amount for the years specified:
   (a) for taxes payable in 1988, the product of the applicable mill rate limitation imposed by
special law or city charter provision multiplied by the total assessed valuation of all taxable property
subject to the tax as adjusted by the provisions of Minnesota Statutes 1986, sections 272.64; 273.13,
subdivision 7a; and 275.49;
    (b) for taxes payable in 1989, the product of (1) the property tax levy limitation for the taxes
payable year 1988 determined under clause (a) multiplied by (2) an index for market valuation
changes equal to the assessment year 1988 total market valuation of all taxable property subject to
the tax divided by the assessment year 1987 total market valuation of all taxable property subject to
the tax; and
    (c) for taxes payable in 1990 and subsequent years, the product of (1) the property tax levy
limitation for the previous year determined pursuant to this subdivision multiplied by (2) an index
for market valuation changes equal to the total market valuation of all taxable property subject to
the tax for the current assessment year divided by the total market valuation of all taxable property
subject to the tax for the previous assessment year.

    Subd. 4. Adjusted levy limit base. For taxes levied in 2008 through 2010, the adjusted levy
limit base is equal to the levy limit base computed under subdivision 2 or section 275.72, multiplied

    Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2011 Supplement, section 276.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Contents of tax statements. (a) The treasurer shall provide for the printing of the tax
statements. The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the property tax statement
and its contents. The tax statement must not state or imply that property tax credits are paid by the
state of Minnesota. The statement must contain a tabulated statement of the dollar amount due to
each taxing authority and the amount of the state tax from the parcel of real property for which a
particular tax statement is prepared. The dollar amounts attributable to the county, the state tax, the
voter approved school tax, the other local school tax, the township or municipality, and the total
of the metropolitan special taxing districts as defined in section 275.065, subdivision 3, paragraph
(i), must be separately stated. The amounts due all other special taxing districts, if any, may be
aggregated except that any levies made by the regional rail authorities in the county of Anoka,
Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, or Washington under chapter 398A shall be listed on a
separate line directly under the appropriate county's levy. If the county levy under this paragraph
includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581,
the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately stated from the remaining county levy
amount. In the case of Ramsey County, if the county levy under this paragraph includes an amount
for public library service under section 134.07, the amount attributable for that purpose may be
separated from the remaining county levy amount. The amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying
under the senior citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount
of property tax before subtraction of the deferred property tax amount. The amount of the tax on
contamination value imposed under sections 270.91 to 270.98, if any, must also be separately stated.
The dollar amounts, including the dollar amount of any special assessments, may be rounded to the
nearest even whole dollar. For purposes of this section whole odd-numbered dollars may be adjusted
to the next higher even-numbered dollar. The amount of market value excluded under section 273.11,
subdivision 16, if any, must also be listed on the tax statement.
   (b) The property tax statements for manufactured homes and sectional structures taxed as
personal property shall contain the same information that is required on the tax statements for real
property.
   (c) Real and personal property tax statements must contain the following information in the order
given in this paragraph. The information must contain the current year tax information in the right
column with the corresponding information for the previous year in a column on the left:
    (1) the property's estimated market value under section 273.11, subdivision 1;
    (2) the property's homestead market value exclusion under section 273.13, subdivision 35;
    (3) the property's taxable market value ­   a­f­er­

    (d) If the county uses envelopes for mailing property tax statements and if the county agrees, a
taxing district may include a notice with the property tax statement notifying taxpayers when the
taxing district will begin its budget deliberations for the current year, and encouraging taxpayers
to attend the hearings. If the county allows notices to be included in the envelope containing the
property tax statement, and if more than one taxing district relative to a given property decides to
include a notice with the tax statement, the county treasurer or auditor must coordinate the process
and may combine the information on a single announcement.

      287.08 TAX, HOW PAYABLE; RECEIPTS.
      (a) The tax imposed by sections 287.01 to 287.12 must be paid to the treasurer of any county in
7558                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                     [118TH DAY

this state in which the real property or some part is located at or before the time of filing the mortgage
for record. The treasurer shall endorse receipt on the mortgage and the receipt is conclusive proof that
the tax has been paid in the amount stated and authorizes any county recorder or registrar of titles to
record the mortgage. Its form, in substance, shall be "registration tax hereon of ..................... dollars
paid." If the mortgage is exempt from taxation the endorsement shall, in substance, be "exempt from
registration tax." In either case the receipt must be signed by the treasurer. In case the treasurer is
unable to determine whether a claim of exemption should be allowed, the tax must be paid as in
the case of a taxable mortgage. For documents submitted electronically, the endorsements and tax
amount shall be affixed electronically and no signature by the treasurer will be required. The actual
payment method must be arranged in advance between the submitter and the receiving county.
     (b) The county treasurer may refund in whole or in part any mortgage registry tax overpayment
if a written application by the taxpayer is submitted to the county treasurer within 3-1/2 years from
the date of the overpayment. If the county has not issued a denial of the application, the taxpayer
may bring an action in Tax Court in the county in which the tax was paid at any time after the
expiration of six months from the time that the application was submitted. A denial of refund may
be appealed within 60 days from the date of the denial by bringing an action in Tax Court in the
county in which the tax was paid. The action is commenced by the serving of a petition for relief
on the county treasurer, and by filing a copy with the court. The county attorney shall defend the
action. The county treasurer shall notify the treasurer of each county that has or would receive a
portion of the tax as paid.
    (c) If the county treasurer determines a refund should be paid, or if a refund is ordered by the
court, the county treasurer of each county that actually received a portion of the tax shall immediately
pay a proportionate share of three percent of the refund using any available county funds. The county
treasurer of each county that received, or would have received, a portion of the tax shall also pay
their county's proportionate share of the remaining 97 percent of the court-ordered refund on or
before the 20th day of the following month using solely the mortgage registry tax funds that would
be paid to the commissioner of revenue on that date under section 287.12. If the funds on hand
under this procedure are insufficient to fully fund 97 percent of the court-ordered refund, the county
treasurer of the county in which the action was brought shall file a claim with the commissioner of
revenue under section 16A.48 for the remaining portion of 97 percent of the refund, and shall pay
over the remaining portion upon receipt of a warrant from the state issued pursuant to the claim.
     (d) When any mortgage covers real property located in more than one county in this state the total
tax must be paid to the treasurer of the county where the mortgage is first presented for recording,
and the payment must be receipted as provided in paragraph (a). If the principal debt or obligation
secured by such a multiple county mortgage exceeds $10,000,000, the nonstate portion of the tax
must be divided and paid over by the county treasurer receiving it, on or before the 20th day of each
month after receipt, to the county or counties entitled in the ratio that the estimated market value
of the real property covered by the mortgage in each county bears to the estimated market value of
all the real property in this state described in the mortgage. In making the division and payment the
county treasurer shall send a statement giving the description of the real property described in the
mortgage and the estimated market value of the part located in each county. For this purpose, the
treasurer of any county may require the treasurer of any other county to certify to the former the
estimated market v ­­a­u

    (e) The mortgagor must pay the tax imposed by sections 287.01 to 287.12. The mortgagee may

undertake to collect and remit the tax on behalf of the mortgagor. If the mortgagee collects money
from the mortgagor to remit the tax on behalf of the mortgagor, the mortgagee has a fiduciary duty
to remit the tax on behalf of the mortgagor as to the amount of the tax collected for that purpose and
the mortgagor is relieved of any further obligation to pay the tax as to the amount collected by the
mortgagee for this purpose.
   Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 287.23, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Real property outside county. If any taxable deed or instrument describes any
real property located in more than one county in this state, the total tax must be paid to the treasurer
of the county where the document is first presented for recording, and the payment must be receipted
as provided in section 287.08. If the net consideration exceeds $700,000, the nonstate portion of
the tax must be divided and paid over by the county treasurer receiving it, on or before the 20th
day of each month after receipt, to the county or counties entitled in the ratio which the estimated
market value of the real property covered by the document in each county bears to the estimated
market value of all the real property in this state described in the document. In making the division
and payment the county treasurer shall send a statement to the other involved counties giving the
description of the real property described in the document and the estimated market value of the part
located in each county. The treasurer of any county may require the treasurer of any other county
to certify to the former the estimated market v ­­a­u

purpose.

    Subd. 2. Cash flow funding requirement. If the executive director determines that an account
in the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter retirement plan has insufficient assets to
meet the service pensions determined payable from the account, the executive director shall certify
the amount of the potential service pension shortfall to the municipality or municipalities and the
municipality or municipalities shall make an additional employer contribution to the account within
ten days of the certification. If more than one municipality is associated with the account, unless
the municipalities agree to a different allocation, the municipalities shall allocate the additional
employer contribution one-half in proportion to the population of each municipality and one-half in
proportion to the estimated market value of the property of each municipality.
   Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 365.025, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Major purchases: notice, petition, election. Before buying anything under subdivision
2 that costs more than 0.24177 percent of the estimated market value of the town, the town must
follow this subdivision.
    The town must publish in its official newspaper the board's resolution to pay for the property
over time. Then a petition for an election on the contract may be filed with the clerk. The petition
must be filed within ten days after the resolution is published. To require the election the petition
must be signed by a number of voters equal to ten percent of the voters at the last regular town
election. The contract then must be approved by a majority of those voting on the question. The
question may be voted on at a regular or special election.
   Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 366.095, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Certificates of indebtedness. The town board may issue certificates of

shall be payable in not more than ten years and be issued on the terms and in the manner as the
board may determine. If the amount of the certificates to be issued exceeds 0.25 percent of the
estimated market value of the town, they shall not be issued for at least ten days after publication
in a newspaper of general circulation in the town of the board's resolution determining to issue
them. If within that time, a petition asking for an election on the proposition signed by voters equal
to ten percent of the number of voters at the last regular town election is filed with the clerk, the
certificates shall not be issued until their issuance has been approved by a majority of the votes cast
on the question at a regular or special election. A tax levy shall be made to pay the principal and
interest on the certificates as in the case of bonds.
   Sec. 45. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 366.27, is amended to read:

the special taxes levied under this subdivision. Subject to the consent by resolution of the governing
body of the city in and for which it was created, an authority may levy a tax upon all taxable property
within that taxing district. The tax shall be extended, spread, and included with and as a part of the
general taxes for state, county, and municipal purposes by the county auditor, to be collected and
enforced therewith, together with the penalty, interest, and costs. As the tax, including any penalties,
interest, and costs, is collected by the county treasurer it shall be accumulated and kept in a separate
fund to be known as the "housing and redevelopment project fund." The money in the fund shall
be turned over to the authority at the same time and in the same manner that the tax collections for
the city are turned over to the city, and shall be expended only for the purposes of sections 469.001
to 469.047. It shall be paid out upon vouchers signed by the chair of the authority or an authorized
representative. The amount of the levy shall be an amount approved by the governing body of the

of the general jurisdiction governmental unit as additional security for bonds payable from income
or revenues of the project or the authority. The authority must find that the pledged revenues will
equal or exceed 110 percent of the principal and interest due on the bonds for each year. The proceeds
of the bonds must be used for a qualified housing development project or projects. The obligations
must be issued and sold in the manner and following the procedures provided by chapter 475, except
the obligations are not subject to approval by the electors, and the maturities may extend to not more
than 35 years for obligations sold to finance housing for the elderly and 40 years for other obligations
issued under this subdivision. The authority is the municipality for purposes of chapter 475.
    (b) The principal amount of the issue must be approved by the governing body of the general
jurisdiction governmental unit whose general obligation is pledged. Public hearings must be held on
issuance of the obligations by both the authority and the general jurisdiction governmental unit. The
hearings must be held at least 15 days, but not more than 120 days, before the sale of the obligations.

the general jurisdiction governmental unit whose general obligation is pledged, or (2) $3,000,000. In
the case of county or multicounty general obligation bonds, the outstanding general obligation bonds
of all cities in the county or counties issued under this subdivision must be added in calculating the
limit under clause (1).
    (d) "General jurisdiction governmental unit" means the city in which the housing development
project is located. In the case of a county or multicounty authority, the county or counties may act
as the general jurisdiction governmental unit. In the case of a multicounty authority, the pledge of
the general obligation is a pledge of a tax on the taxable property in each of the counties.

housing either for the elderly or for individuals and families with incomes not greater than 80
percent of the median family income as estimated by the United States Department of Housing and

Urban Development for the standard metropolitan statistical area or the nonmetropolitan county in
which the project is located. The project must be owned for the term of the bonds either by the
authority or by a limited partnership or other entity in which the authority or another entity under
the sole control of the authority is the sole general partner and the partnership or other entity must
receive (1) an allocation from the Department of Management and Budget or an entitlement issuer
of tax-exempt bonding authority for the project and a preliminary determination by the Minnesota
Housing Finance Agency or the applicable suballocator of tax credits that the project will qualify
for four percent low-income housing tax credits or (2) a reservation of nine percent low-income
housing tax credits from the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency or a suballocator of tax credits for
the project. A qualified housing development project may admit nonelderly individuals and families
with higher incomes if:
   (1) three years have passed since initial occupancy;
    (2) the authority finds the project is experiencing unanticipated vacancies resulting in insufficient
revenues, because of changes in population or other unforeseen circumstances that occurred after
the initial finding of adequate revenues; and
    (3) the authority finds a tax levy or payment from general assets of the general jurisdiction
governmental unit will be necessary to pay debt service on the bonds if higher income individuals
or families are not admitted.
    (f) The authority may issue bonds to refund bonds issued under this subdivision in accordance
with section 475.67. The finding of the adequacy of pledged revenues required by paragraph (a) and
the public hearing required by paragraph (b) shall not apply to the issuance of refunding bonds. This
paragraph applies to refunding bonds issued on and after July 1, 1992.

    Subd. 3. Levy limit. In any budget certified by the commissioners under this section, the
amount included for operation and maintenance shall not exceed an amount which, when extended
against the property taxable therefor under section 473.621, subdivision 5, will require a levy at a
rate of 0.00806 percent of estimated market value. Taxes levied by the corporation shall not affect
the amount or rate of taxes which may be levied by any other local government unit within the
metropolitan area under the provisions of any charter.
     Sec. 90. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 473.667, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Additional taxes. Nothing herein shall prevent the commission from levying a tax
not to exceed 0.00121 percent of estimated market value on taxable property within its taxing
jurisdiction, in addition to any levies found necessary for the debt service fund authorized by section
473.671. Nothing herein shall prevent the levy and appropriation for purposes of the commission
of any other tax on property or on any income, transaction, or privilege, when and if authorized by
law. All collections of any taxes so levied shall be included in the revenues appropriated for the
purposes referred to in this section, unless otherwise provided in the law authorizing the levies; but
no covenant as to the continuance or as to the rate and amount of any such levy shall be made with
the holders of the commission's bonds unless specifically authorized by law.

exclusive of any taxes levied to pay the share of the city for payments on bonded indebtedness of
the corporation provided for in Laws 1943, chapter 500. The levy of taxes authorized in Laws 1943,
chapter 500, shall be in addition to the maximum rate allowed to be levied to defray the cost of
government under the provisions of the charter of any city affected by Laws 1943, chapter 500.
      Sec. 92. Minnesota Statutes 2010, section 473.711, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Tax levy. (a) The commission may levy a tax on all taxable property in the district as
defined in section 473.702 to provide funds for the purposes of sections 473.701 to 473.716. The
tax shall not exceed the property tax levy limitation determined in this subdivision. A participating
county may agree to levy an additional tax to be used by the commission for the purposes of sections
473.701 to 473.716 but the sum of the county's and commission's taxes may not exceed the county's
proportionate share of the property tax levy limitation determined under this subdivision based on
the ratio of its total net tax capacity to the total net tax capacity of the entire district as adjusted by
section 270.12, subdivision 3. The auditor of each county in the district shall add the amount of the
levy made by the district to other taxes of the county for collection by the county treasurer with other
taxes. When collected, the county treasurer shall make settlement of the tax with the district in the
same manner as other taxes are distributed to political subdivisions. No county shall levy any tax
for mosquito, disease vectoring tick, and black gnat (Simuliidae) control except under this section.
The levy shall be in addition to other taxes authorized by law.
    (b) The property tax levied by the Metropolitan Mosquito Control Commission shall not exceed
the product of (i) the commission's property tax levy limitation for the previous year determined
under this subdivision multiplied by (ii) an index for market valuation changes equal to the total
estimated market v  ­­

officer. The initial resolution of the governing body shall refer to this subdivision as authority for
the issue, state the amount of bonds to be issued and refer to the list of indebtedness to be funded

newspaper published in the municipality or if there be no such newspaper, in a legal newspaper
published in the county seat. Such bonds may be issued without the submission of the question
of their issue to the electors unless within ten days after the second publication of the resolution a
petition requesting such election signed by ten or more voters who are taxpayers of the municipality,
shall be filed with the recording officer. In event such petition is filed, no bonds shall be issued
hereunder unless authorized by a majority of the electors voting on the question.

state board shall have authority to purchase the same to an amount not exceeding 3.63 percent
of the estimated market value of the taxable property of the municipality, according to the last
preceding assessment. The obligations shall not run for a shorter period than one year, nor for a
longer period than 30 years and shall bear interest at a rate to be fixed by the state board but not less
than two percent per annum. Forthwith upon the delivery to the state of Minnesota of any obligations
issued by virtue thereof, the commissioner of management and budget shall certify to the respective

   Sec. 5. PURPOSE STATEMENTS; TAX EXPENDITURES.
    Subdivision 1. Authority. This section is intended to fulfill the requirement under Minnesota
Statutes, section 3.192, that a bill creating, renewing, or continuing a tax expenditure provide a
purpose for the tax expenditure and a standard or goal against which its effectiveness may be
measured.
    Subd. 2. Federal conformity. The provisions of article 8 conforming Minnesota individual
income tax to changes in federal law are intended to simplify compliance with and administration
of the individual income tax.
    Subd. 3. Employment of qualified veterans tax credit. The provisions of article 8, section 15,
providing a tax credit for the employment of qualified veterans, are intended to give an incentive to
employers to hire returning veterans who would otherwise be unemployed and to encourage their
reintegration into the community. The standard against which the effectiveness of the credit is to be
measured is the additional number of veterans who are hired as a result of the tax credit.
    Subd. 4. Extension of historic structure rehabilitation credit. The provisions of article 8,
section 14, extending the sunset of the historic structure rehabilitation credit are intended to create
and retain jobs related to rehabilitation of historic structures in Minnesota. The standard against
which the effectiveness of the extension of the credit is to be measured is the number of jobs created
through the rehabilitation of historic structures and the number of historic structures rehabilitated
and placed in service.
    Subd. 5. Exemption of certain laboratory services from the health care provider tax. The
provisions of article 9, section 2, exempting laboratory services on specimens collected outside
the state from the health care provider tax is intended to eliminate a competitive disadvantage for
laboratories located in Minnesota when competing to provide services with laboratories located
outside of the state.
    Subd. 6. Sales tax exemption for established religious orders. The provisions of article 9,
section 7, exempting certain sales between a religious order and an affiliated institute of higher
education is intended to retain an existing sales tax exemption that exists between St. John's Abbey
and St. John's University after a governing restructure between the two entities.
    Subd. 7. Sales tax exemption for nursing homes and boarding care homes. The provisions of
article 9, section 8, exempting certain nursing homes and boarding care homes is intended to clarify
that an existing exemption for these facilities is not affected by a recent property tax case related to
defining nonprofit organizations engaged in charitable activities.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 6. BUDGET RESERVE.
   The commissioner of management and budget shall cancel $27,900,000 to the general fund from
