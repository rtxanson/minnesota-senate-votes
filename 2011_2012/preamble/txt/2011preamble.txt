                                   Introduction
   The 2011 Session of the Eighty-Seventh Legislature convened January 4, and for the first time
since 1972, was organized with a Republican majority. 24 new Senators (21 Republican and 3 DFL)
were elected in the 2010 election, giving the Senate a political makeup of 37 Republicans and 30
DFL-ers.
   Senator Amy T. Koch (R), Buffalo, was elected Majority Leader and Chair of the Committee on
Rules and Administration.
   Senator Thomas M. Bakk (DFL), Cook, was elected Minority Leader.
   Senator Michelle L. Fischbach (R), Paynesville, was elected President of the Senate.
   It was the first time in the Senate's history that a woman was elected as Majority Leader and as
President of the Senate.
    Senator Ellen Anderson (DFL), St. Paul, resigned effective March 20, 2011, after being appointed
to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission by Governor Mark Dayton. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL),
Falcon Heights, won a special election on April 12, 2011, to fill the vacancy in District 66. Senator
McGuire was sworn in on April 18, 2011.
   The 2011 session adjourned on Monday, May 23, without legislation being enacted to balance
the state's budget and finance the operation of much of state government. Due to the lack of
approved funding, most areas of state government were shutdown on July 1. A Special Session
was called by Governor Dayton on July 19, after legislative leaders and the Governor reached an
agreement to balance the state's budget. The Special Session lasted one day and legislation was
enacted that balanced the state's budget and financed state government operations, ending the
government shutdown.
   Senator Linda Scheid (DFL), Brooklyn Park, passed away on June 15, 2011, after a long battle
with cancer. A special election to fill the vacancy in District 46 has been called by Governor Dayton
for October 18, 2011.
   Senator Linda Berglin (DFL), Minneapolis, resigned effective August 15, 2011, to dedicate her
time to employment with Hennepin County. A special election to fill the vacancy in District 61 has
been called by Governor Dayton for October 18, 2011.
   Senator Lawrence J. Pogemiller (DFL), Minneapolis, resigned effective November 7, 2011, after
being appointed Director of the Office of Higher Education by Governor Dayton. A special election
to fill the vacancy in District 59 has been called for January 10, 2012.
   The Eighty-Seventh Legislature will reconvene on Tuesday, January 24, 2012.
